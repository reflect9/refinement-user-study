NATO said up to 150 insurgents might have been killed in the fighting.  Two large groups of insurgents were spotted gathering on the Pakistan side of the border and were tracked as they crossed into Afghanistan, NATO said in a statement released in Kabul.  Afghan Army soldiers and NATO troops laid an ambush for the groups about half a mile inside Afghanistan, using air and ground forces, said Gen. Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.  The insurgents were in trucks loaded with men and weapons and crossed the border about 2 a.m., General Azimi said. Afghan and NATO forces set up an ambush in a deserted area near the border, he said. He reported no Afghan or NATO casualties, but estimated that about 80 insurgents were killed. The clash occurred in the Barmal district of Paktika Province, which borders the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, one of the most lawless areas of the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Militants from both countries, along with hundreds of foreign fighters, operate Taliban training camps there and mount frequent attacks across the border into Afghanistan.  The Pakistani military guards the border but has failed to stem cross-border attacks; NATO officials say there has been a marked increase in infiltration at the border since September compared with last year.  ''Pakistani military liaison officers were kept fully informed throughout the operation,'' NATO said in its statement.",

            "fulltext": "At least 250 militants were killed and an American helicopter was shot down in violent clashes near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday, Iraqi officials said.  For 15 hours, Iraqi forces backed by American helicopters and tanks battled hundreds of gunmen hiding in a date palm orchard near the village of Zarqaa, about 120 miles south of Baghdad, by a river and a large grain silo that is surrounded by orchards, the officials said.  It appeared to be one of the deadliest battles in Iraq since the American-led invasion four years ago, and was the first major fight for Iraqi forces in Najaf Province since they took over control of security there from the Americans in December.  That handover was trumpeted by the Iraqi government at the time as a sign of its progress in regaining more control of Iraqi territory.  The American military confirmed that the helicopter crashed around 1:30 p.m., and said that two soldiers aboard died in the crash. But American military officials said they could not confirm the total number of dead in the battle.  Col. Ali Numaas, a spokesman for the Iraqi security forces in Najaf, and an Interior Ministry official said the number of dead could rise. They said that the fighting stopped just after 10 p.m. and that most of those killed were militants. An employee at a local morgue said at least two Iraqi policemen were among the dead.  In a statement, the United States military said bodies of the two soldiers aboard the helicopter were recovered. The crash, at least the third involving an American helicopter in Iraq over the past week, is under investigation.  The precise affiliation of the militants was unclear.  Asad Abu Ghalal, the governor of Najaf Province, said the fighters in the orchard were Iraqi and foreign, some wearing the brown, white and maroon regalia of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. He said they had come to assassinate Shiite clerics and attack religious convoys that were gathering in Najaf, one of Shiite Islam's holiest cities, and other southern cities for Ashura, a Shiite holiday that starts Monday night.  At a news conference on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Ghalal said the fighters called themselves the Soldiers of Heaven, and seemed to be part of a wider Sunni effort to disrupt Ashura, which marks the seventh-century death of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson Hussein.  The holiday attracts hundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims to Karbala, where Hussein is believed to have been killed, and for days, the roads of southern Iraq have been filled with convoys of pilgrims beating drums and preparing for the day's rituals, which include self-flagellation. In past years, Ashura has been a magnet for violent attacks from Sunnis, with at least 180 people killed on the holiday three years ago.  But two senior Shiite clerics said the gunmen were part of a Shiite splinter group that Saddam Hussein helped build in the 1990s to compete with followers of the venerated Shiite religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. They said the group, calling itself the Mehwadiya, was loyal to Ahmad bin al-Hassan al-Basri, an Iraqi cleric who had a falling out with Muhammad Bakr al-Sadr -- father-in-law of the Shiite leader Moktada al-Sadr -- in Hawza, a revered Shiite seminary in Najaf.  The clerics spoke on condition of anonymity because they said they had been ordered not to discuss Shiite divisions.  Iraqi officials said the group of 100 to 600 fighters was discovered in the orchard Saturday night, leading to a midnight meeting of local authorities who hatched an attack plan.  ''We agreed to carry out an operation to take them by surprise,'' said Mr. Ghalal, the Najaf governor.  At dawn, the governor said, the area was surrounded and the offensive began. He said the militants had antiaircraft rockets and long-range sniper rifles, and, according to a soldier involved in the fighting, Iraqi security forces encountered heavy resistance. Commanders called for reinforcements and a brigade of soldiers from nearby Babil Province joined the fight.  Eventually, Iraqi officials said, they called on the United States military for help. American tanks and helicopter gunships arrived, and gun battles continued into the night. By 10:30 p.m., the gunfire had died down and Iraqi troops began searching the area for bodies.  Elsewhere in the heavily Shiite south, there were other signs of potential strikes on Ashura. Officials in Karbala said the police arrested three men -- a Saudi, an Afghan and a Moroccan -- who were found on the road between Najaf and Karbala with a suicide bomb belt and explosives in their car. The officials said the vehicle had been hollowed out so it could be used as a car bomb.  The United States military also announced the deaths of a soldier and a marine on Saturday.  The marine died from combat wounds in Anbar Province, where American troops have been battling Sunni insurgents for months. The soldier, a member of the military police, was killed when a roadside bomb exploded near his patrol north of Baghdad.  Throughout Iraq, the drumbeat of daily violence continued.  In Kirkuk, two car bombs at a Kurdish car dealership and a Kurdish market killed at least 17 people, authorities said.  In Baghdad, 54 bodies were found, many showing signs of torture. At least five girls were killed and 20 wounded when a mortar round hit a school in Adil, a Sunni neighborhood.  At 7:30 a.m., a bomb inside a minibus exploded in a Shiite area of the capital east of the Tigris River, killing one and wounding five. Two hours later, in the Sunni area of Yarmouk in western Baghdad, gunmen killed four people, including a consultant with the Ministry of Industry and his daughter, who were shot on their way to work.  After dark Sunday night, residents of the Yarmouk neighborhood reported that heavy clashes had broken out, with gun and mortar fire raining down for hours.  Also on Sunday, Saddam Hussein's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid acknowledged in court that he had given orders to destroy scores of villages during Iraq's campaign against the Kurds in the 1980s.  Prosecutors introduced two dozen documents they said incriminated members of the Hussein government in the killing of tens of thousands of Kurds.  The Associated Press reported that Mr. Majid, also known as Chemical Ali because he is accused of using chemical weapons against the Kurds, said the area ''was full of Iranian agents.''  ''We had to isolate these saboteurs,'' he said.  He added, ''I am the one who gave orders to the army to demolish villages and relocate the villagers.''  THE REACH OF WAR",

The attack occurred as Afghan laborers were lining up for security checks at the pedestrian entrance of the base known as Camp Salerno. The bomber was trying to enter the base, NATO said, but detonated the vest when he reached the search point.  Arsalah Jamal, the Afghan provincial governor of Khost, visited the scene after the bombing and confirmed the deaths of eight civilian laborers and two Afghan security guards, though a NATO statement put the toll at six Afghan civilians and two policemen.  ''I confirm 10 people, including two Afghan security guards, were killed in a suicide attack at the entrance of the military base,'' Mr. Jamal said.  He said 14 others had been wounded in the attack, all Afghan civilian daily workers for the military base. NATO said only five had been wounded.  Khost, in eastern Afghanistan, borders tribal areas in Pakistan that Afghan and Western officials contend offer a haven for militants organizing suicide attacks.  ''Suicide attack is not an Afghani phenomenon,'' Mr. Jamal said by telephone. ''There are madrasas and camps on the other side of the border where some elements promise passport and visa'' to ''young people for killing themselves and others.''  The attack was one of the deadliest since Sept. 30, 2006, when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the gates of the Interior Ministry in Kabul, killing 12 people and wounding up to 40.

The fighting took place in the neighborhood around Haifa Street, a mostly Sunni Arab enclave with a small Shiite population.  A spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Muhammad al-Askari, said that an Iraqi Army unit had gone into the area after receiving reports that Sunni fighters had set up a fake security checkpoint and were taking Shiites aside and shooting them.  The bodies of many of those killed at the roadblock were then hanged from the lampposts, Mr. Askari said.  He said that Iraqi soldiers had moved in and surrounded the fighters at the checkpoint. In initial fighting there, 30 of the men were killed and several more were arrested, Mr. Askari said, adding that the neighborhood remained locked down. There was no way to verify the figures.  Residents living nearby said that they were hearing continued fighting through the night but that it was impossible to know precisely what was happening.  In the same neighborhood, there were reports of clashes as government forces moved to collect 27 bodies dumped behind a local hospital. But it was unclear whether the firefight with Iraqi troops was related.  The government said Saturday that 72 bodies were recovered around the city on Saturday, most showing signs of torture.  Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki announced Saturday the beginning of a new Baghdad security operation and promised to purge the government security forces of militia fighters and others with sectarian aims.

            "fulltext": "After five days of clashes in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian factions on Tuesday mostly observed the latest cease-fire, though one Hamas member was shot dead.  Also, the Israeli Air Force bombed a tunnel near the eastern edge of the Gaza Strip, saying that Palestinian militants were digging it to enter Israel and carry out an attack. The tunnel was near the Karni crossing, which is used to move goods between Israel and Gaza.  The two main Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, held late night talks on Monday and agreed on a truce that took effect at 3 a.m. Tuesday. While Gaza was mostly calm during the day, several previous cease-fires have broken down and there were doubts about this one as well.  In one incident, a local Hamas leader was shot dead in the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis. The shooting appeared to be a revenge attack by a family aligned with Fatah, which recently had a relative killed in the fighting, according to Palestinian residents of the town.  More than 30 Palestinians have been killed in gun battles since Thursday, and about 60 have died over the past two months.  Egypt, which has often mediated between the Palestinian factions in recent years, helped broker the latest truce.  While Gazans welcomed the reopening of shops and the semblance of normalcy that prevailed on the streets on Tuesday, many said the truce would remain vulnerable unless Hamas and Fatah could agree to work together in the government.  A good deal of the fighting has involved members of the Palestinian security forces. Many members are loyal to Fatah, which long dominated Palestinian politics, but Hamas created a security service, known as the Executive Force, after it came to power a year ago.  Months of negotiations have failed to produce a deal between Hamas, the radical Islamic group that controls much of the government, and Fatah, led by the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas.  Mr. Abbas, speaking in Cairo after a meeting with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, said Hamas's Executive Force was ''illegitimate and illegal.''  Mr. Abbas also condemned a suicide bombing on Monday by a Palestinian in the southern Israeli resort town of Eilat, which killed three workers at a bakery.  The Palestinian leader said the bombing was ''not in the interest of the Palestinian people.'' Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, which is linked to Fatah, had claimed responsibility for the bombing with Islamic Jihad.  Israel has given no indication that it plans a major military response to the suicide bombing, the first such attack in Israel in nine months.  ''The initiative will be ours, and we have no intention of relaying what we plan to do,'' Amir Peretz, the defense minister, said during a visit to Eilat.  However, Israeli newspapers, citing political and military officials, said no large-scale operations were planned.  In a separate development, Israel's deputy prime minister, Shimon Peres, met in Qatar with the emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. That was the highest-level meeting in years between officials of the countries.  The emir urged Israel to hold talks with the Palestinian government, according to the Web site of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which had a reporter traveling with Mr. Peres. Israel, which classifies Hamas as a terrorist group, refuses to deal with the organization, and Hamas does not recognize Israel.  Israel and Qatar do not have diplomatic relations, though there is an Israeli trade mission in the Qatari capital, Doha. Mr. Peres visited Qatar when he was prime minister in 1996.",

Iraqi officials in the area said it had been shot down, though there was no immediate confirmation from American officials.  In separate episodes, five American soldiers were killed and three wounded in a battle with gunmen who attacked the local governor's office in the Shiite holy city of Karbala, and two soldiers died from other attacks, military officials said.  It was not clear whether all those on the helicopter were Americans. If they were, 20 uniformed Americans died Saturday. On the worst day of the war for American forces, Jan. 26, 2005, 37 American service members died. Thirty-one of them died when a Marine helicopter crashed in the western desert, and six others in combat that day.  An Interior Ministry official and the police in Diyala Province said Saturday that the American helicopter was shot down about 4 p.m. by insurgents who had fired missiles or grenades from at least two locations. It crashed near Tarrafa Village, they said, over a rural area near the Diyala River.  The American military said that debris had been immediately surrounded and secured. Several hours after the crash, soldiers were still combing through the wreckage.  A spokesman declined to provide details on the type of aircraft or how it crashed. The number of people aboard suggested that it had been a Black Hawk transport helicopter, which typically carries about 10 passengers and 4 crew members.  The crash occurred northeast of Baghdad near Baquba, where American and Iraqi forces have been battling Sunni insurgents and Shiite militia forces for months.  The American military also announced seven other deaths on Saturday and three deaths from earlier in the week. In addition to the five soldiers killed during the battle in Karbala, a soldier was killed in northern Baghdad on Saturday when a roadside bomb exploded near his patrol, and another, assigned to a unit of engineers, died of wounds from a roadside bomb in northern Iraq.  The three earlier deaths were of a sailor from Brooklyn who died Wednesday in a ''noncombat-related incident'' at Camp Bucca, an American-run detention center in southern Iraq; a marine who died Friday from wounds suffered in combat in Anbar Province; and a soldier who died Friday after being wounded by a roadside bomb in Tikrit, north of Baghdad.  The gun battle in Karbala started when ''an illegally armed militia,'' according to a statement from the American military, attacked the offices of the provincial government in Karbala with guns and grenades.  Brig. Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, deputy commander for Multi-National Division-Baghdad, said American and Iraqi security forces were meeting at the time of the attack to ensure that Shiite pilgrims would be safe during the celebrations later this month for Ashura, one of Shiite Islam's holiest days, which marks the seventh-century martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson, Hussein.  Iraqi state television reported that at least two dozen gunmen assaulted the building, getting inside, and drawing a response from American troops who were dropped by helicopter onto the roof.  Col. Scott Bleichwehl, a military spokesman, said it was not clear who or how many had attacked. By 10 p.m., the building had been secured, he said.  ''It was never lost,'' he said. ''It came under fire from a couple of directions. We responded to it.''  The attack nonetheless seemed to be the latest in a series of power struggles in the south among a patchwork of Shiite tribes and political parties. American officials have been pressing the government of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to set a date for provincial elections, which they said would firmly establish new leaders and possibly reduce the fighting.  Iraqi state television reported that a raid in south Baghdad on Saturday, with around 100 Iraqi police commandos backed by six United States helicopters, killed 15 suspected Sunni Arab insurgents.

            "fulltext": "President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned Wednesday that Iran would not back down from its nuclear ambitions and said his country would soon start producing nuclear fuel on an industrial scale.  ''Iran has the fuel cycle, and very soon we will push the button on nuclear fuel production for industrial uses,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a speech in the southern city of Ghotvand in Khuzestan Province, according to the ISNA news agency.  The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution late last month banning the trade of goods and technology that could benefit Iran's uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missile systems. Enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear weapons or as fuel for nuclear energy plants.  The resolution gave Iran a two-month deadline to suspend its enrichment program, but Iran says that it has the right to enrich uranium as a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  ''The Iranian people will not retreat one iota from their rights,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed Wednesday, adding that Iran would celebrate its nuclear achievements in February, on the 28th anniversary of the victory of the Iranian revolution of 1979.  ''The Iranian people have made their decision to continue this path wisely and will not pay attention to empty cries of the materialists and the bullying of the decadent powers,'' he said.  Other senior officials have also warned that Iran will not surrender in the face of pressure.  Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an influential cleric and the head of the Expediency Council, warned last week that pressing Iran could have consequences.  ''This is a very dangerous resolution,'' he said during Friday Prayer at Tehran University. ''They are creating problems for themselves and the region,'' he said, adding that ''many will suffer from the smoke of this fire.''  One former nuclear negotiator for Iran, Hossein Moussavian, warned the nation's current negotiators on Wednesday that ignoring the resolution and calling it illegal would not help. He said the resolution could have severe consequences for Iran, ISNA reported. ''We can say inside the country that this resolution is illegal, but we have to have a correct understanding of the international community's considerations,'' he was quoted as saying.",

Ayatollah Khamenei, 67, has the final word on state matters, including nuclear policies.  He was making his first public appearance since rumors spread on several Web sites on Thursday that he had died.  ''The Iranian people will definitely not give up their right and the authorities have no right to give up this great achievement,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said, addressing a crowd in Qum, 82 miles south of Tehran.  The Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 with sanctions intended to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes but the United States and some European nations contend is for the purpose of creating nuclear weapons. The measure bars the trade of goods or technology related to Iran's nuclear program. Enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear fuel but also for making nuclear weapons.  The resolution also gave Iran a two-month deadline to halt the program or face tougher sanctions.  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has also brushed off the resolution and vowed that Iran will not suspend the nuclear program.  In his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei also warned neighboring Arab countries not to join an alliance with the United States and Britain against Iran.  ''The nuclear program is a native achievement and is a source of pride for Iran and the Islamic world,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said.  ''If some Arab and Islamic governments think that by joining an alliance with Britain and the United States and imposing sanctions on Iran they can earn the satisfaction of the Zionist regime, they should know that they are making a political blunder,'' he said.",

But she added that ''ultimately it will be substance that dictates when there's a breakthrough.''

In the next few weeks, he is scheduled to visit a group of African countries and make stops in Brussels and Washington. The meetings of about 25 trade ministers in late January during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, are also considered crucial.  Ms. Schwab distanced herself on Friday from the upbeat assessment of Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, who said the talks were approaching ''the endgame.'' She reiterated that an agreement on important issues, like agricultural market access, would dictate whether a deal could be hammered out.  In recent weeks, diplomatic activity and support for a deal at high levels in capitals around the world have lifted hopes that the talks could be revived. The talks, which were started in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001, collapsed in late July because of major differences over agricultural subsidies and tariffs primarily among countries like the United States, the European Union, Japan, India, Australia and Brazil.

Discussions are set to resume Feb. 8 though the United States and North Korea have not settled a dispute over freezing North Korean assets at a bank in Macau, a Chinese territory.  United States Treasury officials and their North Korean counterparts met Tuesday in Beijing to discuss American measures that have led to the freezing of $24 million in North Korean assets held at the bank, Banco Delta Asia. No breakthrough appeared imminent, but the talks were set to continue Wednesday.  The dispute overshadowed the last round of nuclear negotiations, which ended in a stalemate in December. Whether North Korea would bargain on its nuclear program while its money remained frozen was unclear.  The United States contends that the matter is separate from the nuclear issue and that the deposits are linked to North Korean counterfeiting and money laundering.  North Korea exploded a nuclear device in October, adding a sense of urgency to six-nation talks that have dragged on for more than three years without tangible progress.  Many American and Chinese analysts say they doubt North Korea will give up its nuclear arms voluntarily after spending decades working to buy and develop the technology.  But the analysts also say that the Bush administration and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, may have more to gain by continuing the talks than abandoning them, at least partly because China, the key intermediary, insists that the talks are the only way to proceed.  The United States and China agreed to impose limited United Nations military sanctions on North Korea after its nuclear test. But China has opposed tougher penalties on North Korea, its former ally.  Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state and the chief American envoy at the talks, says the North Koreans have signaled their commitment to a 2005 accord on dismantling their arms program. He met his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, in Berlin this month, and both sides said they had set the stage for a productive round.",

            "fulltext": "Iran is barring 38 nuclear agency inspectors from entering the country in retaliation for a United Nations resolution aiming to curb Iran's nuclear program, a senior Iranian lawmaker said Monday.  The announcement came only days after Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, Iran's most senior dissident cleric, criticized President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's defiant stance against the West on the nuclear issue in a speech on Friday, calling it provocative. His comments were the first direct public attack on the president's nuclear policy by such a senior cleric.  The two developments suggest an increasingly open debate within Iran over how forcefully to confront the West over Iran's nuclear ambitions, even as its government continues to defend them.  Two hard-line newspapers, including one owned by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have already called for the president to stay out of all nuclear matters. Ayatollah Montazeri said Iran has the right to nuclear technology but questioned the way Mr. Ahmadinejad has confronted the West.  ''One has to deal with the enemy with wisdom,'' he said. ''We should not provoke the enemy, otherwise the country will be faced with problems.  ''We should get our right in a way that it does not create problems or excuses for others,'' he said.  ''Besides, is this our only irrefutable right and we have no other rights?'' he asked, referring to rising inflation since Mr. Ahmadinejad took office over a year ago.  Ayatollah Montazeri was once in line to become Iran's supreme religious leader, until he was banished and put under house arrest for his criticisms. His comments reflect the growing concern in Iran over additional economic sanctions if Iran continues to defy the international demand to halt its uranium enrichment program.  The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 and imposed sanctions banning the trade of goods related to Iran's nuclear program. It also gave Iran a deadline of two months to halt its uranium enrichment program or face tougher sanctions.  In response, Parliament passed a bill last month calling for the government to limit its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  ''The committee has decided to bar 38 inspectors from coming to Iran and we have announced the new limitation to the agency,'' said Alaedin Boroujerdi, the head of Parliament's committee for foreign policy and national security, the ISNA news agency reported.  The nuclear agency's inspectors visit Iran's nuclear facilities regularly. But last summer Iran said that it had decided not to let some of the inspectors return.  Still, Mr. Boroujerdi said that Iran planned to continue its cooperation with the agency, and that Iran would remain a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  An I.A.E.A. spokeswoman, Melissa Flemming, said that the agency was confident that it could continue to monitor Iran's nuclear program.  ''There are a sufficient number of inspectors designated for Iran, and the I.A.E.A. is able to perform its inspection activities in accordance with Iran's Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement,'' she said in an agency statement.  For his part, Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed again on Sunday that Iran would continue with its nuclear program, and brushed off the United Nations resolution as insignificant.  In Brussels on Monday, European Union foreign ministers called for all countries to enforce the sanctions against Iran. The British foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, said a collective application of the sanctions was essential ''to keep pressure on Iran to accept the offer of the international community to come back to the negotiating table.''  European Union officials said they would apply the measures next month, including a ban on selling materials and technology that could be used in Iran's nuclear and missile programs and the freezing of the assets of 10 Iranian companies and individuals.  Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said it was time to take a tough and united stance on Iran but kept the option of diplomacy open. ''There is a need to send a clear signal, and we need to show resolve,'' he said.  Correction:  January 25, 2007, Thursday  A front-page article on Friday about criticism of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, by Iranian religious authorities over his involvement in the country's nuclear program misstated the connection between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and Jomhouri-Eslami, a newspaper that has rebuked Mr. Ahmadinejad. (The error was repeated in an article about Iran on Tuesday.)

            "fulltext": "China spread alarm and consternation among space powers when it destroyed one of its own satellites last week with a missile fired from the ground, thus becoming the first nation in more than two decades to successfully test an antisatellite weapon. This aggressive show of force puts a wide range of United States military and intelligence satellites at risk and holds the danger of starting an arms race in space. Too bad the Bush administration's own bellicose attitudes -- and adamant refusal to consider an arms control treaty for space -- give it scant standing to chastise the Chinese. The administration needs to reverse course promptly and join in talks aimed at banning further tests or use of antisatellite weapons.  The Chinese test, which Beijing has not acknowledged but was tracked by intelligence agencies, destroyed an aging communications satellite some 500 miles above the Earth. The missile smashed the satellite into hundreds of pieces large enough to pose a danger for a decade or more to spacecraft or satellites that pass through the debris.  The Chinese have now demonstrated that -- should they ever choose -- they could destroy essential American satellites used to conduct military reconnaissance, spot nuclear tests and direct smart weapons. A top intelligence official told reporters last August that China had used a ground-based laser to illuminate an American satellite. That could signal a nascent effort to develop a way to blind satellites or to guide a missile to a target in space.  The Bush administration has been flexing its own muscles in space. A national space policy issued in October declared that ''freedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power.'' It asserted a need to deter others from interfering with America's right to operate in space. The policy did not address whether Washington would place weapons in space -- as some in the Pentagon have been urging -- but the administration continues to oppose any restrictions.  Surely it would make military and diplomatic sense to pursue the opposite course and seek to ban all tests and any use of antisatellite weapons.  The United States and the Soviet Union successfully tested such weapons decades ago and have no overriding need to develop better versions, although the United States is clearly trying. China's success in matching the feat reportedly came after three earlier tests failed, so the Chinese could only benefit from additional testing. The United States, with many more satellites in orbit than any other power and a military that has become increasingly dependent on satellites, has the most to lose from an unbridled space arms race.  Some experts suggest that China's latest test is intended to prod the United States to join serious negotiations. The way to counter China or any other potentially belligerent space power is through an arms control treaty, not a new arms race in space.  Editorial",

            "fulltext": "Seeking to revive stalled negotiations to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the United States held ''substantive'' talks with North Korean diplomats here on Tuesday and Wednesday, said the chief American envoy, Christopher R. Hill.  The unusual one-on-one sessions, the first to be held outside Beijing during the Bush administration, were signs of progress since negotiations broke off in December after North Korea demanded that Washington lift financial sanctions against it.  ''It was a substantive discussion,'' Mr. Hill said in an interview on Wednesday, though he refused to give details. ''The proof of the pudding will be when we all sit down together in the six-party negotiations.''  Mr. Hill briefed Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on his meetings upon her arrival in Germany after a mission through the Middle East and Persian Gulf. Ms. Rice said later that Mr. Hill's discussions ''should help to prepare the way for a more favorable atmosphere at the time of the resumption of the six-party talks, which we would hope would be soon.''  Mr. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, expressed hopes that those broader negotiations -- which would also include China, South Korea, Japan and Russia -- would resume by the end of this month in Beijing, the traditional host for these talks.  An official in the North Korean Embassy here declined to comment on the talks, which are being led on its side by Kim Kye-gwan.  Persuading North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, to abandon his nuclear ambitions has seemed an increasingly hopeless exercise since October, when North Korea tested a nuclear device and declared itself a nuclear state. The most recent talks, American officials said, foundered when the North Korean negotiators proved unyielding on the most basic issues.  Still, the United States was eager to try again, seizing on a visit to Berlin by Mr. Kim to arrange a meeting with Mr. Hill, who was here ostensibly to give a talk at the American Academy in Berlin. American officials appeared encouraged by the tone of the discussions.  North Korea, they noted, was open to talking despite declaring last month that it would not discuss disarmament unless the United States lifted penalties against the Banco Delta Asia in Macao, which held North Korean assets.  The measures, which the United States said it imposed because of North Korea's counterfeiting of American money and laundering of proceeds from drug running, cut off one of the North's valuable channels to international financial markets.  On Wednesday, Russia called on the United States to remove the measures. ''The United States should make some step towards the Koreans by lifting the sanctions,'' the new Russian chief negotiator, Aleksandr Lusyakov, said in an interview with a Russian news agency, RIA.  Treasury officials have held their own negotiations with North Korea to resolve this standoff, and plan to meet again next week, either in Beijing or New York, according to Mr. Hill. But he suggested that the United States did not intend to ease the pressure on North Korea's finances.  ''We've had to make it clear to the North Koreans that as long as they are involved in nuclear weapons production, their international financing will come under scrutiny,'' he said.  Because of the arcane way that Washington and North Korea communicate in their relationship as long-term adversaries and occasional negotiating partners, some brief language in a speech Mr. Hill delivered here Wednesday provoked significant interest.  Mr. Hill issued what some heard as a tantalizing offer that the United States, within the obligations of a 2005 agreement emerging from the six-party talks, looked forward ''to establishing a normal relationship with North Korea.''  ''Obviously this is via a bilateral process, which will take a long time,'' he said.  North Korea has long tried to push the United States into formal bilateral talks, as a means of seeking status and legitimacy as well as to decouple Washington from its regional allies. The United States has insisted that formal talks with North Korea be held only in the six-party format.  Asked to clarify whether the United States was dangling a new relationship before the North Koreans, Ms. Rice said late Wednesday that United States-North Korea ties would have to evolve within the six-party framework, and that Washington was unwavering in demanding a complete and verifiable end to the North's nuclear program.  The 2005 statement signed by the six parties ''envisioned that the denuclearization of the North Korean Peninsula would lead to a bilateral -- a normalization of relations between the United States and the D.P.R.K.,'' Ms. Rice said, using the initials of North Korea's official name.  By engaging North Korea directly, outside China, the United States must tread carefully, a senior official involved in the talks said. American officials informed China of the meeting in Berlin, and Mr. Hill is headed to Beijing, as well as to Seoul and Tokyo, after he leaves Germany.  Though the six-party talks have been held exclusively in Beijing, North Korea has used Berlin as a diplomatic venue in the past, for example during the 1990s for talks with the Clinton administration. It maintains a large embassy here, a legacy of the days of East German Communism.  Ms. Rice landed here after completing meetings with Arab allies in the Middle East and Persian Gulf, and she flew over Iraq en route to Berlin.  Her trip also included talks in Israel and the Palestinian territories, an effort to push ahead stalled peace talks.  During an evening news conference here, Ms. Rice announced that the so-called quartet -- a group of negotiators that includes the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- will meet in Washington in early February to help restart the Middle East talks.",

            "fulltext": "Iran's outspoken president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, appears to be under pressure from the highest authorities in Iran to end his involvement in its nuclear program, a sign that his political capital is declining as his country comes under increasing international pressure.  Just one month after the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Iran to curb its nuclear program, two hard-line newspapers, including one owned by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on the president to stay out of all matters nuclear.  In the hazy world of Iranian politics, such a public rebuke was seen as a sign that the supreme leader -- who has final say on all matters of state -- might no longer support the president as the public face of defiance to the West.  It is the first sign that Mr. Ahmadinejad has lost any degree of Ayatollah Khamenei's confidence, a potentially damaging development for a president who has rallied his nation and defined his administration by declaring nuclear power Iran's ''inalienable right.''  It was unclear, however, whether this was merely an effort to improve Iran's public image by lowering Mr. Ahmadinejad's profile or was signaling a change in policy.  The presidency is a relatively weak position with no official authority over foreign policy, the domain of the supreme leader. But Mr. Ahmadinejad has used his post as a bully pulpit to insert himself into the nuclear debate, and as long as he appeared to enjoy Ayatollah Khamenei's support, he could continue.  While Iran remains publicly defiant, insisting that it will move ahead with its nuclear ambitions, it is under increasing strain as political and economic pressures grow. And the message that Iran's most senior officials seem to be sending is that Mr. Ahmadinejad, with his harsh approach and caustic comments, is undermining Iran's cause and its standing.  The Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 with sanctions intended to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes but the United States and some European nations contend is for the purpose of creating nuclear weapons. The measure bars the trade of goods or technology related to Iran's nuclear program. Enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear fuel but also for making nuclear weapons.  The president dismissed the Security Council resolution as ''a piece of torn paper.''  But the daily Jomhouri-Eslami, which reflects the views of Ayatollah Khamenei, said, ''The resolution is certainly harmful for the country,'' adding that it was ''too much to call it 'a piece of torn paper.' ''  The newspaper added that the nuclear program required its own diplomacy, ''sometimes toughness and sometimes flexibility.''  In another sign of pressure on the president to distance himself from the nuclear issue, a second newspaper, run by an aide to the country's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, also pressed Mr. Ahmadinejad to end his involvement in the nuclear program. Mr. Larijani also ran for president and was selected for his post by the supreme leader.  ''They want to minimize the consequences of sanctions now that they have been imposed,'' said Mohammad Atrianfar, an executive at the daily Shargh, which was closed last fall, and a reformist politician. ''But they don't have clear strategy, and they are taking one step at a time.''  Mr. Ahmadinejad took office more than a year ago as an outsider, the mayor of Tehran who promised to challenge the status quo, to equally distribute Iran's oil wealth and to restore what he saw as the lost values of the Islamic revolution. His was a populist message, centered on a socialist economic model and Islamic values. He found opposition from the right and the left, in Parliament and among so-called pragmatists.  That pressure has continued, and the criticism now seems to have gained more credibility in the face of the sanctions and Iran's troubled economic standing. The United States increased pressure on Iran over its role in Iraq has also raised concerns in Tehran and may be behind efforts to restrain the president, political analysts in Tehran said.  ''The resolution has decreased Iran's political credibility in the international community, and so other countries cannot defend Iran,'' said Ahmad Shirzad, a reformist politician and a former legislator.  Although the Security Council sanctions were limited to Iran's nuclear program, they have started to cause economic disruptions.  About 50 legislators signed a letter this week calling on the president to appear before Parliament to answer questions about the nuclear program. They need at least 22 more signatures.  In another letter, 150 lawmakers criticized the president for his economic policies, which have led to a surge in inflation, and for his failure to submit his annual budget on time.  The Iranian stock market, which was already in a slump, continued to decline -- falling more rapidly in the past month -- as buyers stayed away from the market. The daily Kargozaran reported last week that the number of traders had decreased by 46 percent since the Security Council resolution was passed.  ''The resolution has had a psychological effect on people,'' said Ali Hagh, an economist in Tehran. ''It does not make sense for investors not to consider political events when they want to invest their money.''  Kargozaran reported that a group of powerful businessmen, the Islamic Coalition Party, met with Mohammad Nahavandian, a senior official at the Supreme National Security Council, and called for moderation in the country's nuclear policies to prevent further damage to the economy.  In the past year, several major European banks have severed their business ties with Iran. Economists say the banks' actions will also lead to an increase in inflation because importers must turn to complicated ways to finance purchases.  ''The nuclear issue has paved the way for other forms of pressures on Iran,'' Mr. Shirzad said.  Despite Mr. Ahmadinejad's harsh language since the resolution was passed, Ayatollah Khamenei has not referred to it directly and only once said that Iran would not give up its right to pursue its nuclear program.  Mr. Larijani has said that Iran will not quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or bar international inspectors despite earlier threats to do so.  Correction:  January 25, 2007, Thursday  A front-page article on Friday about criticism of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, by Iranian religious authorities over his involvement in the country's nuclear program misstated the connection between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and Jomhouri-Eslami, a newspaper that has rebuked Mr. Ahmadinejad.

            "fulltext": "The head of the United Nations nuclear inspection agency said Friday that Iranian officials had told him that they planned to begin installing equipment next month in an industrial-scale plant to enrich uranium.  Such a move would intensify Iran's confrontation with the Security Council, which has demanded a full suspension of the production of nuclear material, and has authorized mild sanctions.  The announcement by the official, Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, was coupled with a plea to both Tehran and Western nations for all sides to take a ''timeout'' to head off a larger confrontation.  ''Enough flexing muscles, enough calling names,'' Dr. ElBaradei said in a conversation with reporters here at the World Economic Forum conference. ''It's time to engage.''  He proposed a suspension of the sanctions against Iran, while the Iranians simultaneously suspend enrichment of uranium. That process can produce fuel for nuclear weapons, though the Iranians deny that is their goal.  Nuclear experts and American officials say Iran's announcement may be a bluff. Tehran has run into significant difficulties in assembling centrifuges to enrich uranium. A year ago it promised to have 3,000 centrifuges running by now; instead, it is just beginning to install that equipment, at Natanz.  But Dr. ElBaradei seemed clearly concerned that once enrichment began, it would be difficult to halt, and that Iranian officials would be loath to dismantle any plant once construction had begun.  He is also concerned that such a plant could become a military target for the United States or Israel. Such a strike would be ''absolutely bonkers,'' he said, noting that it would not deprive Iran of the technological expertise to pursue any nuclear ambitions.  ''It would only strengthen the hand of hard-liners,'' he said. ''They would simply go underground.''  Dr. ElBaradei said he worried that further sanctions against Iran, which the United Nations has threatened to impose next month, ''is only going to lead to an escalation.''  Given what inspectors know about Iran's current capabilities, Dr. ElBaradei said, the Iranians are three to eight years away from being able to manufacture a nuclear device. That is roughly in line with estimates made by American intelligence officials.  The United States said it would stick to its insistence that Iran stop enrichment before negotiations begin. The State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said the reports that Iran planned to install 3,000 centrifuges showed its continued defiance.  ''We'll see what Dr. ElBaradei has to say,'' Mr. McCormack said Friday at a briefing in Washington. ''More importantly, we'll see what the Iranians do; they continue in provocative behavior.''  He said the preliminary sanctions, which ban the import and export of material used in uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missiles, appeared to be having some effect in Iran.  There is evidence of an internal split in Tehran. Two hard-line newspapers that reflect the views of Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recently demanded that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stay away from nuclear issues because his comments were deepening Iran's isolation.  Iran's relations with the international nuclear monitoring agency have deteriorated since the sanctions were approved. Iran has demanded the agency remove the official who oversees inspections of Iranian facilities, and it has barred more than 30 inspectors, all from countries that supported sanctions.  It is not clear how much influence Dr. ElBaradei can exercise, now that the confrontation has moved to the Security Council. But he appears to believe there is support for his proposal.  A diplomat at the agency, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had found such support in Germany and France. Those nations, along with Britain, have led the talks with Iran over its nuclear program.  Dr. ElBaradei has also consulted with Russia, which favors a more conciliatory approach. But he did not discuss the idea with American officials before making it public here, the diplomat said.  The United States has said that if Iran suspended uranium enrichment, Washington would join the Europeans in direct talks with Tehran, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has indicated that she would take part.  Dr. ElBaradei also suggested the United States show more flexibility in its standoff with North Korea, which detonated a crude nuclear device in October. The North Koreans have demanded that the United States drop financial sanctions as a condition for reviving talks over their nuclear program.  American and North Korean officials met this month in Berlin, a meeting meant to lay the groundwork for a revival of multiparty talks in Beijing. State Department officials say they are hopeful of some kind of deal, perhaps involving a temporary freeze on plutonium production in the North.",

            "fulltext": "The United States, moving to raise pressure on Iran, on Tuesday barred American financial institutions from doing business with a major Iranian bank after concluding that it had been involved in illicit weapons programs.  The move against Bank Sepah, announced by the Treasury Department, also affected North Korea, which American officials said had used the bank to facilitate payments to a North Korean group that exports missile technologies.  The announcement applies to domestic and foreign branches of American banks, as well as to American citizens working at overseas banks that deal with Bank Sepah anywhere in the world. The department also said that no American bank can transfer dollars to Bank Sepah or its branches and subsidiaries in Rome, London, Frankfurt and Paris.  The Treasury announcement was the second time in the last year that a major Iranian bank had been barred from any dealings with the American financial system. It is the first specific move against an Iranian bank since the imposition of sanctions on Iran by the United Nations Security Council on Dec. 23.  Last year, the United States took similar action against Bank Saderat, another of Iran's major institutions, citing what it said was the bank's involvement in financing terrorism. Both Bank Saderat and Bank Sepah, cited for financial transactions linked to weapons proliferation, are state owned or controlled.  Though the two banks have virtually no direct links to American banks, the designation means that no American bank can help facilitate -- by transferring dollars, for example -- any transaction between a European bank and Bank Sepah. Thus if an Italian or German bank wanted to supply dollars for a transaction involving Bank Sepah, it would be unable to do so because American banks would be barred from transferring them.  American experts say these steps effectively extend the reach of American law to other countries, though to only a limited degree.  ''By taking this action, the United States is putting immense pressure on our allies and trading partners to treat Bank Sepah the same way we do,'' said Judith Lee, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher specializing in sanctions law. ''It is an effort to make U.S. actions against Iran extraterritorial.''  European countries have opposed moves by the United States to apply the principle of extraterritoriality, a term referring to cases when American law can affect dealings entirely within another country. But the Bush administration recently has stepped up its use of various laws and directives to press forward with the concept.  For example, since oil is traded in dollars, the reach of American directives could be significant, many banking experts say. In theory, Tuesday's action would prevent Bank Sepah from facilitating an oil sale in which dollars are used. Iran has already announced that, because of American directives, it has begun selling oil for euros rather than dollars.  ''Bank Sepah is the financial linchpin of Iran's missile procurement network, and has actively assisted Iran's pursuit of missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction,'' said Stuart Levey, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.  Mr. Levey said Bank Sepah had been involved in transactions for Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization and two Iranian missile companies. These three entities were mentioned in the Security Council resolution approved in late December calling on all countries to avoid doing business with various groups in Iran.  Mr. Levey also said the United States had been in touch with authorities in Britain, France, Italy and Germany to discuss the need to persuade local financial institutions to stop doing business with Bank Sepah.  Unlike the United States, Mr. Levey said that European countries, which have not enacted laws like those passed here, ''don't have specific authority to act as the United States does'' against European banks or businesses engaging in transactions with other banks and businesses linked to terrorism or weapons programs.  Nevertheless, Treasury officials say Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Mr. Levey have pressed European authorities and banks to try to isolate both Bank Sepah and Bank Saderat.  Mr. Levey said that the branch of Bank Sepah in Rome had had significant involvement in financial transactions related to Iran's missile program, and that Italian authorities had been alerted to the problem.  There was no immediate comment from the press office of the Italian Embassy in Washington on whether Italy was taking any separate actions in consonance with the United States actions.  When the United States moved against Bank Saderat last year, many banking experts predicted that it was only a matter of time before Washington took action against other financial institutions in Iran.  American officials say already intensive diplomacy has been stepped up after the Security Council resolution adopted in late December as part of a campaign to get Iran to stop enriching uranium in what the West has charged is a clandestine nuclear weapons program.  That resolution ended up being weakened at the request of Russia and China, and some American officials say they need to shift tactics and use other means to exert financial pressure on Iran.",

            "fulltext": "THE higher math of hanging pictures has always escaped me. The measurements of the space on one wall and two or four or seven pictures require a kind of visual algebra that I have no aptitude for.  There are rules, I know, but I can never quite remember them -- do you line up the frames from the bottom or from the top? They should be hung at eye level, I know, but whose eye? And should they be grouped or evenly spaced? Determining the correct amount of space between the pictures throws the calculations into ever greater confusion.  And then there are the structural issues of where to hang the hook. Once the most you could do was knock on the wall; when the sound changed, you knew you had hit on something solid -- with any luck, a stud that could support a nail and whatever was going to hang on it. If your house happens to conform to current construction standards, the studs are generally centered 16 inches apart, which makes it easy to determine where the supports are.  But if you still don't know, there are tools to help you. There is the stud finder, an electronic device outfitted with circuitry that is capable of detecting changes in material behind the surface it passes over; run it across a wall, and it beeps when it detects a stud.  Once the stud finder has located the studs in the wall, you can then use a laser level, a battery-operated device that shines a thin beam of light along the wall, eliminating the need to draw a line in pencil or otherwise mark the wall.  When it comes to the hanging itself, I had always thought traditional picture hangers to be sufficient. Even more dependable, I now learn, is the Hercules Hook, whose breathless ads on cable TV promise that it has the muscle to hang and hold up to 150 pounds. The hook has a curved rod of reinforced steel, sharpened at one end, that can simply be twisted, pushed and turned into the wall. Its curved form allows it to brace itself on the back of the wall, and it punctures the wall with surgical precision, leaving nothing but a pin-sized hole.  Despite having such tools available to me, when I finally faced the labored calculus of aligning the pictures and determining their appropriate proximity, I knew I was still without the most important tool of all, which was the intuition essential for such an endeavor. I called upon my friend and neighbor Myron Adams to help me. He has an instinctive knowledge about such things, some innate grasp of where things belong.  When I asked him how he came by this skill, he told me that his father, an architect, knew where everything was supposed to go. ''It seemed a little totalitarian,'' he said, ''but, in fact, it was very instructive.'' And as a teenager, Myron had once worked for an artist who hung her own paintings. ''She had no rules or tricks,'' he said. ''She was just a classy lady who knew how to eyeball things.'' Which, it occurred to me, would be a nice way to be remembered, and I became all the more determined to get the hang of it.  What with stud finders and Hercules Hooks, you might think hanging pictures is a high-testosterone enterprise that requires some kind of manly heft. That was not my experience. A different kind of stamina was called for, I found. Because for all the exacting tools at hand, it still remained an imprecise exercise. The calculations were made even more elusive by the fact that these were pictures of my family -- an old portrait of my great-great-grandmother Frances, who gazed down at us sternly across the distance the years have conferred on her; a watercolor of my mother that captured the tentativeness of her teenage years; and pastels of my sons when they were 10, staring out of their frames with the cheerful defiance that comes so naturally to young boys.  And then there was the question of those frames. Surrounding Frances is a heavy gilt frame with elaborate scrollwork; the portrait has a weight that might actually justify a Hercules Hook, if its name didn't seem like such an affront to her 19th-century reserve. A simple wood frame is around my mother, and with the boys the frames are more casual still. But for Myron, such visual inconsistency is cause for delight, just another sign of the generational disparity that makes life interesting. Almost effortlessly he managed to find a place on the wall for all of the portraits.  None of the subjects ever knew each other. My mother died long before her grandsons were born, so this is as close as they will ever come to being introduced. But with help from a stud finder, a laser level, a hammer and a handful of nails, they manage to keep company now on this 8-by-12-foot patch of blue wall. My mother and her grandsons are only inches apart from each other, and Frances, slightly above, presides over them, kind of classy in her own way and, for sure, eyeballing us all.  Still, there are no right angles in my old house, and none of the walls are plumb, so no matter how we tried to coerce order among these pictures, the grouping still seemed a little awry. Despite the arsenal of tools that promised absolute precision, nothing has quite managed to line up. At best, the portraits just kind of float contentedly in their improvisational closeness in the never-ending exercise of a family, probably any family, trying to find the order among its members.  I often step back and look at this gathering on the wall. There is no big picture, just as there are no strict rules about how a family composes itself. All of which, I suppose, is as it should be. Arranging these pictures on the wall was just another reminder of how difficult it is to understand the space between us; and how it is so rarely what we imagine or hope for.  HOME WORK",

So it has fallen to the rest of the Colts to guess how Manning will be judged after Sunday's game against the Patriots.  Manning, for all his regular-season success and stratospheric statistics, is in an unenviable position. He is constantly compared to Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who is 12-1 in the postseason, even if he is no threat to break the passing records that Manning will set.  Manning will almost certainly own every passing record before he retires, but he is 5-6 in playoff games and is in danger of inching into Dan Marino's shoes as the best quarterback to never have won a Super Bowl.  In a conference call earlier this week, the former Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason said that if the Colts lose Sunday, Manning will be lumped into the same category as the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez: players who make the most money, but haven't won championships.  Colts Coach Tony Dungy arrived in Pittsburgh as a defensive back when Terry Bradshaw was winning Super Bowls for the Steelers, but he remembers when the jury was still out on Bradshaw. Manning, after nine years in the N.F.L., may be only halfway through his career.  \"I don't think you judge him until his career is over,\" Dungy said.",

No team with a record as bad as the Saints' 3-13 last season had ever made the conference championship the next season. But here are the Saints, and, tailback Deuce McAllister said, ''This may be destiny.''  It may be many things, but two stand out:  Can the Bears' celebrated defense rise from the doldrums and handle McAllister, quarterback Drew Brees, the all-around threat Reggie Bush and those dangerous receivers?  Which Rex Grossman will show up at quarterback for the Bears?  Last week, Grossman was mostly good in an overtime victory against the Seahawks, and the Saints' secondary has been vulnerable to the long pass. Grossman was erratic during the regular season, with 23 touchdown passes and 20 interceptions. ''What's important is those players have a belief in him,'' Saints Coach Sean Payton said.  Although the Bears' defense has lost some of its dominance because of injuries, linebacker Lance Briggs said, ''We tweak a little, we're right back where we were.''  The Bears will have an advantage from a home crowd, and Chicago weather in January can be shocking to a dome team from a warm-weather city.

They beat the Patriots 11 weeks ago, when Brady threw four interceptions, and he threw three last week against the Chargers.

            "fulltext": "In trying to create a brighter future for quarterback Eli Manning, Giants Coach Tom Coughlin continues to reach into his own past.  In 1997, Coughlin, then the coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, hired Chris Palmer as his offensive coordinator. Palmer replaced Kevin Gilbride, who had taken the head-coaching position with the San Diego Chargers.  Coughlin has made a similar move now, hiring Palmer as the Giants' quarterbacks coach to replace Gilbride, who was elevated to offensive coordinator. An announcement is expected today.  Palmer, 57, spent last season as the quarterbacks coach for the Dallas Cowboys, who changed to the inexperienced quarterback Tony Romo from the veteran Drew Bledsoe at midseason, with good results.  Palmer was the offensive coordinator of the Jaguars in 1997 and 1998. In 1997, Mark Brunell led the American Football Conference in passer rating and was named to the Pro Bowl.  In 1999, Palmer became the coach of the expansion Cleveland Browns. He was fired after two seasons; quarterback Tim Couch, chosen with the first overall pick in the 1999 draft, struggled to live up to expectations.  From 2002 to 2005, Palmer was the offensive coordinator of the Houston Texans, helping develop another No. 1 overall pick, quarterback David Carr.  The tie between Palmer and Gilbride runs deep. Each played quarterback at Southern Connecticut State -- Palmer graduated in 1972, two years before Gilbride. Both are in the university's Sports Hall of Fame.  Palmer's first coaching experience in the N.F.L. was as the receivers coach for the Houston Oilers from 1990 to 1992. Gilbride was the team's offensive coordinator.  The Giants were 8-8 in 2006 and lost six of their final eight regular-season games. They made the National Football Conference playoffs as a wild-card team, but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round.  Before the final regular-season game, Coughlin stripped the offensive coordinator John Hufnagel of his responsibilities and handed them to Gilbride.  Manning, the first choice in the 2004 draft, was inconsistent most of the season and showed few signs of progress from the previous season.  ''I've only had one quarterbacks coach in the N.F.L.,'' Manning said during a conference call Thursday when asked about his ideal coach. ''I'm just looking for someone who's obviously smart, intelligent. Someone who we can have a good relationship and just really communicate well together and be on the same page with things. Someone who has good drills and is going to be hard on me and coach me and make sure that everything that I'm doing, I'm doing to get better.''  PRO FOOTBALL",

No team in the N.F.L. forced more turnovers (44) than the Bears during the regular season, and their ball-hawking style has continued during the playoffs. During their 39-14 victory against the New Orleans Saints in the National Football Conference championship game, the Bears produced four turnovers -- three fumble recoveries and an interception.  The Indianapolis Colts have not lost a fumble in three postseason games, but Peyton Manning has thrown six interceptions. If the Bears can force takeaways against Manning and the Colts' offense, Chicago likes its chances.  ''Get the ball out of their hands, any way possible,'' Bears linebacker Lance Briggs said Monday when asked about his team's season-long approach to defense. ''It's preached. If we go in the meeting room to look on film, and we're not running in to get the ball out, we're going to hear about it all day.''  SUPPORT FOR ROONEY RULE -- Bears Coach Lovie Smith remains a supporter of the Rooney rule, which requires N.F.L. teams to interview a minority candidate for every head-coaching opportunity. Smith and Tony Dungy of the Colts are the first African-American coaches to reach the Super Bowl, and 6 of the league's 32 teams have an African-American head coach. The Cowboys are still seeking a coach to replace Bill Parcells, who retired last week.  Last week, the Pittsburgh Steelers hired their first African-American coach, Mike Tomlin. Smith used that example to support the Rooney rule.  ''I would like to think owners would hire the best coach, but I'm here because of the Rooney rule,'' Smith said. He added: ''It's good that guys like Mike Tomlin have gotten an opportunity to be a head football coach. I think Mike would have gotten an opportunity still, but I think it may speed up the process a little bit. Whenever you can get in front of someone is good, and of course the Rooney rule allows you that opportunity.''  IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME -- Bears defensive end Adewale Ogunleye is enjoying the Super Bowl experience because he lives in Miami during the off-season. After the Bears arrived in Miami on Sunday, he went home.  Ogunleye also acted as a tour guide Sunday night, taking some of his teammates out on the town.  ''That was the only night that we're going to be able to do that,'' Ogunleye said. '' I had most of the guys on the team there, most of the single guys. I don't want to get the married guys in trouble.''  SINGLETARY TO INTERVIEW IN DALLAS -- Mike Singletary, a Hall of Fame linebacker, will be interviewed Tuesday for the Cowboys' coaching job. Singletary will meet with Jerry Jones, the team's owner, as the eighth candidate considered to replace Bill Parcells. (AP)  AROUND THE LEAGUE -- Chris Palmer was hired as the quarterbacks coach of the Giants.  The Raiders hired the former Atlanta offensive coordinator Greg Knapp to fill the same job in Oakland.

            "fulltext": "Harassing Peyton Manning with a consistent pass rush is a top priority for the New England Patriots.  The Patriots sacked Manning three times during their regular-season game Nov. 5, but the Colts still won, 27-20, as Manning threw for 326 yards and 2 touchdowns. Looking at game film in preparation for Sunday's American Football Conference championship game against Indianapolis only reinforced what the Patriots already knew: The more time they give Manning to throw, the harder it will be to contain him.  ''We looked at that game, and you look back and think, 'Well, I didn't rush that bad personally and neither did anybody else,' '' Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel said earlier this week.  ''Then you say, 'Well, his numbers were still pretty good.' You've just got to do more. You've got to get there quicker, whether you're rushing or whether you're covering. This is a game where you're just going to have to do more and you're just going to have to play better.''  On several plays in November's game, Manning made throws from outside the pocket, running away from pressure to buy more time. Manning is not known for his scrambling ability, so the Patriots say they want to be more disciplined when they rush to prevent Manning from getting away.  ''You always think of Peyton Manning as a pocket passer, which he is, but he does have the ability to get outside the pocket and can make plays on the run,'' New England defensive end Richard Seymour said. ''His ability to ad-lib and their receivers just staying alive is something that we have to be aware of.''  All the Patriots who had been ailing with the flu practiced Friday: wide receiver Troy Brown, linebacker Tedy Bruschi, offensive tackle Ryan O'Callaghan and defensive tackle Mike Wright.  Safety Rodney Harrison, who missed the Patriots' first two playoff games with a knee injury, also practiced, but his status for the game remained uncertain.  PANTHERS HIRE LEWIS -- Carolina hired Tim Lewis, the Giants' former defensive coordinator, as its new secondary coach. Lewis, who was fired by the Giants last week, replaced Rod Perry, who was fired Monday. The Giants' defense struggled this season, allowing an average of 342 yards a game.  ''Our staff is familiar with him, and we think he will make a strong contribution to our defense,'' Panthers Coach John Fox said.

            "fulltext": "After the New England Patriots throttled the Jets on Sunday, 37-16, someone asked Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi if the Patriots took their game to another level during the playoffs.  ''The next level to us is the Super Bowl,'' he said. ''And we haven't been there in a while.''  A while? The Patriots won their most recent Super Bowl title two seasons ago. Only one championship has been decided since then, and it went to the Pittsburgh Steelers.  ''That's a while to me,'' Bruschi said.  So it is these days in New England, where a trip to the Super Bowl is a rite of winter. But this winter will be a bit longer for the Patriots if they are to reach their fourth Super Bowl in six seasons. In their three title runs, they did not have to take the long way. The Patriots had first-round byes and needed only two victories, the first at home, to make it to the Super Bowl.  Last season, when the Patriots had to play a first-round game, they beat the Jaguars. The next week, they lost to the Broncos in Denver, 27-13. Of course, the Steelers won the Super Bowl after winning three playoff games on the road.  The Patriots were 12-4 this season, but that earned them only the fourth seeding in the American Football Conference. And their victory over the Jets set up a meeting with the San Diego Chargers, an opponent that no team wants. The Chargers have a 10-game winning streak and are unbeaten at home. The Patriots, as the lowest-seeded team remaining, cannot be the host for the A.F.C. championship game.  The Patriots were 7-1 on the road, with their only loss a 21-0 shocker at Miami.  But none of their previous road opponents had the offensive firepower that the Chargers possess. The game presents excellent matchups. The up-and-coming quarterback Philip Rivers against Tom Brady, the best playoff quarterback in the game. Brady will also go against one of the best pass rushers in the game, Shawne Merriman. Chargers tight end Antonio Gates matches against whatever combination of defenders have to chase him.  The biggest matchup will be the Patriots' front seven, the best in the league, against Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson, the N.F.L.'s most valuable player. Tomlinson, who was also named offensive player of the year, rushed for 1,815 yards and 28 touchdowns this season.  ''He's explosive,'' cornerback Asante Samuel said of Tomlinson. ''If you sit back, he'll gas you like he does everyone else.''  Chargers Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who has notably failed in previous postseasons, goes up against Bill Belichick, perhaps the best coach of his era. Still, this is the most balanced team Schottenheimer has ever had, and he has said that Tomlinson is the best running back ever to play in the league. Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork called the Chargers ''hands-down the best team in the N.F.L.''  Tomlinson has faced the Patriots only three times since he came into the league in 2001, but he has turned in memorable performances, averaging 141.7 yards. In 2002, he ran for 217 yards and 2 touchdowns. Last season, he had 134 yards and 2 touchdowns as the Chargers scored 24 unanswered points in the second half to win, 41-17. Samuel remembered feeling as if a professional team were playing a college team in that game, with a sense of hopelessness that the Patriots rarely have.  ''He killed us last year,'' Belichick said Monday. ''We're usually looking at the back of his jersey. We haven't done very well against him. He's killed a lot of people besides us, and he's killed us. A team might keep him down for a few carries, but it's just a matter of time before he breaks out, in one way or another, and gets in the end zone.''  The Patriots had the fifth-best run defense in the league this season (they were 12th against the pass and 6th over all), but the perception is that the Patriots lack tremendous speed among their linebackers, a potential liability against Tomlinson. The Jets, who did not have much of a running game, used the speedy Leon Washington to slash through the Patriots' defense. He averaged 4.5 yards while being defended by Bruschi, although he had only 11 carries.  Safety Rodney Harrison, who is critical to holding off a multipronged offensive attack, missed the game against the Jets because of a right knee injury sustained in the regular-season finale against the Titans. On Monday, Belichick said Harrison was day to day and would not say if he would be available Sunday.  In their most successful seasons, the Patriots relied on Harrison in the playoffs to disrupt an explosive offense -- usually that of the Colts and Peyton Manning -- with his hard hits and intensity. Manning and the Colts play the Ravens on Saturday in Baltimore. On Sunday, perhaps without Harrison, New England again faces the most dangerous offensive player, this time in Tomlinson.

            "fulltext": "Part of the deal that allowed Giants Coach Tom Coughlin to keep his job was the promise to the team's owners that he would make changes. The status quo, following an 8-8 record and a first-round playoff exit, was not good enough.  On Wednesday, the Giants accepted the promise by retaining Coughlin for at least one more season. Yesterday, Coughlin made his first major off-season change: He fired his defensive coordinator, Tim Lewis.  Coughlin will enter his fourth season with the Giants without the two coordinators who started with him in 2004. Coughlin removed the offensive coordinator, John Hufnagel, in the final week of the regular season.  Coughlin declined comment on his decision to remove Lewis, who built powerful defenses with the Pittsburgh Steelers and was the first assistant coach to join Coughlin in 2004. Lewis is a frequent head-coaching candidate and was interviewed this week by the Miami Dolphins, who are looking to replace Nick Saban.  But Lewis, 45, a man with an easy smile and an air of grace, could not create a fearsome defense with the Giants. A below-average unit in 2005, it was overhauled in the off-season, with six new starters for the 2006 opener, but sputtered at midseason, worn thin by injuries.  The Giants allowed 362 points, ranking 24th among the N.F.L.'s 32 teams. The defense ranked 25th in total defense, measured by yards allowed. It was 14th in rushing yards allowed and 28th in passing yards.  In 2005, the Giants were 24th in total defense -- 12th against the run and 27th against the pass.  One logical candidate to replace Lewis is Dom Capers, the former Panthers and Texans coach who spent last season as the defensive coordinator for the Dolphins. Capers, who has interviewed for the Dolphins' head-coaching position, was Coughlin's defensive coordinator with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1999 and 2000.  Coughlin has made no other coaching moves, but the other defensive assistants are in limbo. A new coordinator would probably create his own staff.  The firing of Lewis is a clear signal that the Giants of 2007, while remaining under the control of Coughlin, will be markedly different than the 2006 version.  Coughlin stripped Hufnagel of his responsibilities just five days before the final game of the regular season, handing them to the quarterbacks coach Kevin Gilbride. Hufnagel left the team a few days later.  Coughlin has not given Gilbride the title of offensive coordinator, but he will have at least one offensive assistant to hire, either a coordinator or a quarterbacks coach, as the Giants try to kick-start quarterback Eli Manning's progress.  While Hufnagel was the first to lose his job because of the disappointing season, it appears sweeping changes will be made to the defense, which struggled with injuries and consistency the past two seasons.  The Giants were ranked 10th in total defense after the Nov. 12 game against the Chicago Bears. But a quick rash of injuries near midseason seemed to unravel the unit. In particular, a promising rush defense went soft and a once-rabid pass rush turned benign.  After losing linebacker LaVar Arrington for the season in late October, the Giants lost the seven-time Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan to a foot sprain. Defensive end Osi Umenyiora, who had 14 1/2 sacks and made the Pro Bowl in 2005, missed five games. Cornerback Sam Madison missed several games, returning just as the other starting cornerback, Corey Webster, went down.  The Giants allowed 144 points in the first eight games (an average of 18.0), and 218 in the last eight (27.3). The Giants went 2-6 to finish the season and barely slid into the playoffs.  The Giants ended the season ranked 24th in stopping teams on third down, 25th in first downs allowed, and 26th in sacks per pass play.  In 2005, when the Giants were 11-5 and won the division, the defense faltered late in the season, largely because of a series of injuries to the linebackers.  That drove the Giants to make several defensive changes, while leaving the offense's starting lineup intact. They added three starters through free agency: Arrington, safety Will Demps and Madison. They started their fourth-round draft choice, Barry Cofield, at defensive tackle, and elevated the reserves Webster and Fred Robbins, a defensive tackle, to the starting lineup.  More changes are certain for next season, particularly at linebacker and cornerback. But the biggest change will be the coordinator.  Lewis, a cornerback, played at the University of Pittsburgh. He was chosen by the Green Bay Packers with the 11th overall choice in the 1983 N.F.L. draft, but a neck injury in his fourth season ended his career.  Lewis spent nine seasons as an assistant with the Steelers, the last four -- 2000 to 2003 -- as defensive coordinator before he was dismissed by Coach Bill Cowher. The 2001 defense was ranked first in the league, and his other units finished in the top 10.  Lewis could not replicate that success with the Giants. And when the Giants decided that Coughlin would stay, it was obvious that others would go.  PRO FOOTBALL",

Steve Spagnuolo, the Eagles' linebackers coach and a defensive assistant for the team for eight years, was hired yesterday to replace the fired Tim Lewis. In Philadelphia, Spagnuolo coached defensive backs Brian Dawkins, Bobby Taylor and Troy Vincent for three years and linebacker Jeremiah Trotter for the past three. All have been Pro Bowl players.  Expecting to rely on their defense in 2006, the Giants suffered from serious injuries to defensive ends Michael Strahan and Osi Umenyiora and linebacker LaVar Arrington, and often-erratic play by others. In the second half of the season, they lost four games in which they led or were tied in the fourth quarter.  Four days after their playoff loss to the Eagles, the Giants fired Lewis, their defensive coordinator for the past three seasons. In a teleconference yesterday, Coach Tom Coughlin said he had researched many potential successors but had interviewed only Spagnuolo.  Coughlin spoke from Mobile, Ala., where he is monitoring daily practice sessions for the Senior Bowl. He said he was impressed by Spagnuolo's achievements with the Eagles.  ''I was looking for a guy who had an opportunity to work with outstanding people in the league,'' Coughlin said, ''not just an aggressive system, because the system here has been aggressive. It is a plus that he knows our division, and is also a plus that he comes from a program that has Andy Reid as a head coach and Jim Johnson as a defensive coordinator.''  Spagnuolo, 47, played wide receiver at Springfield (Mass.) College. He graduated in 1981 and started his coaching career a year later.  He joined the Eagles in 1999 as a defensive assistant/quality control coach. Before that, he was the defensive coordinator at Massachusetts and at Maine and an intern, scout, personnel aide and assistant coach for more than a half-dozen college and professional teams.  This season, the Giants' defense allowed 342.4 yards a game, eighth most in the N.F.L. The Eagles allowed 328.1, but their reliance on blitzing helped them to a 10-6 record. In the playoffs, they defeated the Giants on a last-play field goal, then lost to the New Orleans Saints.  The Giants finished with an 8-8 record and a need for defensive changes. Coughlin, however, said all of the assistant coaches on defense would remain. He said Spagnuolo's defense would be based on personnel rather than philosophies, and that seemed fine with Spagnuolo.  In the same conference call, Spagnuolo said: ''You've seen the Giants against the Eagles the last two years, and that's the bulk of what I want to do. It may be a slight advantage facing the Eagles, but I don't know if that is going to make a difference between winning and losing. I may know what they're going to do, but I don't know what they're going to do on that play.''  PRO FOOTBALL",

            "fulltext": "Patriots Put a Stop to the Titans' Run  Corey Dillon ran for two touchdowns and Tom Brady threw for one as the Patriots defeated the Titans, 40-23, dashing Tennessee's hopes for a playoff spot. The host Titans (8-8) had won six games in a row and needed to beat the Patriots and hope the Jaguars, Bengals and Broncos lost. All three did, but the Titans proved no match for the Patriots (12-4), who will play the Jets in a wild-card game Sunday.  With New Orleans (10-6) set to play host to its first playoff game in the rebuilt Superdome in two weeks, Coach Sean Payton removed several key players early in the Saints' 31-21 loss to the visiting Panthers. Quarterback Drew Brees played only one full series and was 4 of 5 for 46 yards. Reggie Bush rushed for an early touchdown but played little more than a quarter, and running back Deuce McAllister had the day off. Carolina finished 8-8.  Shaun Alexander rushed for 92 yards and scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter as the Seahawks defeated the Buccaneers, 23-7. Visiting Seattle (9-7) had little to play for after clinching the National Football Conference West title; they will play host to Dallas in the first round Saturday. Tampa Bay finished 4-12.  Chargers and Ravens Finish 1-2 in A.F.C.  Philip Rivers threw two touchdown passes after spraining his right foot, and LaDainian Tomlinson also limped off after wrapping up his first rushing title as the Chargers defeated the visiting Cardinals, 27-20. The Chargers (14-2), who have won 10 in a row, clinched home-field advantage throughout the American Football Conference playoffs. Rivers and Tomlinson, who had one of his legs stepped on, said they would have played if the result had been more important, but the Chargers had already earned a first-round bye. Tomlinson ran for 66 yards, giving him 1,815 this season. Arizona finished 5-11.  Using a stellar performance from the defense and an efficient effort from the offense, the Ravens beat the Bills, 19-7, to earn the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C. Chris McAlister returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown and the host Ravens (13-3) allowed only 39 yards rushing. Buffalo finished 7-9.  Colts Finish Strong, but Cowboys Do Not  Peyton Manning threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score as the Colts held on to beat the visiting Dolphins, 27-22. Manning's two scoring passes gave him 275 in his career, moving him ahead of Joe Montana into seventh on the career list. Indianapolis (12-4), which blew a chance to earn a first-round bye by losing four times in the previous six weeks, will play host to Kansas City in a wild-card game Saturday. Cleo Lemon was solid in his first N.F.L. start for Miami (6-10), finishing 18 of 36 for 210 yards.  Done in by repeated mistakes from quarterback Tony Romo and a few more by cornerback Terence Newman, the Cowboys lost To the visiting Lions, 39-31, and blew their chance to stay alive in the N.F.C. East race. ''I can't tell you how disappointed I am, I really can't,'' Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells said. As much as Dallas (9-7) wanted to win the game, Detroit (3-13) might have been better off losing it. By winning, they gave the Raiders the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. But even the Lions could not refuse the gifts the Cowboys gave them, from a penalty on Newman that wiped out an interception return for a touchdown on the game's first snap to Romo's two fumbles and an interception.  In Other Games  Steven Jackson had a career-high 4 touchdowns and 142 yards rushing, helping the visiting Rams defeat the Vikings, 41-21. Jackson's 59-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter prevented Minnesota (6-10) from establishing a postmerger N.F.L. record for fewest yards rushing allowed in a season. They missed by 15 the mark of 970 yards set by the Ravens in 2000. The Rams finished 8-8.  Despite losing running back Ron Dayne (ankle) and tight end Jeb Putzier (broken foot) to injuries in pregame warm-ups, the Texans defeated the visiting Browns, 14-6. Houston (6-10) won back-to-back games for the first time since 2004 and tripled its victory total from last season. Cleveland finished 4-12.  PRO FOOTBALL",

            "fulltext": "Brian Schottenheimer, who just completed his first season as the Jets' offensive coordinator, removed his name from consideration for the Miami Dolphins' coaching job yesterday.  Schottenheimer, 33, met for a preliminary interview with the Dolphins' owner, Wayne Huizenga, in the New York area last week. He was one of three candidates invited back for a second interview. The former Falcons coach Jim Mora and Georgia Tech Coach Chan Gailey were the others.  In a statement announcing his decision, Schottenheimer, who was the quarterbacks coach for the San Diego Chargers before moving to New York, said, ''I am committed to the New York Jets.''  Schottenheimer's liberal use of shifts, motions and formations gave the Jets' offense a kaleidoscope of looks that made defending it a challenge. In a statement, Coach Eric Mangini acknowledged Schottenheimer's contribution to the success of the Jets, who were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the New England Patriots after finishing the regular season 10-6.  ''Brian's creative approach on offense was an integral part of our progress in the 2006 season,'' Mangini said in a statement, ''and I'm pleased he will remain with the Jets to build on that progress.''  DECLARING FOR DRAFT -- Ted Ginn Jr., Ohio State's game-breaking receiver and return man, and Adrian Peterson, Oklahoma's fleet running back, will pass up their senior seasons to enter the N.F.L. draft. Yesterday was the deadline for underclassmen to declare their intentions.  A week after his team lost to Florida, 41-14, in the Bowl Championship Series title game, Ohio State tailback Antonio Pittman also said he was leaving early for the N.F.L.  Colt Brennan, the record-breaking Hawaii quarterback, declared himself eligible for the draft, too, but left himself the option of returning to the Warriors. Louisville quarterback Brian Brohm, however, said he was staying in college.  Ginn and Pittman will join Ohio State receiver Anthony Gonzalez, who announced last week that he would give up his final season of eligibility to turn pro.  Peterson will also pass up his senior year. He missed seven games last season because of a broken collarbone, and still ran for 1,012 yards and 12 touchdowns.  Brennan set the N.C.A.A. record with 58 touchdown passes last season in leading Hawaii to an 11-3 record. (AP)  STEELERS NARROW SEARCH TO THREE -- The assistant head coach Russ Grimm has emerged as the front-runner for the Steelers' coaching job, a search that was narrowed to three finalists yesterday after the offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt left for Arizona.  The Steelers identified Grimm, a Pittsburgh assistant for six years, and the defensive coordinators Mike Tomlin of the Vikings and Ron Rivera of the Bears as the finalists to replace Bill Cowher. (AP)  COORDINATORS ON THE MOVE -- The Ravens promoted Rick Neuheisel to offensive coordinator, although Coach Brian Billick said he would continue to call the plays next season.  The Panthers fired Dan Henning, their offensive coordinator.  The Packers promoted Joe Philbin, the team's offensive line coach, to replace Jeff Jagodzinski as the team's offensive coordinator. Jagodzinski was hired as head coach at Boston College last month. (AP)  AROUND THE LEAGUE -- Robbie Tobeck, the Seahawks' former Pro Bowl center, retired yesterday.  Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck said that he played the final eight games of Seattle's season with broken fingers on his nonpassing hand. (AP)  N.F.L. ROUNDUP",

            "fulltext": "A coalition of community groups is calling for the city Department of Education to develop a ''Marshall Plan for middle-grade schools,'' saying that all too often, the sixth through eighth grades become ''pathways to failure.''  In a report scheduled to be released at a news conference today, the coalition calls for a rigorous curriculum with advanced course offerings in all middle schools, classes of no more than 20 students each, and the creation of a new position within the department: a deputy chancellor who would focus on ''ensuring proper coordination and alignment'' among middle schools, high schools, college and the working world.  Noting that city middle school teachers tend to be less experienced than their elementary and high school counterparts, and are more likely to teach outside their license area, the report also calls for more teacher mentoring programs, as well as ''new incentive strategies'' to attract and retain qualified middle school teachers and principals.  The report was prepared by the community involvement program of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform, at Brown University, for an assortment of parent and community groups calling themselves the New York City Coalition for Educational Justice.  ''Middle schools have been relatively ignored in reform efforts in the city, but they're crucial,'' said Norm Fruchter, director of the community involvement program. ''You're not going to get good high school outcomes without paying attention to middle schools.''  David Cantor, a spokesman for the Education Department, said in a statement that the department considered the middle school years ''of critical importance.''  He said the department had put in place ''serious and lasting'' reform efforts, including the addition of $40 million yearly for struggling middle school students, closing failing middle schools, creating K-8 and 6th- through 12th-grade schools, and carving large middle schools into ''small learning communities.''",

            "fulltext": "Scorecard, Not Scores  My son is a student at a Miami prep school for children with learning issues. His SAT scores, after much tutoring, averaged 900 on the verbal and math sections. He has a great grade point average -- 3.6 (no Advanced Placement) -- but is simply a terrible test-taker, even with untimed allowances. Do you have suggestions for resources that will help us choose a college that cares more about hard work and perseverance than SATs? He would like a school in a warm climate, and he is an excellent golfer, probably could play on a Division III team.  Robin Polsky,  Coral Gables, Fla.  THANKS to a growing trend, your son can start thinking about that collegiate hole in one. The SAT and ACT are optional at a lengthening list of colleges that focus more on grades, essays and extracurriculars.  Consult the Web site of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing (fairtest.org) for a list of well over 700 colleges and universities, from Portland State on the West Coast to Drew on the East, that have test-optional policies. The list runs by state as well as alphabetically, so you can do a circuit through the South looking for a Division III school.  David R. Parker, director of the University Program for College Students With Learning Disabilities at the University of Connecticut, suggests treating the search and application process as a training ground for college itself. Your son should investigate his options from golf to whatever services he might need as a student himself. To succeed, Dr. Parker says, any student with a learning disability has to be ''independent and a self-advocate.''  One guide to leaf through is ''Peterson's Colleges With Programs for Students With Learning Disabilities or Attention Deficit Disorder.'' Schwablearning.org, started by the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation, posts articles about navigating school issues. One by Loring Brinckerhoff, director of disability policy at the Educational Testing Service, highlights colleges with good comprehensive programs, including the University of Arizona in Tucson, Curry College in Massachusetts, Stanford and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Older, Not Richer  Do you know of any resources for older (58) people to obtain funds for grad school? Living stipends to attend full time? I am interested in a master's in social work. My preference is to transition into a new career as a middle-school guidance counselor. Another possibility, quite different from the above, is a degree at the Fashion Institute of Technology in jewelry making, repair, gemology, etc. The goal would then be to start a business.  Carol Tannenbaum,  Passaic, N.J.  ATTENDING grad school full time is never easy, but there are almost always financial options short of turning to a life of crime. First, though: financial advisers caution against taking on too much debt so close to traditional retirement age, even if embarking on a new career.  Graduate students can get much the same financial aid as undergraduates -- work-study, federal Stafford loans, merit grants -- but no Pell grants or PLUS loans. And they can borrow a lot more with a Stafford loan than undergraduates can, up to $18,500.  Jacqueline E. King, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the American Council on Education in Washington, warns that graduate programs in professions like social work and fashion tend not to give as much grant money. Academic programs are more generous; they can raise research money, and graduate students offer teaching assistance to large pools of undergraduates.  Dr. King advises to look broadly. For example, the Manufacturing Jewelers and Suppliers of America in Rhode Island offers scholarship money to those working or studying in the field. For your social work goal, if you're willing to work in a critical-need area, the federal government and many states, including New York and New Jersey, offer loan forgiveness programs. For information: www.socialworkers.org.  And though you don't yet qualify, many state schools offer deals for older students. Rutgers allows anyone who is 62 and retired to audit for free an unlimited number of most courses. While you don't get credit, knowledge alone may help you break into a new field. You even get free parking and a school e-mail account.  Have questions on education?

Help  Correction:  January 14, 2007, Sunday  An article in the special Education Life section last Sunday about the large percentage of Asian students at the University of California, Berkeley, attributed an erroneous distinction to the state. Hawaii -- not California -- was the first state without a racial majority.  Also, an article about financial aid for graduate students misstated eligibility for federal PLUS loans. Graduate students may indeed apply for the loans; they became eligible in July 2006.  And an article about rigorous high schools misstated the student newspaper job held by Prateek Kumar of Phillips Academy, who talked about his challenging courses.

            "fulltext": "THIS past November, the Greenwich High School principal, Alan J. Capasso, greeted an early morning assembly of more than 800 freshmen about to begin a mandatory anti-bias, anti-bullying program called ''Names Can Really Hurt Us.'' He told them, ''This is the most important day of your school year.''  In Greenwich, where diverse doesn't begin to describe the pan-cultural buzz animating the school's hangar-size cafeteria, ''Names,'' as the program is known, is cool -- as in ''Hey, you doing 'Names' this year? It rocks.'' After five years, ''Names'' day is assured a place on the school calendar, along with homecoming, SAT prep and the prom.  Farther north at New Milford High School, Jonathan Henion, a senior, stood before a ''Names'' assembly of sophomores to share a story he insisted was no big deal, except that it suggested how one small action could make a difference:  ''I was standing in the rotunda with friends of mine, about 30 kids. I noticed this small girl walking by. She had on a big backpack filled with heavy books, and she fell. I just stood there watching and thought to myself, 'What a loser.' She just lay there trying to get up. The girl's face kept getting redder and redder listening to the relentless taunting by my friends. Something clicked. I walked over and lifted her up, picked up her books and brushed the dirt off her arms.''  Jonathan's little moment was greeted with huge applause; he looked surprised. New Milford's principal, Greg P. Shugrue, sharing pizza with Jonathan and other student panelists afterward, told them: ''This is the best school atmosphere I've ever worked in. And it's because of the commitment to this program.''  ''Names,'' which requires two months of preparation and training by students and staff members, is not a program that any participant or observer can easily forget. There is straight talk. There are tears, hugs, high-fives, laughs, applause and some astonishing apologies.  ''I went to observe it at Weston High School in 2000,'' said Carol Sutton, a social studies teacher and the catalyst for bringing ''Names'' to Greenwich. ''What I saw was astounding. I was impressed by the student panelists and the kids who got up in the open-mike segment. I was amazed. I came back and said, 'Let's get it done.' ''  Over the last 11 years, some 65,600 Connecticut high school students have participated in ''Names,'' which is sponsored and supervised by the Connecticut Office of the Anti-Defamation League. Guided by teachers, trained student volunteers and league facilitators, students talk with the unflinching candor of children about topics most adults would prefer to avoid: gossip, rumor, physical harassment, racism, homophobia, depression, eating disorders, self-mutilation, drinking, drugs, suicide -- the full range of bullying behavior and its consequences.  Some students who spoke in small group and open-mike discussions are quoted here, but to protect their privacy, neither they nor their schools are identified.  Marji Lipshez-Shapiro, the Anti-Defamation League's Connecticut regional director of education, who created the program in 1995, said that she first sensed the testimonial power of students' voices when she was dean of residential life at Connecticut College in the mid-1980s. Teenagers do talk freely to this engaging educator who moves easily among them. As one boy, a senior, put it, ''Marji's da bomb.''  Ms. Lipshez-Shapiro said: ''Kids are the ones who really know what's going on. When I walk through a cafeteria and I watch the social interaction, I realize what it takes to survive that, before you even get to academics.  ''A lot of kids hurt,'' she said. ''In a forum like this, they can hear their own voices, they can make a difference. Like 'Wow, my little story is going to impact people.' ''  In group discussions and in an open-mike session, the stories spool out. Often, just speaking them aloud is an act of courage. Witness the overweight girl reciting the names she has been called, the former stutterer who rehearsed for a month to articulate her agonies, the boy rolling up his sleeves to reveal arms crisscrossed with scars from self-inflicted cuts. A popular teacher described the day he heard his gay son sobbing in his room, then found his schoolbooks scrawled with vicious antigay slurs.  On ''Names'' day, nobody minces words:  ''So, um, I've got A.D.H.D., I was finally diagnosed. At least I don't think I'm a freak anymore. I'm on medication now and working really hard. People remember me the way I was, but I'm not like that anymore. I'm not. I'm just asking -- give me a second chance, O.K.? Just come up and say, Hi. Please.''  And from another student:  ''My sister is autistic. You see her in the hallway but you don't know her. She's the sweetest, most wonderful person. But no one will talk to her to find out. Why does she have to hear the words retard and spaz? Why does she have to come home crying every day?''  In a darkened school auditorium, Ms. Lipshez-Shapiro's eyes welled up when a boy explained how he had to ask his best friends to stop calling him D. J. ''Some of them didn't even get it, that D.J. was short for dirty Jew,'' he said. ''They apologized. They really didn't understand how it hurt.'' It is rare that anti-Semitism comes up in ''Names,'' but Ms. Lipshez-Shapiro explained why an organization devoted to combating that ancient transgression got into the bully business. ''At A.D.L., we look at the consequences of being different, at prejudices and stereotyping and discrimination,'' she said. ''The main reason people are bullied is because they're different or perceived to be. Our programs are really anti-bias more than anti-bully. Our goal is to teach empathy to perpetrators. A lot of times they have no idea of the power of what they're doing.''  Few educators would argue against the need for a positive form of intervention. In 2001, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development identified school bullying as a growing public health problem. Its commissioned study found that 29 percent of the nearly 16,000 American students surveyed said that they had experienced bullying, either as a target, offender or both.  ''Names'' is one of many anti-bullying programs being deployed across the nation by concerned PTAs, school boards, community theater groups and even by the Girl Scouts of America. Twenty-nine states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, have enacted legislation against bullying, intimidation or harassment and 11 others are in the process, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And New York has passed an education law that requires school districts to devise strategies to deal with violence as part of a school safety plan.  ''Wherever we take the program, we've found that the issues raised are basically the same,'' said a league facilitator, Sandra Vonniessen-Applebee. Though school bullies have been around longer than chalkboards, their playground and their reach have expanded in the information age. Young, media-saturated lives traverse an electronic landscape, peopled with elite ''Survivor'' and ''American Idol'' winners and an ever-growing pool of reality show losers. There are bully-centric teenage and kiddie flicks (''Mean Girls,'' ''Ant Bully''). Teenage chick lit series (''Gossip Girl,'' ''The Clique'') are bristling with hissy, sarcastic vipers wrapped in Juicy Couture. And there is Bully, a video game that depicts the adolescent atrocities facing the new student in a fictional boarding school.  ''It is a pervasive media message that being mean is cool, with put-downs and the like,'' Ms. Lipshez-Shapiro, said, noting that cyber-bullying, which invokes rumor and insults via the popular social-networking sites Facebook and MySpace, has become a huge concern.  ''I was online and I saw that someone posted something really lame about the Spanish kids taking over the best tables in the cafeteria. It was a lot of mean garbage about illegals. And I thought, well, the kids that did it are just jerks. Then I thought no, you can't just do nothing, that's not right. These things get bigger and out of control. So I showed it to the guidance office, and they dealt with it.''  It was a ''bingo!'' moment for the Anti-Defamation League facilitators who heard this comment at a meeting of student panelists.  ''Yes! Now that's becoming an ally,'' said William H. Foster III, the charismatic facilitator who emcees ''Names'' days with warmth, wit and a touch of Bernie Mac. Ms. Lipshez-Shapiro added: ''We want to empower the targets so that they feel yes, I can develop tools to fight back and say stop. And we want to teach bystanders to become allies. That's the ultimate goal.''  Can bully education work? A pioneering 1988 study done in Norway by Dan Olweus, a social researcher, found that the incidence of bullying in Norwegian schools fell by 50 percent or more in the two years after an anti-bullying campaign; truancy, theft and vandalism also dropped markedly.  A follow-up survey of the ''Names'' program in San Diego in 2000 found that 60 percent of students said that after the session they would be less likely to call someone a name; nearly half reported positive changes in other students' behavior.  ''You probably have seen me around, and you might think I'm just some weird loner. I'm in foster care; this is like my fifth or sixth school, and when you're all going home to your parents, my sister and I are going to a group home. It's hard to keep starting over, so sometimes I don't even dare to try. But if you see somebody alone all the time, just remember, they're not necessarily freaky. There's a story there -- a life. And they could probably use a friend.''  What price, such poignant social education? The scheduling logistics and expense of a ''Names'' program can be daunting to already-stretched budgets. The Anti-Defamation League pays $1,000 of an average $5,000 cost, which entails everything from hiring substitutes for participating teachers to audio-visual aids. But school systems across the tristate area are also mindful of a rise in costly bully-related litigation.  In Toms River, N.J., a seven-year-old case reached the New Jersey Supreme Court last November. Connecticut, which recently strengthened its anti-bullying law, has seen a spate of suits in Greenwich, Berlin and Stonington.  ''Maybe I do like emo music. And you can see by my long hair and my clothes that I look kind of different than other guys. But I like the way me and my friends look -- some crazy, dark, baggy clothes and stuff but it's us, it's harmless. Then I find this note in my locker: Emo bitch! Who gets off on doing that sort of thing? Why?''  Trying to change the hearts and minds of bullies can be a risky business. Not all schools opt for the open-mike segment of ''Names,'' when audience members line up to speak their minds, though it is very popular with students. League facilitators are at the speakers' elbows, ready to intervene should matters get too emotional. Guidance counselors are on hand for especially fragile speakers.  But in the sessions witnessed by a reporter, it was fellow students, with cheers, group hugs and tissues, who provided the most enveloping and accepting reinforcement. Even those who apologized, among them teary, self-confessed mean girls, were embraced.  ''I'm still on the fence about the open-mike part,'' said Mr. Shugrue, the New Milford principal, recalling an incident at another school when a student used the forum to mock the proceedings. League facilitators say they have never encountered this and that owing to the strict confidentiality policies for ''Names,'' there have been no complaints from parents.  ''The first year, I got some calls from parents asking, 'What is this race program you're doing?' '' recalled Kris Kaczkak, health education chairwoman at New Milford. ''But now that parents know what it is, we get great support. Our teachers volunteer anywhere from 6 to 50 hours each of their time. And I have 150 student volunteers for 50 places.''  If forgiveness and grace are shining ideals of ''Names,'' both are met in Lorella Praeli, a lively, chestnut-maned senior who delivered a bravura closing address at New Milford's ''Names'' day.  Afterward, in between accepting hugs and congratulations, she talked about her experiences as a bullying target before ''Names'' helped her defuse the problems:  ''I have a right prosthetic leg; I lost my leg in a car accident when I was 2 1/2. So all my life I've heard rude remarks about it. And I'm from Peru. I moved here about six years ago. So I've faced racism. I've had the words spoken to my face, behind my back and online. You know, PegLeg. Spic. Border Hopper.''  Lorella, who has spoken at many other league-sponsored anti-bias events, plans a career in advocacy, perhaps beginning with a law degree. Despite what she has endured, she said she refused to describe herself as a victim, preferring to focus on her conversion from a bystander.  ''I wasn't the person who stopped someone from using a word that they shouldn't have,'' she said. ''I thought, oh, it's O.K. After the program I began to recognize that it wasn't. I feel that this program has changed the school. It's not the same as my sophomore year.''  Right after her speech, one student asked her how she expected ''Names'' to change a whole class, 400 students. Lorella answered: ''I told her you don't need to change the whole class. Go for one person first.''  Carrie Malcolm, now 24 and a reformed bully, said that ''Names'' changed the course of her life, though too late for her victim. As a middle school honor student, leader and volunteer, Ms. Malcolm had a secret life as the tormenter, along with six friends, of a quiet girl named Erin. ''She was an outcast,'' Ms. Malcolm said, ''and I was the ringleader of making her life miserable.  ''I remember chasing Erin down the hallway and into a classroom, singing some awful song that I had made up about her. She was cornered against the blackboard, crying. And I wouldn't stop screaming this song. Then I just walked away and enjoyed the rest of my afternoon.''  Hoping to get away from the group, Erin chose to go to a different area high school. In 1997, she was killed in a car accident on the way to class. ''We made the last few years of her short life utter hell,'' said Ms. Malcolm, who, with Ms. Lipshez-Shapiro's encouragement and guidance, told her story on ''Names'' day as a sophomore at her regional high school in Durham, a year after Erin's death. At Ms. Malcolm's invitation, Erin's mother and grandmother were in the audience. Hers was a powerful, self-lacerating speech. And she says she cannot let the matter rest.  She has chosen a career in public service, tutoring underserved urban students in New Haven as the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Teaching, Learning and Child Development. And she has spoken at more than 25 Anti-Defamation League-sponsored bullying programs for students, teachers and parents. ''I really want to get to parents,'' she said. ''My story exemplifies what middle school bullying is like, that nobody really feels they need to do anything about it. Parents seem to ignore it and think it was a regular part of growing up. I stress that it doesn't have to be that way. And I'll do it over and over in front of parents, administrators and teachers, people that have the power to change it.''  Another ''Names'' open-mike session was coming to a close. The final speaker, a rangy boy in a hoodie sweatshirt, had been pacing nervously.  ''Ah  yo. I just want to say I'm up here talking for me and my friends. You all know us, right? Yeah. I've probably picked on most of you. And if any of us made fun of you, I'm here to tell you we're sorry. It wasn't cool. We're really sorry. Peace.''

They are Ossining High School, Greenburgh Eleven High School in Dobbs Ferry, Sleepy Hollow Middle School in Tarrytown and School 23 in Yonkers.  Schools are designated in need of improvement when students do not show enough progress on statewide tests in English and mathematics. For the first time this year, schools were judged on the scores of students in the third, fifth, sixth and seventh grades, in addition to fourth, eighth and 11th graders. Not only must schools show improvement over all, but they must also meet achievement targets for component groups, like racial categories and special education.  Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act, schools that receive federal money must replace administrators or close schools if they do not improve after several years. Roosevelt High School and Emerson Middle School in Yonkers have already reorganized, and two other Yonkers middle schools, Commerce and Museum, are planning to do so this year.  ''We made the decision to redesign Roosevelt so it became two schools, with designated administrative staff for each,'' said Jerilynne Fierstein, spokeswoman for the district. ''The idea is to personalize the instruction and stay more focused on the curriculum.''  The state also removed three schools from the list because of improvements in scores, including two high schools in Yonkers, Lincoln and Gorton, that reversed several consecutive years of failure. ''We are thrilled,'' Ms. Fierstein said. ''It was quite an accomplishment for the staffs of those schools.''  Schools that do not receive federal money are not subject to No Child Left Behind sanctions, but are required to meet state demands for improvement if their students do not meet targets. Twelve of the 23 failing schools are on that list, which is referred to as ''schools requiring academic progress.''  THE WEEK",

You also claim that ''many charter schools do a superb job.'' Where is the evidence?  In most of Connecticut's charter schools, the percentage of students meeting targets on the Connecticut Mastery Test and Connecticut Academic Performance Test is below the state average -- sometimes well below. This evidence is consistent with the conclusions of studies conducted across this country -- that students in charter schools do no better than those in traditional public schools, on state tests and on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The one, admittedly limited, study finding promise in Connecticut's charter schools attributes a large part of this success precisely to the state's strict limits on expansion that you decry.  Where charter schools succeed in Connecticut, there is no evidence that ''educational innovation'' is at play, as you claim, rather than longer school hours, smaller schools and smaller class sizes than those in traditional public schools. These conditions have been long known to educators and parents to raise student achievement.

What had kept me out of public urban education was the prospect of teaching at a school whose faculty and administration were not reform-minded. I wanted my efforts to be supported, but under the seniority-based system of placement, my desire to be part of positive change was irrelevant.  Why would a well-meaning principal try to be a reformer? He or she would have no hand in selecting the faculty.  I now work with like-minded colleagues and administrators in a Philadelphia public school, but it was possible only when an alternative to the seniority-based placement system was created.  Matthew C. Baird  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  To the Editor:  Finding teachers for the neediest classrooms is a challenge for many school districts.  Regrettably, and all too often, assignments to these positions are seen as the ''dues'' new teachers must pay before they can work their way through the system and transfer to schools considered to be more desirable.  One way to curb this trend would be to limit the percentage of novice teachers that can be assigned to high-needs schools and to provide a higher level of support for beginning teachers in these positions.  It would also help if schools serving the neediest children were directed by experienced and highly qualified administrators.  Howard Miller  Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is an associate professor of literacy education at Mercy College.  To the Editor:  The ''bumping'' process that you describe is bogus.  The seniority rule regarding assignment to a school is: if a vacancy occurs, it is filled by seniority. Even this procedure has been watered down by the site-selection process, in which teachers must interview for a vacant position and seniority plays no part.  The idea that teachers change schools willy-nilly at their own choice is a myth.  John Jaros  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is a teacher.",

The difference between high-powered high schools like those mentioned in the article (merely 68 schools supplied over 20 percent of Yale's 2006 freshman class) and mine, where the college counselor had not heard of the top-ranked liberal arts colleges where I applied, is not academic; it's social.  Many classmates from schools like Andover and Dalton arrive at college fighting to get into the most selective major and singing group and, later, the best law school and investment bank -- realms that preserve the ''I'll take you down'' moral certitude they learned in high school.

Elsewhere in the state, 27 schools have similarly been deemed failing, a designation that means they could eventually face penalties . At the same time, 52 schools across the state, including 27 in New York City, performed well enough last year to return to good standing.  For the first time this year, elementary and middle schools were judged not just by the standardized English and math scores of their fourth and eighth graders, but by the scores of all students in Grades 3 through 8. And so, even though more city schools were added to the list than removed, the New York City Education Department portrayed the news as promising.  ''Today's announcement shows that we have made lasting improvements in our schools and need to continue to make progress in order to ensure success for all our students,'' Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said in a statement.  Schools are deemed failing, or ''in need of improvement,'' if they fail to make ''adequate yearly progress,'' a standard set by the state, in the same category for two years in a row. In a hallmark of the federal law, schools are judged not just on the overall performance of their student body, but also on the scores of various subgroups, like special education students. This means that even a school highly sought after by parents could wind up on the dreaded list.  Only schools that receive federal Title I antipoverty money are in danger of being designated as ''in need of improvement.''  In past years, the state released a complete list of failing schools in September. But last September, the State Education Department released a partial list naming only failing high schools, citing delays related to the new, more extensive testing regimen.  The schools identified yesterday include 16 in the Bronx, 12 in Manhattan, 11 in Brooklyn, 5 in Queens and 2 on Staten Island. One is a charter high school for students who have struggled elsewhere.  When schools are designated as failing, parents must be notified and given the right to request that their children be transferred. But New York City, like many school districts across the country, limits the number of transfer requests it grants.  Each year that a school fails to make progress brings another set of requirements. Ultimately, districts may close failing schools; over the summer New York City closed 19 poorly performing schools.  The state also named 17 schools, including 6 in New York City, that do not receive federal antipoverty money and are therefore not subject to the same scrutiny under the federal law, but that similarly underperformed. Thirty-three schools, including 12 in New York City, were taken off that list.  Because some failing schools closed, and the poverty status of others changed, the statewide total of failing Title I schools dropped to 506 from 511 based on 2004-5 test results. New York City now has 335 such schools, up from 332.",

Social intelligence is perhaps what our nation needs now more than ever.

            "fulltext": "To the Editor:  Re ''Taking the Middle Schoolers Out of the Middle'' (''The Critical Years'' series, front page, Jan. 22):  Yes, students of middle school age are hard to place. But before we dismantle middle schools, let's first see if we even gave them a chance.  Middle schools were designed to provide a place between the self-contained classroom of elementary school and the fragmented world of high school.  A middle school is built around teams, where the same teachers teach the same students, with opportunities to meet during the day to collaborate about curriculum and student progress, providing effective communication with parents, counselors and administration.  I have taught in such a program in both New York and here in California. But such programs are holding on by a thread. It takes district-led vision and commitment to design and support these programs.  A well-structured middle school can make a real difference in these crucial transitional years.  Steve Carson  San Francisco, Jan. 22, 2007  To the Editor:  The middle grades are not about what grade levels occupy a building, but what happens in any building to meet the learning needs of children ages 10 to 15.  I appreciate that you've highlighted the current restructuring trends. But to really gauge what is happening in the two schools, K-8 or 6-12, we must look critically at student achievement and adjustment levels and what program elements contribute to student success.  In New York City, as elsewhere, we need academically rigorous, developmentally appropriate and socially equitable schools for students ages 10 to 15. We need to stop thinking of grade restructuring as a silver bullet and start addressing what's going on inside.  In order to provide adolescents with the tools they need to succeed, policy makers must work with educators to use research-based practices to transform what's happening inside our nation's middle grades and not be satisfied with superficial fixes.  Deborah Kasak  Exec. Dir., National Forum to  Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform  Champaign, Ill., Jan. 23, 2007  To the Editor:  Your Jan. 22 article about middle schools reports that some middle school experts see ''smaller classes, an engaging curriculum, personalized attention and well-prepared teachers'' as effective responses to the challenge of teaching young adolescents.  This is correct.  We need to address the developmental needs of young adolescents, regardless of whether they are in a K-8, 5-9 or 6-12 configuration. This is what the middle school movement advocates.  Ross  M. Burkhardt  Las Cruces, N.M., Jan. 22, 2007  The writer is a past president of the National Middle School Association.  To the Editor:  Closing middle schools and moving the students into K-8 schools may or may not improve outcomes for former middle schoolers, but such a shift is not likely to benefit the youngest children in the building.  In research for my recent book, I visited schools in more than a dozen states and concluded that young children are best served in schools that concentrate on constructing a learning foundation for them from pre-kindergarten through third grade.  The focus -- without the distraction of catering to older students -- should be on providing them with the academic skills, understanding, habits and dispositions that will serve them throughout their education.  This kind of grounding is not apt to occur in today's K-8 school, which inevitably gives greatest attention to the test scores of older students and preparing them for high school.  If K-8 schools grow more prevalent, then they should create a school within a school for the youngest children with their own assistant principal, a separate support staff and separate professional development for teachers. They should also have their own wing of the building, an area where everybody is ''primary minded,'' as a second grade teacher in Glen Ridge, N.J., put it to me.  Gene I. Maeroff  Edison, N.J., Jan. 22, 2007  The writer is a senior fellow at Teachers College, Columbia University.  To the Editor:  As the parent of two seventh graders in middle school and one ninth grader in her first year of high school, I read the Jan. 22 article about middle schools with interest.  Nowhere was the issue of drugs and alcohol mentioned. The article notes that some educators argue that ''11-, 12- and 13-year-olds thrive in the presence of older role models and reminders of concrete goals, like playing varsity sports and getting into college.''  But these older students can also provide easy access to drugs and alcohol -- access that most probably would not be found if students remained longer in middle schools.  Felice Kobrick  East Hills, N.Y., Jan. 22, 2007  To the Editor:  As parents of three sons -- 11, 14 and 16 years old -- who have changed schools twice in recent years, my wife and I have a few insights into the middle school debate.  For one, middle school presents a host of challenges regardless of the model, and the best way to meet them is by communicating regularly with your child's teachers and, most vital, with your child.  Our sons are happily enrolled at Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, and its success in nudging its middle school students toward adulthood while nurturing them with the care appropriate to their age (why should the two goals contradict each other?) is indeed laudable.  But that success is hardly the simple outcome of a particular model. It is the result of a tireless principal with high expectations, and a dedicated teaching staff determined to meet them.

            "fulltext": "Even in their absence, the Grateful Dead can pack a hall. On Saturday night, the World Financial Center's Winter Garden was filled to capacity for the first night of the American Beauty Project: various groups performing all the songs on ''Workingman's Dead.'' (Sunday's concert covered ''American Beauty,'' the other album the Dead released in 1970.) None of the Dead were on the bill; the aura was enough.  ''Workingman's Dead'' and ''American Beauty'' were the kind of music few had expected from the San Francisco band devoted to sprawling psychedelic jams. They were carefully rehearsed collections of concise songs, rootsy and pensive, somberly reconsidering the late 1960s. ''Workingman's Dead'' was the bleaker of the two: a collection of songs about jobs, duty and death, topics that weren't a big part of the hippie agenda.  The concert lineup, produced by David Spelman (who also played guitar in an instrumental duo between songs), mirrored the eclecticism of the Dead and generally recast the songs.  Catherine Russell, a longtime backup singer, was the concert's discovery. With the Holmes Brothers, she turned ''High Time'' into wistful, sultry rhythm and blues. She sang ''New Speedway Boogie'' over a jazzy bass vamp and Larry Campbell's mandolin, in a skeletal arrangement that only heightened the song's philosophical reflections. And she merged her voice precisely with Jim Lauderdale's classic country twang when he sang the deathbed testimony of ''Black Peter'' in a string-band arrangement.  In the concert's biggest stylistic stretch, the Klezmatics jovially relocated the bluegrass oompah of ''Cumberland Blues'' to somewhere in Eastern Europe, where it could take on a hora interlude. Another klezmer musician, the clarinetist Andy Statman, played an instrumental interlude backed by the twangy drone of a Brazilian berimbau. There was no discernible Dead content but plenty of sinuous melody in a long, modal, Greek-flavored improvisation allegedly based on ''Uncle John's Band.'' The banjo virtuoso Tony Trischka turned up with a Jerry Garcia rarity: a minor-key banjo tune, ''Jerry's Breakdown,'' from 1964.  Mr. Campbell on guitar and Rob Barraco on vocals (who have been in the band led by the Dead's bassist, Phil Lesh) carried ''Dire Wolf'' back toward ragtime picking. Ollabelle, less successfully, tried ''Uncle John's Band'' with the lilt of ''Sugar Magnolia.'' And Tim O'Reagan shifted ''Easy Wind'' from blues to brooding ballad. The concert's full-ensemble encore was also death-haunted: Bob Dylan's ''Knockin' on Heaven's Door,'' with a ghostly falsetto by Popsy Dixon of the Holmes Brothers.  One band was happy to emulate the Dead: Railroad Earth, a jam band with the lineup of a traditional bluegrass band plus a drummer. It started ''Casey Jones'' with a folk version of the song about the dying railroad engineer, then switched to the Dead song, using its rhythm and instrumental hooks (though they were played on mandolin and fiddle with banjo counterpoint). As soon as the song turned familiar, Dead fans in the crowd were up and dancing.  MUSIC REVIEW",

            "fulltext": "Gov't Mule played two Beatles songs as encores at the Beacon Theater on Friday night. Earlier in the show the band covered Cream, Jimi Hendrix, Willie Dixon (by way of Howlin' Wolf) and Little Milton (via Jerry Garcia). A James Brown jam was offered in tribute. A Stevie Wonder vamp cropped up in a Mahavishnu Orchestra tune. And during John Fogerty's ''Effigy'' there were quotations of Johnny Cash songs.  That clutter of references does a decent job of summing up Gov't Mule, a jam band with more than a casual investment in classic rock, soul and the blues. The Friday concert, the first in a three-night run, was typical: a seesaw of dense, hard riffs and rambling digressions. Along the way there was room for original tunes spanning the group's 11-year recording career. (It helps that the concert lasted well over three hours.)  The originals -- and, for that matter, the array of influences -- came courtesy of Warren Haynes, Gov't Mule's lead singer and guitarist. Mr. Haynes hails from a Southern-rock tradition of shaggy virtuosity. And as he regularly does as a guitarist in the Allman Brothers Band, which has also been known to set up shop at the Beacon, he galvanized. It was unmistakably his show, despite the reliable cohesion of his band.  As a singer he makes ample use of a bluesy rasp, flexing it to fit whatever dynamic the music demands. So he was convincingly sweet-tempered on ''Hide Your Love Away,'' one of the Beatles songs. Elsewhere he mostly howled.  On ''Brand New Angel,'' a psychedelic tune from ''High and Mighty,'' Gov't Mule's latest album, his harnessed rage made the chorus sound like something by Soundgarden. Then came ''Mr. High & Mighty,'' the album's lead track: the juicy hard-rock riff, coupled with a strained vocal, evoked vintage AC/DC. It's probably not a good thing that the originals weren't much more original than the covers, but Mr. Haynes made that seem forgivable.  The guitar playing helped. Most of his solos evolved from choice single notes to an ecstatic strumming wail, producing a sense of tension and drama. And his rapport with the drummer Matt Abts, the keyboardist Danny Louis and the bassist Andy Hess felt rewardingly deep. But because Mr. Haynes went long on every tune, tedium occasionally set in.  So it was a relief when Mr. Haynes brought on other guitarists as foils: the versatile Jimmy Vivino on several tunes, as well as Cesar Rojas and David Hidalgo, both members of the veteran Los Angeles band Los Lobos. Nobody posed a serious challenge to Mr. Haynes, but they all nudged him in productive ways.  As an opener Los Lobos provided an interesting contrast to Gov't Mule. Los Lobos drew heavily from their recent album ''The Town and the City'' and leaned on a smoldering sort of atmosphere. Mr. Hidalgo and Mr. Rojas took turns soloing and singing; there was no obvious star in the ranks.  Los Lobos' set was far less dynamic than Gov't Mule's, and not nearly as free-flowing. But as the irresistible groove of ''Chuco's Cumbia'' segued into the sinuous meditation of ''The Valley,'' a nifty spell was cast. Los Lobos had a perspective, and a sound, to call its own.  Then again they seemed to have the most fun on a cover of Buddy Holly's ''Not Fade Away.'' And that was after Mr. Haynes had joined them onstage.  MUSIC REVIEW  Correction:  January 9, 2007, Tuesday  A music review on Jan. 1 about Gov't Mule and Los Lobos, at the Beacon Theater, misstated the surname of a member of Los Lobos.

            "fulltext": "Exploding Star Orchestra  The cornetist Rob Mazurek originally convened his Exploding Star Orchestra for a commissioned concert a year and a half ago at Millennium Park in Chicago. ''We Are All From Somewhere Else'' (Thrill Jockey), the group's phantasmagorical first album, was recorded in a studio some time later with many of the same musicians. Mr. Mazurek, a Chicago native who now lives in Brazil, divides the album neatly into two suites, each with its own whimsically oblique story line. (Sting rays, phoenixes and the violent energies of the universe are involved.) Writing for 14 pieces, he employs strategies somehow evocative of both Lalo Schifrin and Andrew Hill. Swirling action is his strong suit, even when the working conceit is a group improvisation against the recorded hum of electric eels. The flutist Nicole Mitchell and the guitarist Jeff Parker make the strongest individual impressions, along with Mr. Mazurek, who augments his cornet with electronics. But the orchestra itself demands a wide-angle focus. At times its multilayered sonic atmosphere suggests an expanded edition of the instrumental rock group Tortoise, with which it shares several members, including Mr. Parker. As engineered by John McEntire, another Tortoise transplant, this album comes across as a work of ambition, imagination and panache.  Holmes Brothers  Sherman and Wendell Holmes, who play bass and guitar respectively, and Popsy Dixon, who plays drums, have been making music as the Holmes Brothers for more than 25 years. Their sweetly raspy vocal harmonies, deeply rooted in gospel, bring an irrepressible uplift to their new release, ''State of Grace'' (Alligator). It's not all warmth and sunlight though: the opener, a song by Wendell Holmes called ''Smiling Face Hiding a Weeping Heart,'' sets the tone. Nick Lowe's ''(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding'' ideally suits this dynamic, and a pair of songs by Lyle Lovett work too. The producer Craig Street captures the group's rustic style without much fuss, adding only seasoned studio hands like the guitarist Larry Campbell and the keyboardist Glenn Patscha. He also brings in a few respectful guest singers: Joan Osborne, who tackles a song made famous by Bill Monroe; Rosanne Cash, who finesses a classic by Hank Williams; and Levon Helm, whose reedy vocal on ''I've Just Seen the Rock of Ages'' is the right thing at the right time. (The Holmes Brothers perform with Allen Toussaint on Monday night at Joe's Pub.)  Bill Evans  Bill Evans led a handful of trios throughout his career, each one a vehicle for his precisely fluttering pianism. A new DVD, ''The Oslo Concerts,'' available from Shanachie on Jan. 30, documents a pair of performances nearly 15 years apart, and the contrast is striking. The first, with the bassist Eddie Gomez and the drummer Alex Riel, takes place at the Munch Museum in October 1966. It's a chiming, almost somber performance, right down to the poker faces in the Norwegian audience. (Four of the seven songs from the concert can be found on YouTube.) The second concert dates from August 1980, when Mr. Evans performed a set at the Molde Jazz Festival with an even better trio, featuring Marc Johnson on bass and Joe La Barbera on drums. But Mr. Evans's style had changed by then, with a rhythmic feel more suggestive of a surge than a swell. He prefaces ''Nardis,'' which in 1966 was a floating mystery, with some startlingly emphatic arabesques. It's tempting to view the performance as a last gasp -- a month later, Mr. Evans would be gone -- but as a postconcert interview illuminates, it was just one stop along the road.  Tony Trischka  The title of ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' (Rounder), the latest effort by Tony Trischka, is almost comically self-descriptive. It's a bluegrass album, no question, and on it Mr. Trischka matches wits and fingertips with a bushel of fellow banjoists, from the venerable Earl Scruggs to Alison Brown of Union Station to Steve Martin (yes, that Steve Martin). There are also solid contributions by members of the Johnson Mountain Boys and other kindred spirits, like Nickel Creek's Chris Thile on mandolin. Virtuosity is the standard, so much so that the rush of 16th notes can level off into a blur. But Mr. Trischka presents his guests with tunes that swerve from harmonic complacency or fretboard clich\u00e9. The longest and most incandescent track is ''Twilight Kingdom,'' which includes Stuart Duncan on fiddle, Jerry Douglas on dobro and David Grier on guitar. At its center is an exchange between Mr. Trischka and his former student B\u00e9la Fleck; that's where the spectacular comes into play. (Mr. Trischka appears with Soulgrass, led by the saxophonist Bill Evans, at the Blue Note Tuesday through Jan. 28.)  Mira Calix  ''Eyes Set Against the Sun'' (Warp) is the latest electro-acoustic odyssey by Mira Calix, also known as Chantal Passamonte, the composer and producer from Suffolk, England. Though a shade precious at times, it's an engaging trip, thanks largely to a broad expanse of timbres. Twittering birds, jangling keys and rustling foliage all play roles here; so do violins, a children's choir and the airy, distracted voice of Ms. Calix herself. The album occasionally drones, but more often it catches the attention one intricate detail at a time.  MUSIC: PLAYLIST  Correction:  January 28, 2007, Sunday  A review last Sunday of Tony Trischka's album ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' in the Playlist column misidentified a guest banjoist, Alison Brown.

            "fulltext": "Peter Bjorn and John kept flipping between two eras -- the Merseybeat mid-1960s and the new wave early 1980s -- during their sold-out set at the Mercury Lounge on Monday night. Both were times of crisp, upbeat, tuneful pop-rock: the first bright-eyed and fresh, the second more knowing and self-conscious. Peter Moren (on guitar), Bjorn Yttling (on bass) and John Eriksson (on drums) don't set out to revolutionize their chosen styles, only to give them a brisk, smart workout.  Peter Bjorn and John are from Stockholm, but they sing in English and sound largely British. Their stage clothes hinted at an alliance of mod (Mr. Moren in a suit), rocker (Mr. Yttling in a leather jacket) and punk (Mr. Eriksson in black with close-cropped hair). All three are songwriters, and they take turns on lead vocals, but leave most of them to Mr. Moren, whose voice has touches of John Lennon.  They understand pop songs as nuggets of emotion delivered in mechanisms of riff and hook, repetition and surprise. And they sing about falling in love and (more often) breaking up with concise verses -- ''Your tongue is sharp, but I miss the taste of it'' -- and reprises that don't wear out their welcomes. They also like to whistle many of their hooks, like the one in their European hit ''Young Folks,'' a wary lovers' duet. On Monday they brought along Victoria Bergsman, until recently of the Concretes, another Swedish band.  The trio's analytical side, its artisanal delight in the formulas of pop, comes through on its albums. Its new one, ''Writer's Block'' (Almost Gold), captures the songs with schematic clarity. Onstage, Peter Bjorn and John were casual between songs -- they introduced themselves as ''Peanut, Butter, Jelly'' -- yet utterly precise during them, locking into every riff.  Live, the songs were no longer just neat exercises in pop structure. On Monday, Peter Bjorn and John hugely expanded the dynamics of their music. There was tension in an exposed bass riff, diffidence or resentment or triumph in the vocals, a fiercer attack as Mr. Moren laid on bursts of guitar. ''The Chills,'' which harks back to the postpunk minimalism of Joy Division, was extended and revved up with furious guitar tremolos and cymbal crashes, sounding far less resigned to the breakup it describes than it does on the album. The craftsmanship of the song was still fully displayed, but so was the passion behind it.  MUSIC REVIEW",

            "fulltext": "Michael Brecker, a saxophonist who won 11 Grammy Awards and was among the most influential musicians in jazz since the 1960s, died on Saturday in New York. He was 57 and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.  The cause was leukemia, said Darryl Pitt, his manager.  Having taken a deep understanding of John Coltrane's saxophone vocabulary and applied it to music that merged with mainstream culture -- particularly jazz fusion and singer-songwriter pop of the 1970s and '80s -- Mr. Brecker spread his sound all over the world.  For a time, he seemed nearly ubiquitous. His discography -- it contains more than 900 albums -- started in 1969, when he played on the record ''Score'' with a band led by his brother, the trumpeter Randy Brecker. It continued in 1970 with an album by Dreams, the jazz-rock band he led with his brother and the drummer Billy Cobham.  His long list of sideman work from that point forward wended through hundreds more records, including ones by Frank Zappa, Aerosmith, James Brown, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Lou Reed, Funkadelic, Steely Dan, John Lennon, Elton John and James Taylor, as well as, on the jazz side, Chick Corea, Pat Metheny, Gonzalo Rubalcaba and Papo Vasquez. His 11 Grammys included two for ''Wide Angles,'' his ambitious last album, released in 2003 with a 15-piece band he called the Quindectet.  His highest achievements were his own albums, both under his own name (starting in 1986) and with the Brecker Brothers Band, as well as his early-1980s work with the group Steps Ahead. Mr. Brecker was scheduled to tour with a reunited version of Steps Ahead in the summer of 2005 when his condition was publicly announced -- initially as myelodysplastic syndrome, a bone-marrow disorder, which finally progressed to leukemia -- and much of his work had to stop.  Mr. Brecker grew up in a musical family in Philadelphia; his father was a lawyer who played jazz piano. He started playing the clarinet at age 6, switched to alto saxophone in the 8th grade, and finally settled on tenor saxophone in the 10th. He started to attend Indiana University -- as did Randy Brecker. After initially pursuing a music degree and then briefly switching to pre-med, he quickly discovered he preferred to be playing music. He left for New York at 19.  For most of the 1970s and through the mid-80s he worked hard in studio sessions, becoming a fixture on albums by members of the Southern California pop singer-songwriter movement, including Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell. But for hard-core jazz enthusiasts, it was his work of the early 80s -- on Steps Ahead's first two albums, when the band was simply called Steps, as well as on Chick Corea's ''Three Quartets,'' from 1981, and Pat Metheny's ''80/81,'' from 1980 -- that cemented his reputation as a great player.  His tone was strong and focused, and some of his recognizable language echoed Coltrane's sound. But having worked in pop, where a solo must be strong and to the point, Mr. Brecker was above all a condenser of exciting devices into short spaces. He could fold the full pitch range of the horn into a short solo, from altissimo to the lowest notes, and connect rarefied ideas to the rich, soulful phrasing of saxophonists like Junior Walker.  In the 1980s and 1990s he experimented with the electronic wind instrument called the EWI, which allowed him to blow through an electronic hornlike device, play a range of sampled sounds, and multitrack them in real time. He began experimenting with the instrument again in the last few years.  With the onset of his illness, he and his family called for bone-marrow donors at international jazz festivals, synagogues and Jewish community centers around America; tens of thousands responded. Working sporadically over the last year, he managed to complete his final album two weeks ago, Mr. Pitt said.  Mr. Brecker is survived by his wife, Susan; his children, Jessica and Sam, of Hastings-on-Hudson; his brother, Randy, of Manhattan; and a sister, Emily Brecker Greenberg of Philadelphia.

            "fulltext": "'London Is the Place for Me 4'  I deeply love this whole series of CDs, which illustrate the interplay among West Indian musicians, African musicians and jazz in London during the '50s and '60s. You can surely do better elsewhere for the apotheosis of Nigerian highlife, for calypso and certainly for jazz. But these records (put out by the British label Honest Jon's) are fascinating for their magically agreeable mixture of cultures in exile, and possibly because such unimpeachably beautiful ''world music'' comes with lyrics in the queen's English. The fourth and newest volume (subtitled ''African Dreams and the Piccadilly High Life'') is scattered with calypsonians like Lord Kitchener, Young Growler and Young Tiger, and high-life bands like the African Messengers. There are also British Afro-Caribbean jazz bands, like those led by Shake Keane and Cab Kaye, playing Cuban-derived music. Very few of the musicians on this or other volumes of the series are known in the United States (except for the African Messengers' bassist, David Williams, who plays with the New York jazz pianist Cedar Walton's trio). But listen hard, take in Valerie Wilmer's evocative black-and-white photographs in the inserts, read the text, and you can begin to make out the dimensions of a great mongrelized music in gloomy postwar London, an underrated time and place if there ever was one. (Order from honestjons.com.)  David Crosby  From London circa 1954 to San Francisco circa 1970: here's another record that suggests an entire social atmosphere. Mr. Crosby isn't one of my favorite figures in the history of music and may not be one of yours, but ''If I Could Only Remember My Name,'' his first solo record -- made after his initial success with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, but before that band entered its long tunnel of crassness -- is weirdly potent, a record with a fascinating melancholy. Its woolly studio jams outnumber the more arranged pieces, yet everything is recorded so beautifully and richly that you can practically smell the pot smoke. (More so with the DVD surround-sound mix on the second disc of Rhino's new reissue; it also comes with a pretty good unreleased track.) Most of those who would become the senior partners of Counterculture Inc. were on hand: Joni Mitchell; Jerry Garcia (playing killingly beautiful steel guitar on ''Laughing''), as well as Phil Lesh and Bill Kreutzmann of the Grateful Dead; Graham Nash and Neil Young; Grace Slick, David Freiberg, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane. It's all as self-indulgent as Jack Nicholson's opening monologue in Bob Rafelson's 1972 movie, ''The King of Marvin Gardens'' -- a work of art that seemed to come from the same transcendental malaise -- but just as intense.  Deerhoof  When a postpunk band made its music more broadly likable, the stupidest kind of Manichaean conversations followed: the general idea was that once its vocals were upfront and clear, instead of indistinct and mumbly amid the wash of midrange sounds, a band had crossed over to the other side and lost its individuality. The San Francisco band Deerhoof has now made its first completely clear-sounding album in ''Friend Opportunity'' (Kill Rock Stars). Gone are most of the scratching, scrunching noises that previously signified a low budget, and now there are crisp multitracked vocals. But the band hasn't gotten any less imaginative. Preparation is the secret to control: besides making the music swell and crest like any of the best rock bands, Deerhoof composes rigorously, with strange, stirring chord changes. A tune in the middle of the record called ''Whither the Invisible Birds?'' makes it plain: with piano, synthesizer and Satomi Matsuzaki's guileless voice, it's an art song, condensed and episodic in just over two minutes.  Bonnie (Prince) Billy  The release of Bonnie (Prince) Billy's superb and mature ''Letting Go'' has been a protracted event. The album has been out since September, but its label, Drag City, has released three singles from it, including the newest, an understated and beautiful folk-tronic ballad called ''Lay and Love,'' with extra tracks that didn't appear on the CD; there have also been four videos, and four commercials for the album. (They're all on the label's Web site, dragcity.com.) This isn't such an odd strategy to get attention for a good record, but Will Oldham -- the man behind the Bonnie (Prince) Billy moniker -- is a hero of the non sequitur, and he makes all this seem like an absurd imitation of music marketing. One of the best commercials for the album features the comedian Neil Hamburger furtively sneaking out of a hotel room, looking for an ice machine; the camera enters the room he's just left, and there's Mr. Oldham, bound and gagged in his underpants. One of the best videos, for ''Ebb Tide,'' features Mr. Oldham dressed as some sort of fowl, having a glass of milk and some birthday cake.  Polwechsel  A German-Austrian-British band that equally mixes electronics and acoustic instruments, and improvisation and composition, Polwechsel is fully abstract, if you consider lack of melody the definition of abstraction in music. With ''Archives of the North'' (Hat Hut), its third album, the group has reached a state of refined grace. It now has the drummers Burkhard Beins and Martin Brandlmayr, the saxophonist John Butcher, the bassist Werner Dafeldecker, and Michael Moser on cello and computer. Working together, they make the most beautiful bowings and chimings and scrapings, blending them so that it all becomes one fluid motion. It's lovely music that some people might not call music at all.  Cortney Tidwell  A young Nashville-based singer and songwriter, Ms. Tidwell follows the idea of pop music as a slow, unfolding, abstract dream -- the kind of thing Mazzy Star used to do pretty well -- but it's a dream rooted in an actual place. The little bits of lazy, echoed steel guitar in her first full-length record, ''Don't Let the Stars Keep Us Tangled Up'' (Ever), and its layered vocal harmonies, make it more recognizably American and Southern; it's a shaggy record, but there's extreme beauty in parts of it.

            "fulltext": "Scott Colley  ''Architect of the Silent Moment''  (Cam Jazz)  The bassist Scott Colley plays with a warm, singing tone and a nimble touch when briskness is required. On his sixth album as a leader he traffics mainly in ostinato -- most of his bass lines are asymmetrical, hypnotic and harmonically static -- while his ensemble floats purposefully above him.  Mr. Colley seems intent on showcasing his compositions, and in that regard this album is a handsome success. It's also a useful gauge of the interests now gripping an increasing number of post-post-bop musicians: long-form ensemble writing, rippling dynamic fluctuations and a moody equipoise rooted as much in rock and classical minimalism as in jazz.  Songs like ''Strip Mall Ballet'' and ''Masoosong'' unmistakably evoke the Pat Metheny Group, and not just because of the presence of the adroit Antonio Sanchez (on drums) and the charismatic Gr\u00e9goire Maret (on harmonica), two present members of that group. Elsewhere the trumpeter Ralph Alessi expertly carries off Mr. Colley's slippery melodies in conjunction with the keyboardist Craig Taborn; at times the alto saxophonist David Binney and the pianist Jason Moran lend a hand. Free improvisation crops up bracingly but fleetingly, like a bout of airborne turbulence between cruising altitudes.  As a title ''Architect of the Silent Moment'' implies calibration as well as introspection, which is apt, since Mr. Colley engages in both at once. That the result never gets oppressive is a credit to the band, which brings fluid movement to his designs.  NATE CHINEN",

            "fulltext": "The pianist Kenny Barron has a brisk but unostentatious technique and a deceptively casual way with a phrase. He conveys a number of things clearly in his playing; what comes across over all is the quiet hum of effortless erudition. Within his playing you can hear a digest of mainstream jazz piano traditions, with bebop as the root. You can also hear the measured tension of an expert nudging himself toward a challenge.  Mr. Barron began a run at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday with Kiyoshi Kitagawa on bass and Francisco Mela on drums. The trio's first set started strong, with a spidery piano introduction that tumbled into a songbook standard. It was ''How Deep Is the Ocean?'' by Irving Berlin, and it showcased the group's strengths efficiently. Mr. Barron navigated the harmonic contours of the tune with fluid aplomb, borrowing some agile stylistic devices from Bill Evans. Mr. Kitagawa shadowed him with a responsive bass line, nimble and gliding, before shaping a concise and thoughtful solo. Mr. Mela applied a mischievous tilt to his time feel, occasionally interrupting a steady-ride cymbal pattern to issue asymmetrical accents on his toms.  The group fared even better on a pair of songs by Thelonious Monk, a pianist and composer to whom Mr. Barron has paid ample homage over the years. ''Ask Me Now'' began with a masterly solo introduction, as Mr. Barron engaged a pianistic voice steeped in Monk's dialect but refreshingly free of his mannerisms.  ''Well You Needn't'' was more of a collective feature, bright and bursting. Accompanied only by Mr. Mela at first, Mr. Barron dived into his version of post-bop modernism, mixing hornlike right-hand flourishes with chiming left-hand drones. When Mr. Kitagawa entered, shifting the band into a fast-walking swing, there was spontaneous applause.  A similar moment transpired during during ''Seascape,'' one of Mr. Barron's original tunes, when Mr. Mela opened the throttle of his rhythmic engine, inspiring an impressive upsweeping glissando from the pianist. But the song itself felt static, as if its form was too familiar to inspire much drama.  Similar suspicions were triggered by ''Um Beijo,'' an original ballad that Mr. Barron outfitted with unfocused meanderings instead of his usual clear-eyed lyricism; and by ''Calypso,'' a ditty with a rhythmically prescriptive title. There was promise in both tunes, but neither prompted Mr. Barron to reach beyond the proficiency that, for another pianist, might be an end in itself.  Kenny Barron continues through Sunday at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com.  MUSIC REVIEW",

            "fulltext": "The saxophonist Greg Osby is one of the most specific writers and arrangers in jazz. He makes small-group music that can be aslant with odd or long meter, and serenely played; it's not battering or superexpressive, but glows within its own tight structure. Always, he comes with a grid.  But the group under his name at the Jazz Standard this week, Greg Osby and the Organization, is more casual. It's a quartet that includes the Philadelphia organist Trudy Pitts, who is now in her 70s and an important link to the history of her city's jazz scene. Mr. Osby is deferential toward her, and more willing than usual to wing it. In Thursday's late set, for all intents and purposes, she was as much the boss as he was.  Ms. Pitts began the set on piano and, with Mr. Osby alone, played ''Body and Soul.'' She allowed a lot of open space into her playing, and she transferred some of the organ's inherent drama to the piano: she presented ideas one after the other, sequentially and charismatically, swelling and quieting. Mr. Osby picked around the famous melody subversively, running parallel to Ms. Pitts, taking wide harmonic routes around the horn without going dissonant.  They were joined by the guitarist Paul Bollenback and the drummer Gene Jackson -- crisp, clean-sounding musicians -- and they started a version of Milt Jackson's blues ''Bags' Groove,'' with Ms. Pitts on organ. The Hammond B-3 is a high-expression machine: if you are not riding the volume pedal and the vibrato control, you are not really playing it.  Ms. Pitts wrung them out, going from a muted tinkle to a rippling, volcanic roar. (There was visual theater in the solo as well: the sight of Ms. Pitts, amiable and grandmotherly, wincing and shaking her head, magicked by her own sounds.)  When she finished her solo, she seemed to leave a crater behind her. And Mr. Osby, in emergency mode, started to sound more outgoing, working blues phrases and sweet, high-register shouts into his playing, channeling bits of Cannonball Adderley.  Mr. Bollenback, for his part, is fluent in 1960s-style organ-jazz guitar accompaniment as an almost classical style: the muted tone; the short, fast runs; and subtle slides. His response to this challenge, and all those that followed, was to play faster and more smoothly, using sweep-picking and extended harmony.  Warming to her work, Ms. Pitts began adding extras to songs, directing arrangements and shaping the set. She sang an introduction to ''Autumn Leaves,'' elongating phrases as she liked; she added a cadenza in that same song, interpolating Handel's ''Hallelujah'' chorus; she transformed ''Caravan'' into ''Amazing Grace.''  Ms. Pitts had personality to spread around, and there was nothing to be done about it: the rest of the band sounded narrower in her presence.  Greg Osby and the Organization, featuring Trudy Pitts, continues through tomorrow night at the Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan; (212) 576-2232.  MUSIC REVIEW",

Mr. Harrison, an alto saxophonist born in New Orleans in 1960, has never been anything less than interesting in his various bandleading iterations since the mid-'80s, and he has occasionally been stunning, for instance when playing the music of the Mardi Gras Indians or sharing a front line with the trumpeter Terence Blanchard. He's got sophisticated new harmony under his thumb, and he's a near-genius of rhythm. Mr. Miller, five years older, keeps turning jazz back toward whatever passes for its vernacular sources these days: blues and soul and the modern riverheads of tradition, McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock. 8 and 10:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday (both bands play each set), Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; at cover charge at tables, $25.

Tarantolo, the mayor of Eatontown, N.J., places a price tag on the 452 acres of land his town hopes to acquire when Fort Monmouth closes, he is not exaggerating.  ''Hopefully, $1 will be able to pay for it,'' he said. ''After all, we do have a long history with Fort Monmouth.''  The fort -- established in 1917 as Camp Little Silver and renamed in 1925 in honor of Revolutionary War soldiers who died in the battle of Monmouth Court House -- is scheduled to close by Sept. 20, 2011, part of an effort to cut military spending.  When the fences come down, Eatontown and the neighboring Monmouth County boroughs of Oceanport and Tinton Falls could inherit and divide 1,126 acres of Fort Monmouth property within their borders.  Mr. Tarantolo and the other mayors, Lucille Chaump of Oceanport and Peter Maclearie of Tinton Falls, are considering how best to use the property, which not only would alter their existing landscapes but could also have a major economic impact.  The Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Planning Authority, a 10-member panel that includes the three mayors, must approve plans for the land. The authority is required to make its decision by Dec. 8.  ''With this additional land, Eatontown will grow by 11 percent,'' Mr. Tarantolo said. ''The initial mind-set is to just expand on what we already have, but that might not be the way to pursue this. By growing, you run into a lot of problems, like providing new schools, enlarging your police force and maybe even expanding the Public Works Department.''  According to Mr. Tarantolo, Eatowntown's piece of the Fort Monmouth pie would include 486 units of vacant military housing, an 18-hole golf course, a football complex with a track and a 20-lane bowling center.  While Eatontown and Oceanport hope to share a fitness center that includes an indoor swimming pool, a gymnasium, a weight room and two racquetball courts, Oceanport's potential bonanza includes a marina and a parade ground that could be used for general recreation.  ''We've hired a planner to help us look at this space,'' said Ms. Chaump, who said she expected 419 acres. ''We're going to have town meetings to discuss housing, open space, commercial space, traffic and anything else regarding this expansion.''  With Oceanport receiving the smallest parcel -- roughly 252 acres, including an outdoor swimming pool -- Mr. Maclearie said his preference ''would not be to expand but to keep the extra land as open space.''  The mayors want the federal government to turn over large areas -- a combined 352 acres -- through what is called a public benefit conveyance, or as Ms. Chaump put it, ''a 100 percent discount.'' Although the remaining 774 acres would belong to the towns, the Defense Department would seek fair-market value from anyone who wants to build there.  Ms. Chaump said that if the planning authority approves handing over the land to the towns, the Fort Monmouth Open Space and Recreation Resources Group -- which plans open-space use and which the three mayors belong to -- will decide how best to maintain the additional land.  The towns, along with any government agency or nonprofit group seeking free or reduced-price facilities, have until March 8 to make their best pitches for the land.  Mr. Tarantolo said his $1 bid would be accompanied by a reminder that since the late 1950s, Eatontown has ''accepted the responsibility of paying the bill to educate the children of military dependents.''  He said that if the land conveyance occurs, all three towns ''will really need professional land consultants to help us through this transition.''  ''Essentially, when Fort Monmouth closes, it will become three towns, and we must all figure out how we will reuse this land,'' he said. ''We all have a lot of studying to do.''  DEVELOPMENT  Correction:  February 4, 2007, Sunday  An article last Sunday about plans for the property at Fort Monmouth, N.J., after it is closed misidentified the borough that would receive the smallest parcel, of 252 acres, and whose mayor prefers to keep the land as open space.

After a judge dismissed a lawsuit over the sale of the land to a housing developer, state officials agreed Dec. 28 on a new plan to transfer the property to the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for use as parkland.  A total of 368 acres will be added to Nissequogue River State Park, and 90 acres will be set aside for development. A separate 2.6 acres will be used by the Kings Park Fire District, and 36 acres will remain with the Office of Mental Health.  Land where vacant buildings now stand will be leased to a developer, providing revenue to the park system.  The transfer of the property was made possible when Judge Elizabeth Hazlitt Emerson of State Supreme Court in Riverhead dismissed a lawsuit on Dec. 15 that had been filed by the Arker Companies and Cherokee Northeast. Her ruling canceled the sale of the property to the developers, who had proposed 1,800 units of town houses and condominiums.  The transfer to the state supersedes a proposal by State Senator John J. Flanagan, who had secured $25 million from the state to clean up the site and had been working to transfer the property to the Town of Smithtown. He called the revised plan ''a terrific opportunity for the residents of Kings Park.''  ''It protects taxpayers by preserving tax payments to the Kings Park School District and preserves the open space of this beautiful parcel of land,'' Mr. Flanagan said.  Not everyone was as supportive. Patrick R.

He appointed an advisory committee to evaluate the projects. Nominations begin Thursday and continue until March 15.  ''The more information given, the better,'' said Thomas F.

''If a group wants to improve a parkland area to provide recreational opportunities for disadvantaged kids, that's helpful information to provide.''

Mr. Maher said he was expecting more nominations this time. ''There seems to be more interest after the success of the first bond act,'' he said. ''And now we have double the money to spend.''  Just as the county did with the first environmental act, it could finance projects in open space acquisition, parkland improvement, storm water quality improvement and brownfield remediation, Mr. Maher said.

            "fulltext": "Judith Miller, a former reporter for The New York Times, testified Tuesday as a witness for the prosecutor who had put her in jail for 85 days, recounting details of her once-confidential interviews with I. Lewis Libby Jr.  Ms. Miller had initially refused to cooperate with the government in its investigation of Mr. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, saying she would not violate her oath of confidentiality to Mr. Libby. But the special prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, with the support of the federal courts, had her jailed until she relented. She asserted that Mr. Libby had released her from her vow of confidentiality.  As she began her testimony, she was calm and soft-voiced as she faced Mr. Fitzgerald, who is still investigating her in an unrelated case, and discussed three conversations she had had in June and July of 2003 with Mr. Libby. Those conversations, in which Ms. Miller said an agitated and anxious Mr. Libby criticized the Central Intelligence Agency and informed her of the identity of an agency operative, Valerie Wilson, are a significant part of the perjury and obstruction case against him.  It was only after Mr. Fitzgerald briskly concluded his questioning, and Ms. Miller found herself facing a caustic cross-examination from one of Mr. Libby's defense lawyers, that her composure slowly withered. Under the questioning by the lawyer, William H. Jeffress Jr., who attacked her memory and credibility, she began to sigh frequently and grow testy in her responses.  Pressed about why she failed to remember an important June meeting with Mr. Libby during her first grand jury appearance, she said with her voice rising: ''Counselor, I've already said I didn't remember that meeting. I just didn't remember.''  The day ended with an extraordinary argument by lawyers for both sides, as well as a lawyer for Ms. Miller, over whether Mr. Jeffress could ask her if she had other sources she spoke to about Ms. Wilson. The question, which was left unresolved by Judge Reggie M. Walton until Wednesday, threatened to derail the trial over the very constitutional issue that saw Ms. Miller go to jail in 2005.  Judge Walton seemed disinclined to allow questions about Ms. Miller's other sources. ''I appreciate that there is an interest the media has in not having questions asked that aren't germane to this case,'' he said. But if he does allow them, and she refuses to answer, she could be held in contempt once again and a mistrial could result.  In her more than two hours on the stand, Ms. Miller became the focal point for an intense drama involving three people in the room: herself, Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Libby. As she provided the testimony that was most damaging to Mr. Libby, he sat almost motionless in his chair about 20 feet away and stared at her.  Mr. Fitzgerald first took her through her June 23, 2003, meeting with Mr. Libby. Mr. Libby, who she said was usually low key, ''appeared to be agitated and frustrated.''  He was unhappy about growing public concern that President Bush had used inaccurate information in his most recent State of the Union speech, in which he said there was evidence that Saddam Hussein had recently tried to acquire uranium from Africa.  She said Mr. Libby said the C.I.A. ''was beginning to backpedal from the unequivocal intelligence'' it had provided before the war about Iraq's efforts to obtain uranium.  He said the C.I.A. was doing so through ''a perverted war of leaks'' related to a fact-finding mission to Africa by Joseph C. Wilson IV, who was married to Ms. Wilson, also known by her maiden name, Valerie Plame.  ''Did he discuss the wife?'' Mr. Fitzgerald asked. ''Yes,'' Ms. Miller replied, adding that Mr. Libby had said Ms. Wilson worked at the agency's division that dealt with limiting the proliferation of unconventional weapons.  Ms. Miller said Mr. Libby told her that Mr. Cheney had asked the agency in early 2002 about Iraq and African uranium, and the C.I.A. decided to send Mr. Wilson on its own without telling the vice president.  She described a second meeting with Mr. Libby at a Washington hotel that lasted two hours, as well as some telephone calls.  The main line of attack by Mr. Jeffress concerned the fact that Ms. Miller did not describe the June 23, 2003, meeting with Mr. Libby when she first appeared before a grand jury on Sept. 30, 2005, the day after she got out of jail.  He noted with a large measure of sarcasm that she had just finished testifying in detail about Mr. Libby's comments and even his mood during the June 23 meeting. How was it possible that she forgot entirely about the same meeting before the grand jury? he asked.  Ms. Miller had said that her memory of the June 23 meeting was jogged only when she accidentally discovered a shopping bag full of notebooks under her desk in the Times newsroom. Her lawyer then informed Mr. Fitzgerald, and she described the previously forgotten meeting in a second appearance before the grand jury.  Ms. Miller is the first of a series of reporters who are lined up to dispute Mr. Libby's account of his behavior in the investigation of who may have leaked to the press Ms. Wilson's identity as a C.I.A. officer.  Beyond the drama of the day's proceedings, the appearance of Ms. Miller as someone forced by the government to testify against a source emphasized how the case has changed the landscape of relations between journalists and government officials.  As the day ended in the argument over whether Ms. Miller could be questioned about other sources, Judge Walton took the unusual step of calling on Ms. Miller's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, to explore what questions she might be willing to answer.  Mr. Bennett confirmed that Ms. Miller had already indicated she would testify she did not recall any sources other than Mr. Libby with whom she had discussed Mr. or Mrs. Wilson.  But the defense argued that it should be allowed to ask a broader question: whether she recalled other sources with whom she had discussed the issues raised by Mr. Wilson's July 6, 2003, Op-Ed article in The New York Times, which accused the Bush administration of twisting the intelligence that led to war. Mr. Jeffress argued that because Ms. Miller had said in a 2005 affidavit filed with the court that she had discussed those issues with multiple sources, he should be permitted to ask about them.  Mr. Fitzgerald, having once jailed her for protecting a source, now argued that she should not have to answer the question about sources.  ''I don't want to make the First Amendment argument,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said, noting the contradiction of his position. Instead, he argued that questions about sources on subjects other than the Wilsons were not relevant to the charges against Mr. Libby. If they were allowed, the prosecutor said, ''We're off on an irrelevant fishing expedition.''  But Theodore V. Wells Jr., one of Mr. Libby's lawyers, argued that Ms. Miller should be asked the questions so Mr. Libby could have an opportunity to impeach her credibility.  ''This is nothing more than classic 101 impeachment,'' Mr. Wells said. ''I don't think we have a First Amendment collision at this point.''  Ms. Miller left The New York Times in November 2005 after a 28-year career at the newspaper. Her reporting came under attack after articles she wrote suggested that Iraq possessed unconventional weapons, coverage that helped the Bush administration build its case for invading Iraq but that turned out to be wrong.  Mr. Fitzgerald is investigating Ms. Miller in an unrelated case involving Islamic charities. The government has contended that calls from reporters tipped off the charities to impending federal raids and asset seizures.  Correction:  February 2, 2007, Friday  A front-page article on Wednesday about the testimony by Judith Miller, a former reporter for The New York Times, in the trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr. referred incorrectly to an unrelated investigation by the Libby prosecutor in a case involving Ms. Miller's reporting on Islamic charities. The prosecutor is trying to find out who Ms. Miller's sources are, including by obtaining her telephone records. Ms. Miller is not herself under investigation in that case. The article also misstated the prosecutor's surname at one point. He is Patrick J. Fitzgerald, not Fitzpatrick.",

Lewis Libby Jr. -- who has been charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for his role related to the investigation of the outing of a C.I.A. operative -- has been taking far longer than expected. Mainly that is because so many of the potential jurors have expressed strong negative feelings about the Bush administration, the Iraq war and Vice President Dick Cheney, for whom Mr. Libby once served as chief of staff.  And then there is matter of the news media, which already finds itself in the spotlight because of Mr. Libby's conversations with reporters. One potential juror identified herself as an arts reporter for The Washington Post (reporters covering the trial agreed to keep the jurors' names private).  She told the judge, Reggie B. Walton, that as a journalist, she would like to think that she could set aside her personal feelings and concentrate on the facts in the case, as a journalist should.  But with Mr. Cheney, she could not. She said he put his business interests ahead of those of the country. She said she did not trust him and would have a hard time believing anyone who was associated with him.  If that wasn't enough to disqualify her, she also said that she was not sure that she could resist yakking about the trial to her colleagues at The Post or to her boyfriend, who is also a Post reporter.

            "fulltext": "Prosecutors in the perjury trial of the former White House aide I. Lewis Libby Jr. paraded a roster of former government officials before the jury on Wednesday to testify that they had informed him about the identity of the C.I.A. operative Valerie Wilson, contrary to Mr. Libby's claim that he had learned about her weeks later from reporters.  Mr. Libby's lawyers spent their time cross-examining those witnesses in an effort to attack both their credibility and their memory.  Mr. Libby, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, has put the issue of memory front and center in his defense on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. He is charged with lying to both a grand jury and to F.B.I. agents who were investigating the leak to reporters of the identity of Ms. Wilson.  Mr. Libby has sworn that he did not discuss Ms. Wilson's identity with reporters in the spring and summer of 2003. But two reporters, Judith Miller, formerly of The New York Times, and Matthew Cooper, formerly of Time Magazine, have testified that Mr. Libby explicitly told them about Ms. Wilson.  One official to testify, Robert L. Grenier, a former senior official at the Central Intelligence Agency, testified Wednesday that he received an anxious phone call from Mr. Libby on June 11, 2003, asking about reports that a former ambassador had made a trip to Africa to check on reports that Saddam Hussein had tried to buy uranium in Niger for Iraq's weapons program.  Mr. Libby, Mr. Grenier said, seemed irked by accounts that the former ambassador, Joseph C. Wilson IV, the husband of Ms. Wilson, was telling reporters that he had been sent on a fact-finding mission to Niger at the behest of the vice president's office.  Mr. Grenier said he promised to look into the matter, but before he could speak with Mr. Libby again, he was summoned out of a meeting with the director of the C.I.A. by Mr. Libby seeking answers.  He said he told Mr. Libby that Mr. Wilson did indeed go on the mission to Africa and he added, as an afterthought, that Mr. Wilson's wife, who is also known as Valerie Plame, worked at the C.I.A.  The purpose of Mr. Grenier's testimony from the prosecutor's point of view was to cast doubt on Mr. Libby's account that he did not remember learning about Ms. Wilson from officials when he testified that he learned about her from journalists.  But William H. Jeffress Jr., one of Mr. Libby's lawyers, quickly set about taking apart Mr. Grenier's account. He noted that in his first appearance before a grand jury and in an interview with F.B.I. agents, Mr. Grenier did not say he had told Mr. Libby about Ms. Wilson.  Mr. Grenier said he had not remembered that part of the conversation with Mr. Libby and only recalled it more than a year later when he went before a grand jury again.  With a generous dollop of scorn, Mr. Jeffress asked why Mr. Grenier had first told the grand jury that he had no recollection of telling Mr. Libby about Ms. Wilson, only to change his story later.  ''I was saying what I thought was true at the time, and I subsequently had a different recollection,'' replied Mr. Grenier, who held a high rank in the agency as Iraq mission manager.  Mr. Jeffress asked, ''Do you find that your memory gets better the further away from an event?''  Mr. Libby's lawyers seemed to have two agendas in mind. Not only did they want to underscore the fragility of memory -- Mr. Libby has said that if he testified incorrectly about his conversations with reporters it was only because he simply remembered incorrectly -- but also to create a vexing, lengthy and complicated narrative for the jury.  The prosecution, in contrast, is aiming for a streamlined and simple case: Did Mr. Libby knowingly lie to the grand jury and to F.B.I. agents?  Mr. Jeffress also quizzed Mr. Grenier about some of the ill-feeling between the White House and the C.I.A. over Mr. Wilson's trip. On Tuesday, Mr. Libby's chief lawyer, Theodore V. Wells Jr., startled the court when he said that his client had been made a scapegoat by White House officials to protect Karl Rove, President Bush's principal political adviser.  Craig Schmall, a C.I.A. employee whose job was to brief Mr. Libby and Mr. Cheney, testified that his notes showed Mr. Libby had spoken to him on June 14, 2003, and that he was annoyed by Mr. Wilson's trip to Niger.  On cross-examination, Mr. Schmall acknowledged that Mr. Libby's workday in that period was taken up with issues like Iraq developments, an East African terrorist network and Al Qaeda.  Mr. Schmall's notes from a session with Mr. Libby show a comment about the actors Tom Cruise and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, who had visited the White House and raised concerns about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany. ''He was a little excited about it, and I was a little excited about it,'' Mr. Schmall said of the celebrity moment in their day.  Earlier, Mr. Libby's defense team went after the memory and credibility of Marc Grossman, the former under secretary of state. He had given statements that he had been asked on May 29, 2003, by Mr. Libby about the Wilson trip. He said that after canvassing the State Department he reported back that Mr. Wilson had made the trip for the C.I.A. and that his wife had played a major role in selecting him for the mission.",

            "fulltext": "As the perjury and obstruction of justice trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr. unfolds over the next few weeks, the ways in which the case has vastly reshaped relations between reporters and high government officials will be on vivid display.  Most striking, a handful of reporters for major news organizations will testify for the prosecution. They will be asked to recount conversations they had in 2003 with Mr. Libby, then Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, that were undertaken with some understanding that they were confidential.  The highly unusual spectacle of journalists giving testimony at a criminal trial about their reporting is a result of the intense investigation into the disclosure of the identity of a Central Intelligence Agency operative. Previous leak investigations typically ended in failure as reporters were able to fend off prosecutors' efforts to delve into what they learned from government sources.  But in trying to determine how Valerie Wilson, who was known by her maiden name, Valerie Plame, came to be identified as a C.I.A. operative in a newspaper column in July 2003, the prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, successfully pressed reporters to testify before a grand jury, threatening jail if they refused. In the case of one, Judith Miller, formerly of The New York Times, Mr. Fitzgerald, with the backing of the courts, succeeded in having her jailed for 85 days until she relented.  Rodney A. Smolla, the dean of the University of Richmond Law School and an authority on the First Amendment, said the Libby investigation had made clear that any promise of confidentiality from a reporter now comes with an asterisk.  ''This has undercut the assumptions that existed for several decades that a reporter's promise of confidentiality is not only sacrosanct as a matter of journalistic ethics but relatively secure as a matter of law,'' Dr. Smolla said. ''Now it's clear that the legal system will try to break that promise, and the sources and reporter appear much more vulnerable, at least in the federal system, than was thought to be just a short time ago.''  There is no formal code that describes the rules of engagement for officials and reporters in Washington, but a less-than-neat system evolved over decades that allowed government sources to impart information to journalists without having their identities revealed publicly. Editors, hoping to be more accountable to the public, have tried in recent years to change those practices.  Nothing may have shaken those ways of doing business and the underlying relationships as much as the Libby case.  The impact in the workaday world is difficult to measure, as it is impossible to know of articles never written because officials decided not to risk becoming sources. Eve Burton, vice president of the Hearst Corporation, said her company had refrained from publishing or broadcasting stories in recent months to avoid the risk of becoming embroiled in a subpoena battle that could lead to fines and jail terms for reporters.  Another effect has been on how news organizations reconsider the pledges their journalists may make.  Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times, has suggested that reporters may sometimes wish to negotiate the conditions of confidentiality with a source.  In a speech in October, Mr. Keller said such negotiations could go something like this: ''I will keep your name out of the paper, and if I am subpoenaed as part of a leak investigation my paper will fight it. But if we lose in the courts I do not plan to go to jail or allow the paper to be fined into bankruptcy.''  Mr. Libby, who is known as Scooter, is charged with lying to both a grand jury and F.B.I. agents who were investigating the leak of Ms. Wilson's identity to journalists. The case began with a July 14, 2003, column by Robert D. Novak, saying that Ms. Wilson worked at the C.I.A. and was married to Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former ambassador who had days before accused the administration of distorting intelligence to help the case for going to war in Iraq.  Mr. Libby had nothing to do with the leak to Mr. Novak, but he testified under oath that he had not disclosed information about Ms. Wilson to other journalists. Ms. Miller and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine told the grand jury that he did, in fact, talk about Ms. Wilson with them. Mr. Libby also testified that he learned of Ms. Wilson's identity from a third journalist, Tim Russert of NBC News, but Mr. Russert is expected to testify that that is false.  Mr. Libby's lawyers are expected to argue that he did not tell those reporters about Ms. Wilson and that, even if he did, he remembered incorrectly what had happened.  Many people experienced in the capital game of source and reporter will understand the thesis Mr. Fitzgerald has put forward -- that Mr. Libby expected that reporters would successfully resist cooperating with law enforcement officials and that his conversations with them would never be revealed.  Mr. Fitzgerald has also said he may try to explore at trial the issue of whether waivers of confidentiality given by Mr. Libby to reporters in order to allow them to testify were genuine. Mr. Fitzgerald's goal would be to demonstrate that Mr. Libby was actually trying to hide information rather than have it disclosed.  To that end, the trial may try to solve one of the case's mysteries: whether there was any hidden meaning to a note Mr. Libby wrote to Ms. Miller giving her permission to testify before the grand jury. In September 2005, Mr. Libby wrote to Ms. Miller saying he had not spoken to reporters about Ms. Wilson and then relieving her of any journalistic obligation to keep their conversations confidential.  Mr. Libby told Ms. Miller, who was in jail at the time for refusing to cooperate with the prosecutor, that she should testify, get out of jail and experience the autumnal delight of Colorado's aspens changing color. ''Out West, where you vacation, the aspens will already be turning,'' Mr. Libby wrote. ''They turn in clusters because their roots connect them.''  Was that phrase a simple attempt at a literary turn? Or was it a veiled plea for Ms. Miller to ''turn'' with him and back up Mr. Libby's account that he had not disclosed Ms. Wilson's identity to her?  Before Ms. Miller went to jail, she dismissed the validity of an earlier waiver Mr. Libby had offered to all journalists. She asserted that such waivers from sitting government officials were inherently coerced.  Ms. Miller wrote in The Times that after two months in jail she ''owed it to herself'' to clarify whether Mr. Libby's waiver was genuine. She authorized her lawyers to seek an explicit waiver from Mr. Libby, which he granted in a telephone conversation and in the letter about aspens.  To challenge the sincerity of that waiver, Mr. Fitzgerald would probably note that, when Ms. Miller eventually testified before the grand jury, she provided information that was used against Mr. Libby in the indictment. If Ms. Miller testified truthfully to Mr. Libby's detriment, Mr. Fitzgerald may argue, then Mr. Libby must not have intended to encourage her to testify at all.",

            "fulltext": "Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary, recounted to a jury on Monday his experience at an unusual lunch on July 7, 2003, during which he said that I. Lewis Libby Jr. passed on detailed information about the identity of a Central Intelligence Agency operative.  The lunch in the White House mess for senior staff took place three days before the date that Mr. Libby had sworn he first learned about the C.I.A. officer, Valerie Wilson, from reporters.  Mr. Fleischer was the fifth prosecution witness to provide damaging testimony in the form of an account that conflicted with the version Mr. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, told a grand jury and investigators.  Mr. Fleischer's day on the stand provided a riveting moment because of the detailed description of the conversation, which he said occurred in his last week at the White House and was the only time Mr. Libby had ever asked him to lunch.  Mr. Fleischer said that after casual talk about his new career and the fact that he and Mr. Libby were both fans of the Miami Dolphins, the conversation turned to the controversy then swirling around whether President Bush had used false information in his State of the Union address about Iraqi efforts to obtain uranium in Africa.  The day before the lunch, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former ambassador, had written an Op-Ed article in The New York Times that said he had taken a trip to Niger at the behest of Mr. Cheney's office and had determined there was no truth to the assertion in the State of the Union speech that Saddam Hussein had recently tried to buy uranium ore in Africa.  ''Ambassador Wilson was sent by his wife,'' Mr. Fleischer testified that Mr. Libby told him, disputing the notion that he had been sent by Mr. Cheney. ''His wife works for the C.I.A.''  Mr. Fleischer also said that Mr. Libby used the woman's maiden name, Valerie Plame, and that she worked at the agency's bureau that dealt with efforts to curtail the proliferation of weapons.  ''He said it was hush-hush, on the Q.T. and that most people didn't know it,'' Mr. Fleischer testified.  Mr. Libby, who is widely known by his nickname, Scooter, looked up occasionally at the witness and took notes.  Ms. Wilson's name was first disclosed publicly on July 14, 2003, in a column by Robert D. Novak.  That disclosure led to an investigation into the leak as administration critics charged that her identity was disclosed to discredit Mr. Wilson's charges. Neither Mr. Libby nor anyone else was charged in the end with violating the law in disclosing Ms. Wilson's identity. Mr. Novak's original source, Richard L. Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state, was not charged, as prosecutors said he did not have the needed intention to violate the law.  But Mr. Libby was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice after he swore he had not discussed Ms. Wilson with reporters. Judith Miller, a former reporter for The New York Times, and Matthew Cooper, a former reporter for Time Magazine, told the grand jury that Mr. Libby had indeed disclosed her identity to them. Mr. Libby's lawyers have argued that if he was incorrect in recounting his conversations with reporters, it was simply a case of bad memory.  Mr. Fleischer, who as the public face of the White House for nearly three years and thus widely recognizable, was followed to the stand by a prosecution witness regarded as perhaps the most secretive and publicity-averse employee in the White House, David S. Addington.  Mr. Addington was counsel to Mr. Cheney at the time Ms. Wilson's identity was disclosed and has since been promoted to replace Mr. Libby as the vice president's chief of staff. He is widely reported to be the theoretician behind Mr. Cheney's belief in a powerful executive branch, in which the president may exert wide authority unchecked by Congress or the courts.  While Mr. Fleischer, an experienced public spokesman, seemed at ease on the stand, Mr. Addington displayed gruff reticence.  His testimony concerned a meeting he had had with Mr. Libby in a small room in the vice president's suite between July 6 and July 12. He said Mr. Libby had quizzed him as to whether the C.I.A. would have records showing when someone sent a relative on a mission.  Mr. Addington said his advice was sought because had he worked at the C.I.A. for years as a lawyer. As he provided the far-from-simple answer, he said that Mr. Libby had held out both hands in front, palms down, as if to remind him the information was sensitive. ''He said, 'Keep it down,' '' Mr. Addington testified.  But it was Mr. Fleischer's testimony that seemed the most damaging to date. He said he had heard again about Ms. Wilson four days later from the White House communications director, Dan Bartlett, aboard Air Force One as it was heading to Uganda. He said Mr. Bartlett was reading documents and began ''venting'' that reporters kept repeating Mr. Wilson's claim that it was Mr. Cheney who had sent Mr. Wilson on his fact-finding trip.  ''His wife sent him,'' Mr. Fleischer recalled Mr. Bartlett saying. ''She works at the C.I.A.''  Mr. Fleischer said he relayed that information to reporters from Time and NBC, a fact that figured in his later demand that he would testify only after being given a grant of immunity from prosecution.  When the investigation began in the fall of 2003, he said he was suddenly afraid he had inadvertently violated the law.  He said that, upon reading that Ms. Wilson's identity was classified, he thought to himself, ''Oh my God, did I somehow play a role in outing a C.I.A. operative?''  Mr. Fleischer freely cooperated with the government, he testified, while refusing to grant interviews to Mr. Libby's defense lawyers.  Aside from recounting that anxiety, Mr. Fleischer was unruffled on the stand, even under cross-examination by William H. Jeffress Jr., one of Mr. Libby's lawyers.  Mr. Jeffress noted that Mr. Fleischer had in earlier testimony shown he did not know how to pronounce the maiden name of Ms. Wilson, referring to her as Ms. Plame or Ms. Plah-MAY. He suggested to Mr. Fleischer that that meant ''the first time you ever heard it was reading it and not hearing it,'' meaning his account of the conversation with Mr. Libby was incorrect. Mr. Fleischer replied, ''No, when I heard it, it was not very important.''  Over all, as he had for nearly three years at the White House, Mr. Fleischer ''stayed on message.''  Before he took the stand, the jury heard the second day of testimony from Cathie Martin, who had been Mr. Cheney's communications director. Ms. Martin testified for the prosecution that she told Mr. Libby she had learned about Ms. Wilson and her role at the C.I.A. also before the date Mr. Libby claims to have learned about her.  Mr. Addington is expected to finish his testimony on Tuesday. He will be followed on the witness stand by Ms. Miller, the former Times reporter, who is expected to testify that Mr. Libby told her about Ms. Wilson on three occasions.",

            "fulltext": "I. Lewis Libby Jr., the vice president's former chief of staff, was made a scapegoat by White House officials to protect the president's longtime political adviser, Karl Rove, Mr. Libby's lawyer asserted in his opening statement on Tuesday.  The unexpected assertion may foreshadow an effort to put distance between Mr. Libby and the administration.  The statement by the lawyer, Theodore V. Wells Jr., was the first indication that Mr. Libby, who is facing five felony counts of lying to investigators, would seek to deflect some of the blame onto his former White House colleagues.  Mr. Wells did not, however, fully explain the connection between an effort to protect Mr. Rove and the actions that led to Mr. Libby's indictment. It was also the first sign that there had been fighting within the Bush administration over the C.I.A. leak investigation.  Until Tuesday, Mr. Libby's defense on perjury and obstruction of justice charges was that he might simply have remembered incorrectly events he had described to a grand jury and to F.B.I. agents. But Mr. Wells told the jury that White House officials, whom he did not name, wanted to protect Mr. Rove because they believed his survival as President Bush's chief political adviser was crucial to the health of the Republican Party.  Mr. Wells said that his client was innocent and that a decision was made that ''Scooter Libby was to be sacrificed,'' referring to Mr. Libby by his nickname. It was important to keep Mr. Rove out of trouble, Mr. Wells said, because he was Mr. Bush's right-hand man and ''was most responsible for seeing the Republican Party stayed in office.''  ''He had to be protected,'' Mr. Wells said.  Mr. Rove, who has not been charged, has acknowledged having been a source for a July 14, 2003, column by Robert D. Novak that first disclosed the identity of Valerie Wilson, who was known by her maiden name, Valerie Plame, as a Central Intelligence Agency officer. The disclosure led to the investigation resulting in Mr. Libby's indictment.  Mr. Wells's remarks followed the opening statement of the chief prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, who told the jury that the evidence was clear that Mr. Libby had knowingly lied under oath about his conversations with three reporters about Ms. Wilson. Mr. Fitzgerald provided his own dramatic moment of the day when he played audiotapes of Mr. Libby's grand jury testimony in March 2004.  Before doing so, Mr. Fitzgerald meticulously laid the groundwork for his case that Mr. Libby had lied during those appearances. He first presented charts showing that Mr. Libby learned about Ms. Wilson in conversations with several fellow administration officials in June and early July 2003, and that he talked to reporters and other administration officials about her identity in that period.  Jurors then listened as Mr. Libby's voice wafted through the courtroom while he sat silently at the defense table. Mr. Libby was heard to say that he believed he first learned about Ms. Wilson in a conversation with Tim Russert of NBC on Thursday, July 10. Mr. Libby also told the grand jury that he had been taken aback by Mr. Russert's information.  ''You can't be startled about something on Thursday that you told other people about on Monday and Tuesday,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said, referring to conversations Mr. Libby had only days before.  Further, he said, Mr. Russert will testify that his July 10 telephone conversation with Mr. Libby did not include any mention of Ms. Wilson. Mr. Libby, he said, had telephoned instead to complain about a talk show on the network.  ''The evidence will show the conversation he claims took place about Wilson's wife never happened,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. ''And even if it did happen, he couldn't have been surprised.''  Mr. Libby is charged with five felony accounts of lying to the grand jury and to officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who were investigating the leak of Ms. Wilson's name to Mr. Novak.  Ms. Wilson's identity was disclosed just days after her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former ambassador, wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times asserting that the Bush administration, to build its case for war, had distorted intelligence about Iraqi efforts to obtain uranium in Africa.  Mr. Libby had testified that he did not discuss Ms. Wilson's identity with Judith Miller, a former reporter for The Times, or with Matthew Cooper of Time magazine. Ms. Miller and Mr. Cooper testified that Mr. Libby did, in fact, discuss Ms. Wilson with them.  In the trial's opening day, Mr. Fitzgerald's task was to keep the issue before the jury simple: were Mr. Libby's statements about his conversations with reporters true? To that end, he spoke for only about an hour in outlining his case.  The mission of Mr. Wells, in contrast, was to present the case as hopelessly complicated, thus leaving the jurors in doubt about the validity of the charges. Mr. Wells spoke for nearly two and a half hours, ranging over issues of the reliability of memory; Mr. Libby's duties, which during the relevant period included crises in Liberia and Turkey; and threats from Al Qaeda on the days that Mr. Libby spoke to reporters.  But his most startling comment was his assertion that Mr. Libby had become enmeshed in legal difficulty because of White House efforts to protect Mr. Rove.  If Mr. Libby and his lawyers press their strategy of blaming the White House, it could prove risky, possibly even jeopardizing chances of a presidential pardon for Mr. Libby if he is convicted.  Mr. Libby, Mr. Wells said, complained to Vice President Dick Cheney that he was being set up as a fall guy. Mr. Cheney supported that view, Mr. Wells said, and handwrote a note saying, ''Not going to protect one staffer + sacrifice the guy who was asked to stick his neck in the meat grinder because of the incompetence of others.''  This incident appears to have occurred in fall 2003, when Mr. Libby was troubled that Scott McClellan, then the White House press secretary, had publicly said that Mr. Rove had not been involved in the leak but had initially declined to do the same for Mr. Libby and others in the administration. At that time, Mr. Rove had a major role in guiding Mr. Bush's re-election campaign.  Interpreting the vice president's note, Mr. Wells said that ''incompetence'' was a reference to the fact that the C.I.A. had mistakenly allowed the White House to use inaccurate information in Mr. Bush's 2003 State of the Union speech about Iraq's efforts to obtain uranium in Africa. The staff official whom the vice president believed should not be protected, he said, was Mr. Rove. Mr. Libby had been assigned to speak to reporters to straighten out the confusion from Mr. Bush's speech, a chore Mr. Cheney likened to sticking his head in the meat grinder.  Mr. Wells did not, however, make it clear how the efforts to shield Mr. Rove had caused Mr. Libby to become embroiled in the issue, though he suggested that the attention paid to the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's name had obliged Mr. Libby to engage in the perilous task of talking to reporters.  Mr. Wells noted that, in his grand jury appearances and in interviews with the F.B.I., Mr. Libby had also said that he first learned of Ms. Wilson's identity from Mr. Cheney.  The charges against Mr. Libby, Mr. Wells said, amounted to ''a weak, paper-thin circumstantial case about 'he said-she said.' ''",

            "fulltext": "A former spokeswoman for Vice President Dick Cheney gave testimony in the trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr. on Thursday that directly contradicted Mr. Libby's version of events during a crucial period that is at the center of the perjury case against him.  Cathie Martin, Mr. Cheney's former spokeswoman, testified that she had a clear memory of telling both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Libby that a prominent war critic's wife worked for the C.I.A., days before he contends he first learned it from a reporter.  Ms. Martin was the fourth witness for the prosecution in the trial of Mr. Libby, who is charged with lying during an investigation of who leaked the name of the C.I.A. operative, Valerie Wilson. Unlike the previous three witnesses, who worked at the C.I.A. and State Department, Ms. Martin's testimony may prove especially damaging to Mr. Libby because of her perspective as a former insider in the vice president's office and as a former colleague of Mr. Libby. She repeatedly referred to him as Scooter, his nickname.  She testified that both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Libby were intensely interested in Ms. Wilson and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, who had been sent to Africa to investigate reports that Saddam Hussein was trying to buy uranium from Niger for his nuclear weapons program.  Ms. Martin, who no longer works for Mr. Cheney but remains at the White House as a communications assistant to the president, described how Mr. Libby had telephoned a senior Central Intelligence Agency official in her presence sometime in early July and asked about the Wilson trip. She said she was then put on the phone with Bill Harlow, the C.I.A. spokesman, who told her that Mr. Wilson went to Africa on behalf of the agency and that his wife worked there.  She testified that, later that day, in a meeting with Mr. Libby and Mr. Cheney, she related the fact that Mr. Wilson's wife worked at the agency.  Mr. Libby is facing five felony counts that he lied when he told a grand jury and F.B.I. agents that he learned of Ms. Wilson's identity from reporters. Ms. Wilson's identity was first disclosed in a news column by Robert Novak on July 14, 2003, just days after her husband had written a commentary in The New York Times asserting that the Bush administration had distorted intelligence to build the case for invading Iraq.  Ms. Martin's testimony raised difficulties for Mr. Libby's defense in two respects. She bolstered the prosecution's assertion that Mr. Libby was made aware of Ms. Wilson's identity from a number of administration officials. He denied passing her name to two reporters, but those reporters have told a grand jury otherwise.  She also described an incident in which his behavior appeared less than noble. She recounted a senior staff meeting at the White House in which Stephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser, expressed anger after receiving a query from Andrea Mitchell of NBC. Ms. Mitchell had heard that the White House was blaming the C.I.A. for causing the president to inaccurately say in his State of the Union address that the British government had confirmed Iraq's efforts to buy uranium in Africa.  Ms. Martin made it clear earlier on Thursday that it was Mr. Libby who had gone out of his way to take on the task of speaking to Ms. Mitchell about that issue.  But at the July meeting in the White House, she said, Mr. Hadley made a point of turning around and looking directly at her as if to signify he knew she was Ms. Mitchell's source.  Ms. Martin was asked by Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, whether she was, in fact, the source.  ''No,'' she said.  Mr. Fitzgerald asked what Mr. Libby was doing when Mr. Hadley was all but accusing her.  ''He was looking down at the floor,'' she said.  At the end of the meeting, she said, Mr. Hadley took her and other press aides aside and upbraided them further.  Theodore V. Wells Jr., Mr. Libby's chief lawyer, in his cross-examination of Ms. Martin, tried to challenge her memory, as he has done with other witnesses. He noted that she originally told investigators that she spoke to Mr. Harlow sometime after July 7. But she has since acknowledged it must have been earlier because she recognized Mr. Wilson when he appeared on the NBC news program ''Meet the Press'' on July 7 to make his charges about the administration.  Over all, however, Ms. Martin was a self-assured witness whose testimony appeared to have frayed Mr. Libby's version of events. She is also a loyal Republican who was recruited to work for the vice president by Mary Matalin, a close friend of both Mr. Libby and Mr. Cheney.  She is married to Kevin Martin, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and now works as the deputy director of communications for policy and planning for President Bush.  Her cross-examination will continue when the trial resumes Monday. She will be followed on the witness stand by Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.",

            "fulltext": "As White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer was the omnipresent television face of government power, the confident insider who spoke for President Bush and seemed to know everything but reveal only what he chose.  In fact, as Mr. Fleischer disclosed in court testimony on Monday, he only knew what the truly powerful chose to tell him, and sometimes that was not much. On occasion he would pronounce with great authority the administration's position on a topic only to find it had changed and nobody had bothered to let him know.  In July 2003, for example, after Mr. Fleischer had spent months defending a 16-word sentence in the president's State of the Union address asserting that Iraq had sought uranium for nuclear weapons in Africa, he was directed not to repeat his assurances that the information was correct. But his bosses had not yet decided on their revised view.  ''The worst place to stand as press secretary is where the ground is shifting,'' Mr. Fleischer told the jury in the perjury trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff. ''You can't say yes, and you can't say no.''  When pressed by reporters on the issue, he said, ''I basically punted.''  Mr. Fleischer, 46, looking a little balder, a little plumper and a little less commanding than while he served in the White House from 2001 to 2003, often turned to the jury to explain White House ways. But he made a marked contrast with his once-familiar presence as master of administration spin.  In more than two years at the White House, he had deftly avoided saying ''I don't know.'' Now, on the witness stand, it was clear that he often did not know. The job of spokesman placed him in a kind of no man's land between the news media and the policy makers. Sometimes, he suggested, he got no respect from either side.  Mr. Libby, for instance, generally would not tell him much.  ''Mr. Libby was not someone I used as a source in the White House,'' Mr. Fleischer tactfully put it. (The exception was at a farewell lunch with Mr. Libby for the departing Mr. Fleischer -- their first and only one-on-one lunch, he said -- that resulted in his being called as a prosecution witness.)  And reporters, for their part, either challenged what he said or ignored it entirely, Mr. Fleischer testified.  Mr. Fleischer recounted, for instance, how he pulled aside two White House reporters on a presidential trip to Uganda to tell them what he saw as a choice news morsel. Joseph C. Wilson IV, the former ambassador who was attacking the administration as twisting the prewar intelligence on Iraq, had been dispatched to Niger on a fact-finding trip not by Mr. Cheney, as Mr. Wilson had suggested, but by his own wife, Valerie Wilson, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Fleischer told them.  The reporters, David Gregory of NBC News and John Dickerson, then of Time magazine, were unimpressed, Mr. Fleischer recounted.  ''They didn't take out their notebooks,'' he said. ''They didn't ask any follow-up questions. It was a great big 'so what.' ''  This, Mr. Fleischer acknowledged, was not unusual.  ''Like a lot of things I said to the press, it seemed to have no impact,'' he said, provoking loud guffaws from the score of reporters in the courtroom -- including Mr. Dickerson, now with the online magazine Slate.  Mr. Fleischer's description of his experience as chief White House flack -- the journalists' slang for a spokesman -- echoed in some ways the testimony of the previous witness, Cathie Martin, who served as a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney from 2001 to 2004.  Ms. Martin described how she and other ''communicators'' -- that is, press officers and other members of the White House communications staff -- had been excluded from high-level discussions about how George J. Tenet, then the C.I.A. director, would publicly take responsibility for the ''16 words'' on Iraq's quest for uranium. A Harvard Law School graduate, she seemed a bit miffed about the implied humiliation.  ''Everybody was sort of in the dark,'' Ms. Martin testified. Mr. Libby, she added, ''told me there had been a decision not to have communicators involved.''  On another occasion, Ms. Martin told the court, she was ''aggravated'' that Mr. Cheney had directed Mr. Libby to talk to certain reporters and had not given the job to her.  But if the trial is exposing the diminished reality behind the job of White House spokesman, it is also offering an unaccustomed inside look at the news media. When Mr. Dickerson was named in testimony and his mug shot was projected for the jury, all eyes turned toward the man himself, taking notes in a back pew. A wave of whispers passed through the reporters present, and Mr. Dickerson shook his head, uneasy to become the focus of attention.  That moment is only the beginning of what is likely to be an extraordinary excursion by a criminal trial into the work habits and confidential contacts of the Washington press corps. Judith Miller, the former New York Times reporter who was jailed for three months for initially refusing to testify about her contacts with Mr. Libby, is expected to testify as early as Tuesday and to be the first of several high-profile reporters to be questioned on the stand about their work.",

Other potential jurors demonstrated the complications thrown up by the number of journalists, lawyers and officials here.  In the second day of juror screening in the case of the former aide, I. Lewis Libby Jr., a prospective juror testified that he once worked for Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, lived across an alley from Tim Russert of NBC News and went to school with Maureen Dowd of The New York Times.  Mr. Woodward and Mr. Russert are expected to be witnesses at the trial. The prospective juror remained in the pool.  Mr. Libby is charged with lying to a grand jury and F.B.I. agents in an investigation of who leaked to journalists the name of Valerie Wilson, a Central Intelligence Agency operative, in July 2003.  Judge Reggie M. Walton has voiced hope that opening arguments can be given on Monday. But by the end of Wednesday, only 24 jurors had qualified for what is supposed to be a panel of 36 that will then be whittled down to 12 jurors and 4 alternates.  One woman was asked whether she had formed any opinion of the Bush administration that might affect her ability to judge Mr. Libby.  ''I certainly have an opinion that I can't believe any statement by the Bush administration,'' she replied.  Did that extend to Mr. Libby?  ''Yes,'' she said. She was excused.  A woman said she hoped that her belief in the presumption of innocence would overcome her distaste for the administration. But she eventually acknowledged that she might not believe administration witnesses who testified for Mr. Libby. Two people were dismissed on Tuesday after saying they did not trust Mr. Cheney, who will testify for Mr. Libby.  On the other hand, a woman who worked for Lockheed Martin, the military contractor, expressed admiration for the administration on Wednesday and for Mr. Cheney in particular. She stayed in the pool.  A prospective juror who produced reports from Iraq for National Public Radio was excused after testifying that he held Judith Miller, a former reporter for The New York Times, in low esteem for her prewar reports that Iraq had unconventional weapons. He said would not be able to credit her testimony at the trial.  Ms. Miller is expected to testify for the prosecution that Mr. Libby spoke with her about Ms. Wilson. The indictment charges that Mr. Libby falsely said he did not discuss Ms. Wilson with Ms. Miller.  A candidate testified that he regarded Ms. Miller as courageous for going to jail for 85 days for refusing initially to disclose Ms. Libby as a source. That juror, a retired math teacher, also produced laughter when questioned about whether he had problems with Mr. Cheney's credibility. No problems, he said, but he ''wouldn't go hunting with him,'' a reference to Mr. Cheney's accidental shooting of a hunting partner last year. He stayed in the pool.",

With Endy Ch\u00e1vez and Ben Johnson projected as the team's fourth and fifth outfielders, Newhan should receive most of his playing time in the infield or as a pinch-hitter.

If the price is right, the Mets are interested in the right-handers Tomo Ohka and Tony Armas, who know General Manager Omar Minaya from their time together in Montreal.  They are not willing to offer a long-term deal, preferring that Ohka or Armas bridge the gap between the rotation's 40-somethings (Tom Glavine and Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez) and its potential younger members like John Maine, Oliver P\u00e9rez, Mike Pelfrey and Philip Humber.  Ohka would probably cost more than Armas. Okha made $4.53 million last season, and his agent, Jim Masteralexis, said yesterday that he had received some two-year offers. Armas made $2.1 million last year and could probably be acquired for a slight raise.  Neither pitcher had a particularly memorable season last year. Ohka, who will be 31 on March 18, went 4-5 with a 4.82 earned run average for Milwaukee. He missed about three months with a slight injury to his rotator cuff and a hamstring injury. Masteralexis said that Ohka was healthy and training back home in Japan.  ''I've provided the medicals from the Milwaukee Brewers to every team that's requested them,'' Masteralexis said. ''We welcome any examination from a doctor, if we were to go that far with a team down the road.''  Armas, 28, went 9-12 with a 5.03 E.R.A. for Washington, but he still has time to rejuvenate his career.  The Mets are more likely to sign the free-agent outfielder David Newhan, a left-handed hitter who hit .252 with 4 home runs and 18 runs batted in as a reserve outfielder with Baltimore last season. Newhan, 33, would add insurance and, with his versatility, could push for a spot in spring training. Most of the Mets' bench appears to be set; Ram\u00f3n Castro, Endy Ch\u00e1vez, Ben Johnson, Julio Franco and Damion Easley are almost certain to make it. But if the Mets, like last year, keep another reserve player at the start of the season, Newhan would have a greater chance of making the team.  BASEBALL",

The Mets had made it clear that they had little interest in re-signing Floyd, 34, who is known for his powerful bat and upbeat personality. Floyd was hindered by injuries in his four years with the Mets. He played only 97 games last season, hitting .244 with 11 home runs and 44 runs batted in.

The deal carries no guarantees except the opportunity to add a chapter to his once-prominent career.

''This was the first organization to give me an opportunity to be who I am and perform at the major league level. There's still a lot of bullets left in my body, and I'm going to finish everything in Texas.''  Sosa, 38, is fifth on the career list with 588 career home runs, and he remains the only player in major league history with three seasons of 60 or more homers. But the validity of those numbers, like those compiled by the retired slugger Mark McGwire, has come into question. Sosa, McGwire and others are suspected of using steroids in the late 1990s to bolster their home run totals.  Sosa was not asked specifically whether he had used steroids, but he said he was not concerned over a possible tarnished legacy. ''There's a lot of speculation but no evidence,'' Sosa said yesterday. ''I know who I am, and I know the way that I play baseball. And I know that my numbers are there. Numbers don't lie.''  Sosa sat out last season after batting only .221 with 14 home runs and 45 runs batted in over 102 games for Baltimore in 2005. If Sosa makes the Rangers' roster, he will most likely serve as a full- or part-time designated hitter, because Nelson Cruz is projected as the right fielder.

Johnson had one year and $16 million left on his previous contract. The new contract, which goes through the 2008 season, is worth $26 million, so it essentially serves as a one-year extension for about $10 million.  The Yankees included $2 million when they agreed to trade Johnson to the Diamondbacks on Thursday for the veteran right-handed reliever Luis Vizca\u00edno and three prospects.  Starting Thursday afternoon, Johnson and the Diamondbacks had a 72-hour window to negotiate a contract. The deal was completed before the window expired yesterday at 5 p.m. Eastern.  Johnson, 43, has 280 career victories and will probably need two more seasons to reach 300.  For the deal to become official, Johnson must pass a physical today and the trade must be approved by Commissioner Bud Selig because it involves the signing of a new contract.  Johnson had back surgery this off-season to repair a herniated disk. Nero said that Johnson should have no trouble passing the physical but that he was not sure if he would be ready to pitch by opening day.  If Johnson passes the physical, the Diamondbacks will probably have a news conference tomorrow to announce his return.  Johnson pitched for Arizona from 1999 to 2004, then was traded to the Yankees before the 2005 season.  In two uneven years in New York, Johnson had an uneasy relationship with the news media and posted the highest earned run average of his career (5.00 in 2006), though he won 17 games each season.  CAIRO TO RETURN -- The Yankees have come to terms on a one-year, $750,000 contract with infielder Miguel Cairo.  The deal to re-sign Cairo, first reported by The New York Post, should solidify the Yankees' infield for next season.

Thomson was apparently unaware that the Mets and Floyd have parted ways and that Floyd will not be patrolling left field in Shea Stadium next season.  Thomson and Lo Duca have never been teammates. Attempts to reach Lo Duca for comment yesterday were unsuccessful, and an attempt to reach Chris Arnold, Thomson's agent, were to no avail, too.

            "fulltext": "JAMES MURPHY's story may sound familiar to many veterans. At 19, he was drafted by the Army and soon sent to Vietnam, where he was awarded, but never claimed, two Bronze Stars. After a year, he returned home to Stamford, Conn. It was December 1971 and he was physically uninjured, but he had seen close friends die, and he had killed more than one enemy soldier himself.  Mr. Murphy went to work and built a family, and in 1990, he took an early retirement -- at 40, a very early retirement. But like many veterans with idle time, he soon found himself anxious and depressed. He said he started drinking and using drugs, moved away and ended up homeless.  In 2004, family members found Mr. Murphy in the Bronx and persuaded him to visit a Veterans Affairs hospital in West Haven. He was eventually sent to Homes for the Brave in Bridgeport, a transitional home for homeless veterans with mental illness or addiction that offers rehabilitation and vocational training -- the only facility of its kind in the state.  After almost two years there, Mr. Murphy moved back in with his family and took a job at the Errera Community Care Center in West Haven, also run by Veterans Affairs, helping other wayward veterans. This fall, he had his family over for Thanksgiving for the first time in more than 10 years. And six months ago, with the help of Homes from the Brave, he finally received those Bronze Stars.  While Mr. Murphy's tale is particularly hopeful, it is not unique. More and more homeless Connecticut veterans are finding refuge with Homes for the Brave, a three-story, 42-bed, red brick former convent on an otherwise empty street, across from the vacant Park City Hospital and underneath a highway overpass.  ''Homes for the Brave is the last house on this block -- if you miss this house, you're missing a lot of opportunities,'' Mr. Murphy said to other veterans at a holiday party last month. ''We didn't have a home, but this is our home. We have a home now.''  The federal government says veterans account for about a third of the country's homeless population. The Connecticut V.A. sees about 650 new homeless veterans a year, and administrators estimate that at any given time, there are 1,200 to 1,500 homeless vets in the state. But Dr. Laurie Harkness, the director of the Errera Center, which works with Homes for the Brave, those figures are just the tip of the iceberg. ''For every veteran in a shelter, there are probably two more on the streets,'' Dr. Harkness said in an interview. ''The military teaches soldiers to survive in the harshest conditions, so they rarely seek out help.''  Mr. Murphy, 56, said he did not know what post-traumatic stress disorder was until he went to Veterans Affairs and received the diagnosis in 2004. ''A lot of vets in the streets don't know the V.A. exists,'' he said.  Since Homes for the Brave opened in 2002, 362 veterans have come through. To qualify, they must be male, homeless, suffering from mental illness or addiction, able to contribute $50 a week and willing to work at getting back on their feet. They are allowed to stay up to two years, but most leave after one.  Homes for the Brave opened a second, nine-bed permanent residence in Bridgeport in 2005, and organizers are hoping the vacant Park City Hospital will be converted to a permanent home for the elderly with a priority for veterans.  There is a statewide waiting list of 20 to 25 veterans looking for beds, and that number is predicted to rise. Homes for the Brave has already housed a couple of veterans from the war in Iraq, and more are expected.  ''We're going to have to get ready, because we're finding that the Iraq war is causing a lot of problems'' with post-traumatic stress disorder, State Representative Christel H. Truglia of Stamford, who helped secure financing for Homes for the Brave, said at last month's party. ''Our boys are going to be coming home, and they're going to need places like this. We should clone it.''  SHELTER",

The company, and its Babies ''R'' Us division, said it was giving away not one but three prizes in the contest for the first baby born in 2007, including one to Yuki Lin, who arrived at midnight at New York Downtown Hospital in Manhattan.  Yuki had tied with two others: Yadira Esmeralda, born at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, on Long Island; and Jayden Swain of Gainesville, Ga. Yuki was chosen the winner by a drawing from all three names, then was disqualified because the rules excluded babies whose mothers are not legal residents. The prize was then awarded to Jayden.  Now all three babies will get $25,000 bonds. The original decision was reported in The World Journal, a Chinese-language newspaper.  The New York Times reported on the controversy yesterday. Later in the day, the company released a statement apologizing for the tumult.  ''We love all babies,'' the statement said. ''We deeply regret that this sweepstakes became a point of controversy. As a result, we have decided to award all three babies in the grand prize pool a $25,000 savings bond.''  Yuki's parents -- Han Lin and Yan Zhu Liu, both 22-year-old restaurant workers -- declined to be interviewed. But Albert H. Wang, a corporate lawyer who had mounted an e-mail campaign on the couple's behalf, said that they were happy, adding, ''I think justice has been done.''  Some people were concerned that the parents' status had been exposed, he said. ''But the safest place is actually the eye of the storm,'' Mr. Wang said, ''and any politician who says we should deport the parents, it would be the end of their political career.''",

            "fulltext": "FOR years, the noise, vibration and fumes from Long Island Rail Road trains idling on a track siding in the Village of Patchogue have been a nuisance to residents. But after the installation of an automated signal system last May, the idling trains are now virtually in some residents' backyards.  Jack Eddington, a Suffolk County legislator whose district includes Patchogue, said a six-foot chain-link fence is all that separates the trains from the backyards of homeowners on Academy Street.  ''The trains are literally 10 feet from their homes,'' he said.  Ann M. Goodhue, who lives on the opposite side of Academy Street, said she found the ''train situation atrocious.'' She said vibrations from three trains that sat idling on the siding several years ago cracked her second-floor ceiling.  Mr. Eddington said he had been at the siding when two trains were idling and found the noise very loud. ''And they give off a diesel smell,'' he said.  Until several years ago, the siding was about a mile west in a commercial area. Mr. Eddington said complaints from residents were fewer because a lumberyard and a bowling alley were on either side of the tracks and homes were far from the idling trains. But about six years ago, he said, trains were instructed to idle about three-quarters of a mile to the east, ''and it became a general nuisance because it was almost right in the middle of town.''  When a new signal system was installed last May about 200 to 300 feet farther east to align with a switch for the tracks, train engineers were instructed to idle there, said Susan McGowan, a railroad spokeswoman.  Mr. Eddington said that change put the trains ''right along the backyards of 12 or 13 homes'' on Academy Street.  ''I want the railroad to do the right thing'' for the residents, he said. ''I have looked up and down the track, and I see areas that don't have homes. I'm not telling them where they should go, but what I am saying is that where they are now is not acceptable.''  Ms. McGowan said that in an effort to ''minimize the inconvenience,'' the railroad had relocated two of six weekday trains that use the siding. One was moved 10 to 20 feet to the north siding, and a second was moved to a siding in Speonk.  ''These are the first steps we have taken,'' she said. ''We're continuing to look at the situation.''

            "fulltext": "It seemed like a perfect formula for good publicity: A national sweepstakes would award a $25,000 United States savings bond to the first American baby born in 2007, courtesy of the toy chain Toys ''R'' Us and its Babies ''R'' Us division.  Instead, after disqualifying a Chinese-American baby girl born in New York Downtown Hospital at the stroke of midnight on New Year's, the toy company finds itself caught in the glare of the immigration debate, stumbling over the nation's new demographic realities.  The baby girl, Yuki Lin, was an American citizen from the second the ball dropped in Times Square, where the Toys ''R'' Us flagship store draws thousands of shoppers from around the world. But like 6 out of 10 babies born in the city -- including at least two others born in Brooklyn about the same moment -- she has immigrant parents. And according to the contest's fine print, the chain decided, she was ruled out because her mother was not a legal resident.  The first baby of the year is usually a one-day story. But Albert H. Wang, a corporate lawyer who read about Yuki Lin's lost chance on the Web site of the Chinese-language newspaper The World Journal, was outraged enough to start an e-mail campaign that is enlisting the ire of prominent Chinese-Americans like the president of the Asian American Business Development Center and officers of the Organization of Chinese Americans.  Their criticism, and threats of a media campaign against the company, come just a month after the chain opened its first store in China, in Shanghai.  ''They want business from China,'' said Mr. Wang, 39, adding that most of the chain's toys are made by Chinese workers in China. ''But when it comes to this Chinese-American U.S. citizen, she was deprived of $25,000 intended to be used for her college education, because of who her parents are.''  Kathleen Waugh, a spokeswoman for the company, confirmed yesterday that Yuki Lin, born at 6.5 pounds and 19 inches long, had been close to winning the prize. The baby won a random drawing to break a three-way tie with hospitals in Gainesville, Ga., and Bay Shore, N.Y., which also claimed a baby born at midnight.  But, Ms. Waugh added, ''in working with New York Downtown Hospital to verify the potential winner's information and obtain a signed affidavit of eligibility -- which is required under the official rules of the sweepstakes -- the sweepstakes administrator was informed that the mother of the baby born at New York Downtown Hospital was not a legal resident of the United States.'' Contest rules say that only mothers who are legal residents are eligible, Ms. Waugh said, adding that such requirements are common in sweepstakes.  The award went instead to the runner-up in the drawing, Jayden Swain, born 19 seconds after midnight at Northeast Georgia Medical Center to Renee Swain, 20, described by her mother as ''a black American.'' ''She's an American all the way,'' Ms. Swain's mother, Janet K. Keller, said in a telephone interview.  The baby at Bay Shore was born to a couple from El Salvador.  Mr. Wang and other Chinese-Americans say the winner was to be the baby, not the mother, and they see implications of second-class citizenship that strike an ugly chord. It only seemed to add insult to injury, they said, that the baby was instead given a $100 gift basket, just like all the others the chain gives to the first New Year's babies born in any hospital that signs up for it.  ''People are just pretty much outraged,'' said John Wang, president of the 13-year-old Asian American Business Development Center, on Wall Street, adding that he was perplexed by the company's actions.  ''The schools accept children whose parents are illegal aliens in this country, so why is Toys 'R' Us taking this kind of position?'' he asked. ''They're supported by many people, whether they're legal or illegal, shopping in their stores, and they're injecting themselves into this debate.''  The parents could not be reached for comment, and their exact immigration status was unclear. Vanessa Warner, a spokeswoman for New York Downtown Hospital, would not answer questions about the event, though an upbeat account of the birth and photos of the parents and medical team were on the hospital Web site yesterday. The mother is Han Lin and the father is Yan Zhu Liu, both 22-year-old restaurant workers.  Leo Y. Lee, 49, an engineer who is past national vice president of the Organization of Chinese Americans, an advocacy organization, pointed out that the savings bond was awarded in the name of the baby, not the mother, and that there was no legal requirement for a rule barring the American-born child of an illegal immigrant.  ''I am strongly opposed to the Toys 'R' Us decision to give the award to another baby just based solely on the mother's status,'' he said. His group, he said, does not ''condone or approve illegal immigration, but anyone who is here should be protected by law -- especially a baby with the same rights as any other citizen.''  But comments by Ms. Keller, the grandmother of the winning baby, hinted at the wrath that the company risked from the other side at a time when the most stringent critics of illegal immigration have called for an end to birthright citizenship, saying the children born to illegal immigrants are ''anchor babies'' who encourage illegal entry.  ''If she's an illegal alien, that makes the baby illegal,'' said Ms. Keller, 50. Told otherwise, she remarked, ''Sounds like a double standard to me,'' adding, ''She was disqualified -- that should be it. Don't go changing your mind now.''  Adding to the confusion were promotional materials that called for ''all expectant New Year's mothers'' to apply to the contest, and allowed hospitals and Ob/Gyn offices to apply on behalf of their patients. The hospitals were offered a chance to win a $10,000 prenatal education grant. About 8,000 mothers and more than 800 hospitals participated in the contest, Ms. Waugh said.  Ole Pedersen, a spokesman for Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brooklyn, said the hospital initially believed it had won the sweepstakes with the midnight birth of Odunayo Muhammed to a Nigerian immigrant couple, Christiana and Abdul Muhammed. Later he learned that the doctor who reported the birth online had missed the contest's 6 a.m. deadline on Jan. 1 by an hour and a half.  As for a mother's legal status, Mr. Pedersen added, ''We wouldn't have even thought of that.''  Correction:  January 11, 2007, Thursday  An article on Saturday about a controversy over a national sweepstakes awarding a $25,000 savings bond to the first American baby born in 2007 gave an erroneous birth weight in some copies for a Chinese-American girl, born in Manhattan, who was disqualified because her mother was not a legal resident. The girl, Yuki Lin, weighed 6.5 pounds, not 6.5 ounces. (The sponsor of the sweepstakes, Toys ''R'' Us, has since reversed its decision and awarded Yuki and two other babies born shortly after midnight $25,000 each.)",

Natives of Vienna, Toni and her sister Rosi, who survives her, have been valued members of our Steinway Artist family for more than 50 years. A pupil of Emil von Sauer and a recipient of the Fritz Kreisler prize at the State Academy of Music and Art, Toni came to the United States with her sister in 1939. It was in 1940 that the distinguished New York Times critic Olin Downes heard Toni and Rosi play at Steinway Hall, after which he urged them to pursue a career as duo-pianists. From Bach to Casadesus to Consoli to Debussy, to Lutoslawski, Martinu, Mozart, and Starer, among so many others, Toni and Rosi have demonstrated their gift of making familiar music sound fresh, and new music enticing. They performed most recently in Vienna in May of 2006 before an outdoor audience of more than 25,000 on Holocaust Remembrance Day. To Rosi and to her cousin Rose Levy we extend our heartfelt condolences. Toni will be deeply missed. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Acivities",

            "fulltext": "''Quiet on the set,'' bellows Charisse A. Brown, a statuesque actress with a dramatic upsweep of hair, as she paces back and forth in front of her eager young students. She praises one for reading without his script, then admonishes another for going out of character.  The students, aged 13 to 15, are rehearsing a scene from a play they wrote themselves about a young black waitress who dreams of becoming a dancer in the racially polarized 1960s. And for a moment, as the actors fully inhabit their characters -- bursting with personality and moving with a preternatural fluidity -- you could almost forget that they are juvenile detainees in baggy jumpsuits, housed in Woodfield Cottage, a detention center in Valhalla, N.Y., for teenagers facing criminal charges.  Through the efforts of the Westchester Arts Council, Ms. Brown is introducing these troubled teenagers to theater and, more broadly, the transformative power of art. As she shakes the hand of each student at the close of her weekly workshop, her large eyes well with tears after one doesn't want to let go.  ''I have no kids, and I feel a little bit motherly over them,'' Ms. Brown admitted earlier.  The Westchester Arts Council, a nonprofit group with more than 100 affiliate arts organizations in the county, has a roster of artists -- scores of dancers, dramatists, painters and slam poets -- whom it matches with schools, mental-health facilities, day care programs, homeless shelters, elderly centers and the detention center where Ms. Brown holds her workshops. The artists, who are paid $150 for a half day or $300 for a full day, might work with a group for one event or for the whole year.  The teaching-artists program is part of the council's overall effort to make the arts more accessible. ''A lot of people will say that when they hear the words 'museum' and 'performing arts center' that it's both impressive and intimidating,'' said Janet T. Langsam, the executive director of the council. ''This decentralizes some of the arts activities and brings it out in the community. And some of the perception of our being unwelcoming disappears.''  Throughout the region, arts organizations that once conjured up images of landscape exhibitions and chamber music concerts attended by the tweedy set are working hard to take culture, in all its forms, to the broadest possible public.  ''There was a desire to be much more inclusive, to reach out,'' said Ms. Langsam, who is joined in her quest by heads of arts councils in Connecticut and New Jersey and on Long Island -- all inspired by the rapidly changing demographic makeup of the suburbs.  David A. Miller, executive director of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, said 20 percent of the state's residents are foreign born. ''New Jersey may be the most culturally diverse state in the country,'' he said.  In the 1990s, the state council created a folk arts apprenticeship program through which young artists can study under master artists within their culture. To date, the council has financed more than 75 apprenticeships, centering on disciplines as diverse as African-American storytelling and Puerto Rican bomba music, Ukrainian embroidery and Bengali drumming.  More recently, it established six regional folk-life centers, housed in existing museums or arts centers across the state. ''They are important research arms,'' Mr. Miller explained. ''They allow us to reach into areas to find out where the communities live and what their cultural expressions are.''  This winter the New Jersey council is introducing a new grant category, Building Arts Participation. Groups that currently receive operating support from the council are invited to submit proposals for programs and projects that diversify their audiences.  Susan M. Gogan, executive director of WheatonArts, a nonprofit cultural center in Millville, N.J., plans to apply for a grant to pay for a study on the relationship between cultural identity and arts participation. In the past decade, WheatonArts, through its Down Jersey Folklife Center, has worked with 45 ethnic groups in southern New Jersey.  Experience has shown that despite an impressive turnout for one-time events with particular cultural slants, those in attendance have been unlikely to frequent other kinds of programs.  ''One of the points is to define the barriers to participation in our audiences,'' Ms. Gogan said of the study. ''But we also want to identify the barriers within our own organization in terms of how we think about our audiences, how we operate.''  Mr. Miller called the process of diversifying audiences a long-term investment. ''It's largely about making relationships with new communities, and that can take time -- and then it's about trust,'' he said. ''One of the best signs of trust in a community that has felt excluded or on the margins is when they can see that an organization is not only welcoming them into the seats but onto their boards and among their docents.''  FROM Greenwich to Huntington, on Long Island, heads of art programs and institutions have been on something of a tear to diversify their offerings as well as their audiences in an effort to both reflect and celebrate the remarkable influx of cultures that has transformed the suburbs in recent years.  On Long Island, the Huntington Arts Council revitalized its 41-year-old summer arts festival, which features nightly performances in the town's Heckscher Park, by luring new talent. Last summer, in addition to the usual jazz and classical offerings, the council booked Plena Libre, a Grammy-nominated Puerto Rican big band; Samite, a Ugandan-born vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, and Sol y Sombra, a Spanish dance and flamenco company.  Referring to the latest immigrant groups to arrive in sprawling Huntington, Florence L. Dallari, assistant director of the arts council, said: ''It's very hard to get some of these cultures to come to an event. But this summer we saw a big change in the support of people coming to the festival.''  At the Westchester Arts Council's headquarters in White Plains, the current exhibition, ''Folk Arts: Expressions of the Spirit,'' features works by Westchester residents representing a range of traditions and nationalities: Middle Eastern-influenced mosaics by Haifa Bint-Kadi; meticulously rendered Ukrainian pysanky egg painting by Lesia Kozicky; Japanese calligraphy by Yoshiko Katsumi; Indian rangoli floor designs by Kalindi Patel; and Mexican folk altars by Miguel Cossio, to name a few. At an opening reception in December, Los Palalia, a band from Veracruz, Mexico, performed while partygoers noshed on Indian samosas and Chinese pork dumplings.  One of the artists, Ms. Bint-Kadi, who is Palestinian-American, left Pennsylvania several years ago to be closer to the New York arts scene. She settled on Westchester after learning about the resources available through the arts council. They include studio space for rent in its building, as well as workshops with master artists and artist-in-residence positions in local schools.  ''You can definitely see my culture in my work -- I don't hide it,'' said Ms. Bint-Kadi, standing in front of a mosaic depicting the traditional image of the hand warding off the evil eye. ''They celebrated that and said: How can we help you succeed as an artist in a way that makes people appreciate your culture and your art form? An agent wouldn't necessarily do that.''  In Connecticut, the Greenwich Arts Council, a 34-year-old nonprofit organization, has formed partnerships with the New Lebanon Hamilton Avenue public elementary schools, which, despite their location in one of the wealthiest towns in the country, have diverse student bodies. Fifty-five percent of the students at the New Lebanon School, for instance, are Hispanic, and one in four students there are eligible for a free or reduced-price lunch.  In the past three years, dozens of fifth-grade students from both schools have been trained to become docents, or museum tour guides, said Frank Juliano, executive director of the Greenwich Arts Council, which mounts 12 shows a year and produces concerts and theatrical events.  ''We ask them: 'What do you see? How does it make you feel? Where was the artist standing when he did this? Why did he do that?' '' he said. ''Then they take their classmates on a tour with the same kind of questioning, and they come back with their parents. What we teach them is visual literacy -- that there are no right or wrong answers when you are talking about art.''  In November, the arts council presented a Latino storytelling workshop and performances for 300 students from both schools. ''It was an opportunity for kids to see and experience how culture is passed from generation to generation,'' said Gene Nyitray, New Lebanon's principal.  In the spring, the council will send dancers into the schools for a novel ''multiple intelligences'' program, with two eight-week sessions planned for each school. The program is designed to teach math through the use of movement and music, Mr. Juliano said, helping youngsters who are not standard rote learners.  Schools are a special focus for the Westchester council, too, particularly those in less affluent districts. One of Ms. Langsam's first big initiatives when she assumed charge of the council was the procurement of a National Endowment for the Arts grant for $250,000 that allowed it to leverage an additional $750,000. The money enabled the council to place artists in schools in Greenburgh, Mount Vernon, Yonkers, White Plains, Peekskill and New Rochelle, working across the curriculum in subjects that would not, on face value, lend themselves to an arts approach.  ''Sometimes it's an area they're having the most trouble teaching,'' said Joanne Mongelli, deputy director of programs at the arts council. ''So if it's Colonial studies, the children might explore the differences between Colonial Virginia and Colonial New England by doing an ad campaign, working with a writer and videographer.''  Ms. Brown said she had been ''totally booked'' ever since she signed on with the council as a teacher-artist. On Monday, she visits Clear View School Day Treatment Program in Briarcliff Manor, a school for emotionally disturbed children. On Tuesday, she works with elementary-age children in an after-school program in Yonkers on storytelling and public reading. On Wednesday, it's off to Woodfield Cottage, on the same campus as the Westchester County Jail. On Thursday, she returns to Clear View and heads to the Coachman Family Center, a homeless shelter in White Plains, in the evening. On Friday, it's back to Woodfield.  In trying to take the arts to the broadest audiences it can, the Westchester council has shaken up its traditional definitions of art and culture -- a rethinking reflected in Ms. Langsam's approach from the beginning.  In the early 1990s, after accepting the job as executive director, Ms. Langsam, who was formerly president and chief executive of the Boston Center for the Arts, found herself admiring the neatly laid stone walls gracing the roadsides as she drove between White Plains and her new home in Armonk.  Historically the handiwork of European masons, stone work in Westchester is undergoing a resurgence, Ms. Langsam said, thanks to Central and South American craftsmen. So the council secured a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts and created a traveling exhibition called ''Conversations in Stone,'' in which stonemasons used slide presentations to talk about their work to various community groups.  ''It's a way of saying to working-class people that this tradition you're involved in has real cultural value,'' Ms. Langsam said. ''It's about reaching out to people who have culture but don't even know they have it.''",

But the vote also sets up a conflict with the House that is likely to stall any increase.  The Senate bill includes $8.3 billion in tax breaks for small businesses that Democrats who sponsored the bill said were necessary to obtain Republican support.  The 87-to-10 vote on Tuesday was to limit debate on the bill. Democrats say they expect to achieve a similarly wide margin of approval on the final bill.  The House approved a simpler bill, including the wage increase but no tax breaks, this month. The Democratic leaders there insist that it should not be necessary to offer tax breaks in exchange for the wage increase, the first in 10 years.  The two bills would raise the minimum wage $2.10 an hour, from $5.15 to $7.25.  Democratic leaders from both chambers now have to figure out how to reconcile the measures. Assuming that the Senate bill passes, Democratic leaders can hold onto it and negotiate with their House counterparts. Or the Senate can send the bill to the House, which could block consideration of it or strip out the tax breaks and send it back to the Senate for another vote.  In the House, 82 Republicans joined Democrats to approve the wage increase. The Senate rejected the bill without tax breaks.  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said Tuesday that he expected leaders of the two chambers to work out the differences.  ''There are many different ways it can happen,'' Mr. Reid said, although he offered no specifics.  Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to stall the bill by offering dozens of amendments. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chief proponent of the bill, promised to press ahead until the wage increase passes.  ''If they're hoping we'll get tired,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''they're sorely mistaken.''  Republicans, however, insisted that the Senate would not go along with the ''clean'' bill that the House wants.  ''Clean means do it my way,'' said Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, ranking Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. ''That's not how we often do it in the Senate.''  Republicans noted that Democrats went along with a combined package for raising the minimum wage and tax breaks 10 years ago and that President Bill Clinton applauded them for it.  ''And if it was O.K. in 1997, it ought to be O.K. now,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.  Correction:  February 2, 2007, Friday  The headline with an article on Wednesday about a Senate proposal to raise the minimum wage misstated the action taken by senators. By a vote of 87 to 10, the Senate agreed to limit the debate on the bill, clearing the way for a final vote, which resulted in passage yesterday. The Senate did not pass the wage bill on Wednesday.",

            "fulltext": "After campaigning for months on a promise to tighten ethics rules, Senate Democratic leaders tried unsuccessfully Thursday to block a measure that would shine a light on the shadowy practice of earmarking federal money for lawmakers' pet projects.  Last week the House Democrats passed an unexpectedly broad change to their chamber's rules that would disclose the size, purpose and sponsor of any earmark.  But on Thursday, when Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, introduced the same thing in the Senate, Democratic leaders moved quickly to squash it, calling the House bill ill thought out.  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he was happy to see the House ''moving things along very quickly.'' But, Mr. Reid said, ''frankly, I don't think they spent the time on this that we have.''  The Democratic leaders' effort to block the DeMint proposal was defeated by a vote of 51 to 46, surprising almost everyone in the Senate. The outcome reflected the keen desire of many lawmakers to appear to be on the side of openness and reform after an election that turned in part on Congressional corruption scandals.  The reputation of earmarks, which are pet projects individual lawmakers tuck into complicated bills behind the scenes, was tarnished because they figured in several of the scandals. But lawmakers cherished them as a tool of political power used to reward supporters and gain favor with constituents.  On Thursday night, Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said, ''We are continuing to negotiate with Republicans on how to deal with earmark reform.''  Mr. Reid started the week by introducing a bipartisan ethics and lobbying proposal negotiated with the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. It contained a comparatively weak measure on earmarks that would require disclosure of the individual lawmakers sponsoring only a small fraction of them.  The bill excluded all earmarks dispensed through the federal government, including military contracts and civil engineering projects, two of the largest pools of earmarks. It also excluded all earmarks written in the explanatory reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the bills themselves, another broad category.  Mr. Reid offered his own amendment that would ban gifts or trips from lobbyists and the discounted use of corporate jets, but he left the weak earmark provision intact.  Mr. DeMint's amendment to the ethics bill would have eliminated the loopholes and would apparently apply to all earmarks, just as the new House rules do.  After the move to block it failed, Mr. Reid and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, argued vigorously against the measure, saying it could have unintended effects.  ''Earmark disclosure will be a major change in the way the Senate works,'' Mr. Reid said. ''We should adopt the Reid-McConnell version rather than the House version in the DeMint amendment. If we need to revisit the issue later, we can do that.''  Mr. DeMint argued that if the original bill was not strengthened, ''the public's going to know from Day 1 that the idea of being open and transparent is just a scam.''",

But the real test for the 110th Congress will be its willingness to clean up its own act by adopting forceful and credible ethics reform. That is what the Democratic leadership promised voters. Any hesitation will be rightly seen as a cynical re-endorsement of the Capitol's lobbyist-enabling, corruption-steeped business as usual.  Congress's ethics rules have been rife with loopholes and wrist-slapping punishments that grease rather than police the quid pro quo world of Washington. Fixing some of these problems requires nothing more than a majority vote on the House or Senate rules.  House Democrats appear ready to start with a firm, and long needed, ban on gifts, entertainment and junket travel -- including low-cost V.I.P. rides on corporate jets -- arranged by lobbyists or their clients. The ban should cover staffers as well, and the Senate should match it. Even that will require wary monitoring, particularly of a provision that would allow members preapproved day trips for speeches, with travel paid by non-lobbying groups.  Both houses should also bar Congressional alumni and other lobbyists from the debating floors and other Capitol inner sanctums. And members of Congress with other ambitions should be blocked from slyly negotiating lucrative private jobs while they're still on the public's payroll and sworn to defend the public's interest. There should be early disclosure of all job feelers.  The back-scratching closeness of politicians seeking campaign donations and deep-pocket interests seeking favors is a capital disgrace. Part of the solution is to douse their dealings with sunshine through prompt and detailed filing disclosures. And there should be full disclosure of the cornucopia of ''earmarks'' -- costly favors inserted without debate or any requirement to disclose authorship in mammoth spending bills. Earmark authors and beneficiaries should be unmasked in time to be mocked by taxpayers.  Broader reforms will require longer legislative debate, not just a rule change. Paramount is the need to create an independent office for ethics enforcement to end the clubbiness that more often than not covers up or excuses abuses. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered a bipartisan study of this vital proposal by March. We expect this overdue step to receive the forceful support of Ms. Pelosi and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader. The voters are watching, and lawmakers dare not slip away from the promise to clean up their act.  Editorial",

            "fulltext": "The new Democratic leadership in Congress has a chance to finally do what the Republican Congress and the Bush administration failed to do after Sept. 11: to protect the nation's chemical plants from an attack. Lawmakers should stop the Homeland Security Department from adopting new regulations that would block state and local governments from doing more to protect their residents and should pass a federal law with teeth.  An attack on a single plant could release deadly chemicals that could put hundreds of thousands of people at risk of death or serious injury. But since Sept. 11, the chemical industry -- a major campaign contributor -- has managed to ward off any significant new federal rules that might require it to spend money to increase security.  Now it is going a step further by trying to get the federal government to ''pre-empt,'' or invalidate, state and local efforts to impose safety standards. Supporters of pre-emption always claim that they just want a uniform standard. But in situations like this one -- where the federal law is absurdly weak -- it is obvious that the real agenda is to block serious safety measures at every level of government.  Congress wisely refused to include a pre-emption provision in legislation it adopted last year. Now, however, the Homeland Security Department has proposed regulations that would give itself the authority to pre-empt state and local laws. If the proposed regulations were adopted, they could wipe away the serious chemical plant security law that New Jersey has passed, and prevent other states and cities from requiring the chemical industry to do more to protect their residents.  It is up to Congress to act. It should block these deeply flawed regulations and move quickly to pass a comprehensive law that imposes tough requirements on chemical plants to harden their facilities.  Last year Congress passed a bad rider, backed by the industry, that gives the chemical industry far too much leeway to decide on its own how its plants are vulnerable and how to protect them. The new law should contain specific requirements for plant safety. It should also require companies to switch to safer chemicals when the cost is not prohibitive, a key safety measure that the industry has resisted. And it should clearly state that federal chemical-plant laws do not pre-empt state and local laws. Congress should finally put the public's safety ahead of the chemical industry's bottom line.

            "fulltext": "The House voted on Friday to pull the shadowy tradition of Congressional earmarking into the daylight, requiring lawmakers to attach their names to the pet items they slip into spending or tax bills and certify that they have no financial interest in the provisions.  More than any of several ethics rules adopted by the House this week, the earmark measure could prevent the kind of corruption that led to several big scandals in recent years, including former Representative Randy Cunningham's sale of earmarks to government contractors for cash, gifts and campaign contributions.  The cost of earmarks has tripled in the last 12 years, to more than $64 billion annually. Some lawmakers treated their share of that money as personal accounts to dole out to constituents or, in many cases, campaign contributors.  In what lawmakers of both parties called a recognition of the backlash against such corruption in the November elections, the earmark rule the Democrats passed extends far beyond the proposal they introduced last spring and campaigned on in the fall. That proposal applied only to earmarks that are typically already well publicized.  It also goes further than a measure the Republicans passed just weeks before the November election. As in other efforts to change the earmarking process, the Republican leaders foundered against the opposition of the powerful Appropriations Committee, which doles out earmarks as it writes spending bills.  The vote on the new earmark measure was linked to a rule known as ''pay as you go'' that would prohibit the House from increasing the deficit by passing any new tax cuts or entitlement spending programs without offsetting them with spending cuts or tax increases.  Republicans denounced the ''pay as you go'' rule as an excuse for Democrats to increase taxes. ''I call it the Flip Wilson rule,'' said Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana, referring to the comedian whose signature line was, ''The devil made me do it.''  Still, the changes were approved by a vote of 280 to 152, with 48 Republicans joining all 232 Democrats.  On the subject of earmarks, Mr. Pence and several other Republicans commended the Democrats as heeding the message the voters sent at the polls. ''We went through an election where voters were rightfully outraged'' by the practice of earmarking, said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.  In a signal that they, too, had heard the message, the Republican minority incorporated the same changes into the token alternative they proposed before the Democratic majority passed the new House rules.  ''I'm pleased that Democrat leaders agree with Republicans that earmark reform is a critical issue,'' Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said.  Even as the Democrats were passing the strict new disclosure rules, however, at least one influential chairman suggested that he was less than fully committed to the full breadth of their application.  The rules would require lawmakers to disclose their sponsorship of not only spending earmarks but also narrowly focused tax or tariff reductions affecting fewer than 10 companies or people -- something the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee had resisted just as the Appropriations Committee had for spending provisions.  After the vote on Friday on the new rule, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, the new Ways and Means Committee chairman, suggested that such resistance had not disappeared.  ''You have to assume that everything we have done is subject to a revisit,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''We support the speaker and her drive to get things done within 100 hours,'' he said, referring to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But, he added, ''These things are not locked in cement.''  Mr. Rangel and other Democrats also acknowledged that the adoption of the pay-as-you-go rules would force tough choices when it came to delivering on campaign promises like new education subsidies, some of which would fall under the rules.  In particular, the rules will make it more difficult to repair the alternative minimum tax, which, thanks to inflation, penalizes millions of middle-class households as well as its original targets, the rich. Repairing the tax is estimated to cost as much as $1 trillion in lost revenue over 10 years.  Mr. Rangel said he was determined to find $1 trillion of tax revenue elsewhere to pay for the repair, as much as possible by eliminating outdated tax loopholes. ''You have to throw it right in the middle of the tax code and say, 'We are removing this,' and then you have to find the money,'' he said.  In a meeting with reporters, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, promised that Democrats would cut the number of earmarks in half in the next budget, for the 2008 fiscal year. But several Democrats emphasized that the new rules would not alone reduce the amount of earmarks, but could result in more restraint.  Lawmakers already race to take credit for earmarked projects for their districts. But it has often been impossible for outsiders to learn who sponsored earmarks no one took credit for, and unclaimed earmarks were often the ones that played a role in corruption scandals. The new rules will require disclosure of all earmarks in a bill, as well as their sponsors, their purpose and their costs. The rules will also prohibit party leaders from trading earmarks for members' votes.  In contrast to the past opposition of appropriations chairmen, Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who now leads the committee, was a driving force behind the earmark rule, several Democrats involved in the matter said.  Mr. Obey said Friday that over the last 12 years of Republican control the number of earmarks in the labor, health and education spending bill had risen to 3,000, from zero.  ''I think that is a gross exaggeration of what our staffs have the ability to review,'' he said. ''I don't want a single earmark in any bill that the committee staff cannot review to make certain that the reputation of this House and the reputation of the committee are protected.''  In particular, Mr. Obey added the requirement for lawmakers requesting earmarks to clarify that they had no financial interest in the project, to prevent directing taxpayer money toward projects like the beautification of a relative's shopping mall.  Although previous rules already prohibited such self-dealing, ''when a member has to certify publicly, it focuses the mind,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland.  The Senate is expected to take up its own earmark rules next week. The initial proposal, based on a bill that passed the Senate last year but not the House, would apply to only a small fraction of earmarks, excluding those directed to military or other federal contracts, as well as those described in legislative reports instead of bill texts. Several lawmakers, however, have said they hope to strengthen the Senate rules, too.",

Unfortunately, the opposite is true.  Since 2003, I.R.S policy has called for spending less time on any one large corporate audit, with the purported aim of auditing more big businesses. But as The Times's David Cay Johnston reported last week, I.R.S. auditors are being pushed by the agency's top officials to prematurely close audits of large corporations with agreements that they pay only a fraction of the additional taxes that could be collected. Dozens of auditors said they were instructed to limit their examinations to issues that the I.R.S. and the companies agreed to in advance, even if suspicious deductions or other questionable tax tactics emerged during the audit.  Recently released I.R.S statistics -- which the agency is required to disclose, but which it had long withheld -- underscore Mr. Johnston's report. In 2006, the time devoted to each large-company audit was nearly 21 percent below what it was in 2002. From 2003 through 2005, an ever larger share of companies was audited; but in 2006, the share declined from a high of 44 percent in 2005, to 34 percent, about where it was in 2002.  The I.R.S. says its light-touch approach is successful because auditors are finding much more tax owed for each hour they work than they did in 2002. But auditors interviewed by Mr. Johnston dispute that claim. They say that abusive and illegal tax shelters have become so pervasive that it's easy to find additional taxes due. So the overall figure rises, even though companies are being allowed to pay far less than they owe. Economists and tax experts who have looked at the I.R.S. statistics have also raised the possibility that an increase in corporate noncompliance is behind the increased tax-due amounts, not more effective auditing.  Congress must ensure that the agency justifies its policy or changes it.  Editorial",

Republicans, who were attacked by Democrats in the 2006 campaign for accepting annual raises while not increasing the federal minimum wage for 10 years, say they are inclined to oppose any increase for representatives. And Democrats say they are not likely to enact one on their own, which would open them to attack in the next campaign.  Republican leaders point a finger at the hard-hitting Democratic campaign operation of last year, saying Monday that making the raises a political issue violated a longtime unwritten agreement between the parties.  ''It was absolutely understood and agreed to,'' said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the second-ranking Republican.  Mr. Blunt and others said the raises were crucial for members of Congress who are not independently wealthy and must operate two households on the current $165,200 salary. The annual raise for this year was set at 1.7 percent, about $2,760.  Democrats seized on the raise last fall to emphasize the stagnant minimum wage. Both parties backed a provision in a stop-gap spending bill that prohibited any Congressional raises until the minimum wage was increased. That stop-gap measure is due to expire, and the House is set to extend it on Wednesday.  ''We said all along there would be no pay raise until we pass the minimum wage,'' said Brendan Daly, spokesman for the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.  But now that the minimum wage increase is making progress, some lawmakers are considering making their own raise effective June 1 to allow time for a minimum wage bill to be signed into law.  Republican objections appear intended to try to drive a wedge between the Democratic leadership and lawmakers who were hoping for the salary increase.",

Almost every year a lawmaker proposes withholding the automatic annual cost-of-living pay increase from members of Congress in the name of fiscal responsibility and populist reform.  Some members vote for it, but the proposal usually fails. And even the reformers get their raise.  The Senate, at least, may be raising the price of such public displays of self-sacrifice. In the rush to pass a major ethics bill on Jan. 18, the Senate approved a provision that would deny the pay increase to any individual member who voted against it, even if it passed.  Last year, a senator would have lost $3,100 out of a salary of $165,200. (The Senate has delayed taking a pay increase this year until after it finishes debating whether to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time in nearly 10 years.)  The penalty for opposing the raise is the work of Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who called votes against the increase ''the greatest single hypocrisy every year.''  ''All the press releases hit the home state,'' he said in a speech last year introducing the idea. ''And then, of course, it is defeated, and they end up taking the increase anyway.''  The idea is a rare attempt to punish lawmakers financially on the basis of how they vote. Could the Senate, for example, cut a member's pay for a vote to increase the deficit? For one against a new minimum wage?  ''It is a precedent that could lead to a slippery slope,'' said Kenneth A. Gross, an expert on political law. But, he acknowledged, lawmakers voting against a raise ''would have to put their money where their mouth is.''  The Democratic and Republican Senate leaders incorporated the measure into their bipartisan ethics proposal, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 96 to 2 without further discussion.  But in an interview this week a spokesman for the Senate rules committee suggested that a House and Senate conference might revisit the provision before it became law.",

This time the lucky recipients would be small-business owners, who the politicians contend will be unduly harmed by having to pay higher wages. So much for ringing in the new.  It has been more than nine years since the government last increased the federal minimum wage, currently $5.15 an hour. During that period inflation has severely eroded the wage's value. Arguing that it is only fair to cut taxes on business owners when the minimum wage goes up is akin to arguing that taxes should have been raised as the wage fell because of inflation. Instead, as the minimum wage has eroded over the past decade, taxes have been cut sharply.  It's even doubtful that the wage increase under discussion -- a $2.10 increase over roughly two years, to $7.25 -- would impair business. Eighty-six percent of small-business owners surveyed by the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index said the minimum wage had no effect on their businesses.  There's also no reason to believe that the proposed tax cuts would be aimed at employers of low-wage workers. In 2006, when Congress tried to link the minimum wage to tax cuts, the proposals included an estate-tax cut for America's wealthiest families. One proposal now being considered would allow small businesses to write off a larger part of their attorney fees when they go to court to challenge federal regulations. It sounds like a stretch to us that typical employers of minimum-wage workers -- say, restaurants and small factories -- are in any great need of relief from the high cost of federal litigation.  And then there's the probability that tax cuts would cost the government far more than a wage increase would ever cost employers, driving up the budget deficit. The Economic Policy Institute analyzed the tax cuts that were linked to an unsuccessful attempt to raise the minimum wage in 2000. Those cuts would have cost $123 billion over 10 years, versus $11.2 billion for the wage increase.  It's that sort of idiocy the new Congress was elected to stop. Chances are good the House of Representatives will eschew tax cuts and pass a clean bill to raise the minimum wage. The Senate should follow suit. And President Bush should sign it.  Editorial",

            "fulltext": "Stravinsky was arguably the most important composer for dance in the 20th century, beginning with a 1910 commission from Serge Diaghilev to score Michel Fokine's ''Firebird.'' Although Stravinsky wrote only four scores for ballets by George Balanchine, the two artists had a long and mutually fruitful working relationship.  The New York City Ballet paid tribute to that relationship on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater with ''Stravinsky and Balanchine: An Eternal Partnership,'' the first of 10 themed programs of familiar repertory that the company will present in an effort to provide context for the ballets audiences will see this season. (Will the programs also be more marketable? The tribute's slightly odd title does conjure up an image of the eminently practical Stravinsky and Balanchine, who died in 1971 and 1983 respectively, looking down -- or up -- to count the houses.)  The selection of ballets suggests the range of responses Stravinsky's music drew from Balanchine, from the cool, bare-bones complexity of their 1957 ''Agon,'' set to an original score, to the jazzy playfulness and powerful surge of Balanchine's 1972 ''Symphony in Three Movements.''  Balanchine's elegiac moments are seldom among his best. Take ''Duo Concertant,'' a fussy, artificial-looking quartet in which two dancers (Yvonne Borree and Nikolaj H\u00fcbbe) relate unconvincingly to an onstage pianist (Cameron Grant) and violinist (Arturo Delmoni).  Much more believable is the unstressed relationship of dancers to instruments in Balanchine's 1963 ''Movements for Piano and Orchestra,'' now paired in performance with his 1960 ''Monumentum Pro Gesualdo.'' Together they suggest the connections and the distinctions between the more classical and more modern looks of Balanchine's ballets, with ''Monumentum'' delicately pouring out patterns in space for sweetly chaste-looking dancers and ''Movements'' seeming to turn classical traditions on their head, with music to match.  ''Agon'' occupies a central position in Balanchine's oeuvre, a ground-shifting masterpiece in which he and Stravinsky drew from mid-17th-century court dances to create what Balanchine called a ''quintessential contemporary ballet'' that represented a total collaboration with the composer. Harshly astringent at times, sportily athletic at others, the tightly knit ''Agon'' includes one of the most eerily intense and sensuous of pas de deux, danced on Tuesday by Wendy Whelan and Albert Evans.  Not so famous but nearly as arresting is the pas de deux (exquisitely danced by Miranda Weese and Jared Angle) at the heart of ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' a ballet that, like ''Agon'' in a very different way, celebrates the affection Balanchine and Stravinsky felt for America and things American, like jazz dance and music. It is a ballet that pushes excitingly from one climax to another. In the pas de deux Balanchine uses innovative movement -- jagged limbs and lifts of a hunched-over ballerina who looks as if she is seated -- to evoke the intimate love symbolized by the traditional pas de deux.  In the end perhaps ''Eternal Partnership'' suggests most how willing the two, though so meticulous about their crafts, were to be led into each other's beckoning realms.

The first movement is a Neo-Classical romp; the second, a set of quizzical variations on a hymn tune, ''Death, 'Tis a Melancholy Day.'' The finale evokes children at play through prankish musical games: at one point the theme from the spirited finale to Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 6 is revealed to be suspiciously similar to ''Yankee Doodle.''

Then they turn, and Stravinsky's bright fanfare of trumpets heralds the start of the ballet that, in Balanchine's words, used history as ''the takeoff point.''  Stravinsky used a French Baroque dance manual as the basis for his score; Balanchine deployed the academic vocabulary of classical ballet. And yet dance history was changed by ''Agon,'' with its angular, tensile movements that perfectly matched the composer's astringent forays into 12-tone technique.  Audiences must have been hardly able to register visually the compressed, unconventional movement when the ballet had its premiere in 1957; even today the choreography, with its unexpected transitions and acrobatic tension, can surprise, and in the best performances always does.  One of those performances came from an almost all-new cast at the New York City Ballet on Thursday night, when ''Agon'' was danced with a uniformly spiky intensity and a sensitivity to the rhythmic interplay between the music and the movement. Andrew Veyette gave a lovely sinuousness to his ''Sarabande'' solo, and Ellen Bar was coolly seductive in her ''Bransle Gay'' solo and the subsequent pas de trois, balancing unworriedly in arabesque as her two partners switched sides.  But it was Maria Kowroski, more familiar with her part, who electrified the whole work in the pas de deux that is at its heart. With her long, hyper-flexible limbs, Ms. Kowroski can sometimes look unanchored in space, but here every movement was diamond sharp and dazzling. S\u00e9bastien Marcovici, making his debut, partnered with subtlety and skill.  Another explosive performance came at the end of the evening, from Sterling Hyltin, new to her role in ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' and just as riveting. Ms. Hyltin came flying onto the stage with huge, traveling jumps -- Balanchine's jazzy knees-together surprise opener to another major Stravinsky score -- and she often looked as if she might rocket offstage. In a good way.  Amar Ramasar, new to the cryptic yet poignant central pas de deux, worked well with Jennie Somogyi -- curiously sluggish in her solo sections -- and nicely conveyed the wit and humor within the ballet's jagged, lighting-bolt aesthetic.  Also on the all-Stravinsky-Balanchine program was ''Monumentum Pro Gesualdo'' and ''Movements for Piano and Orchestra,'' both authoritatively headed by Charles Askegard and Rebecca Krohn; and ''Duo Concertant,'' in which Nikolaj Hubbe, partnering Yvonne Borree, was a spirited delight.

The latest example was the State Ballet Theater of Russia, the touring name of the Voronezh State Theater of Opera and Ballet, a group formed in 1961. Its presentation of Vladimir Vasiliev's ''Cinderella'' at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center departed liberally from the program's synopsis, based on Nikolai Volkov's 1940s libretto.  A sampling of the characters and props missing from the stage included Cinderella's father, the portrait of her mother, a broom with which she is meant to dance a tender pas de deux, dragonflies in a magic forest, the pumpkin and a jester at the prince's palace. The most bewildering tactic surely had to be when the curtain fell intentionally to signal intermission -- smack dab in the middle of the second-act ball.  Yet for all its awkward moments, as an overall production ''Cinderella'' was full of enchantment. Along with a live orchestra performing Prokofiev's score, lovely scenery by Viktor Volsky and graceful costumes that worked within a vibrant and pastel color scheme by Rafail Volsky, this fairy tale came to life.  There was nothing confusing about the appeal of Svetlana Noskova as Cinderella. With her exquisite feet and gracious performance quality, Ms. Noskova grasped the sweet sincerity of her role. As her attentive, handsome prince, Ivan Alexeev was the archetype of youthful nobility. And Ekaterina Liubikh's Enchantress -- otherwise known as the fairy godmother -- was all refinement.  The rest of the young cast, including the fairies, lacked sufficient strength and stage presence to pull off their variations with the poise of the ballet's leads. Tatiana Sidorova and Alina Taranzhina played the spoiled stepsisters, but as Cinderella's stepmother, Vladislav Ivanov, bronzed and redheaded, was overly broad.  The gnomes, more in keeping with Snow White's seven dwarfs (there were 9 or 10 depending on the scene, but there should have been 12 to represent the hands of a clock), were distractingly thuggish. Here and throughout the ballet Mr. Vasiliev's fussy choreography frequently seemed at odds with the music.  But especially for the dozens of attentive, Cinderella-obsessed young ladies in the audience, including one who turned to flash an ecstatic grin when it was over, the ballet was deliverance. Their girl got the guy in the end and looked pretty doing it. And that counts.  DANCE REVIEW",

Jenifer Ringer returned to the role on Thursday with emblematic, lyrical splendor. Performing opposite Philip Neal as her stiffly dignified Prince D\u00e9sir\u00e9, Ms. Ringer was all loveliness; she is one of those ballerinas who seem to tease and caress the music. In the Rose Adagio she held her attitude poses admirably, finishing with a striking unsupported balance.  On Friday Yvonne Borree was full of gumption as Aurora but lacked the fullness and the strength to keep up with the role's demands. While she began reasonably well, you could sense her confidence and technique faltering; in the Rose Adagio her balances and positions were tenuous.  As the Lilac Fairy, Thursday's cast featured the elegant Teresa Reichlen, who enhanced the role with her natural serenity as well as a newly acquired rigor in her technique. Making a debut in the same role on Friday was Sara Mearns, the image of refined wisdom and plush, velvet expansion.  Maria Kowroski, with her glamour and her flair for deadpan, lent Carabosse, the spurned fairy, a decided bad-girl allure. Melissa Barak, making her debut in the role on Friday, took a more full-bodied approach; her imaginative interpretation was full of wicked zest.  Other debuts included Savannah Lowery as Diamond on Thursday, and Rebecca Krohn the following night. Ms. Krohn lost her footing in a sweeping series of turns, and Ms. Lowery, with more sparkle, had difficulty coordinating her long, strong legs with her upper body.  Making a debut as Princess Florine on Thursday was Sterling Hyltin, who would have been delightful if not for her bizarre, sideways head movements. (Florine is a princess, not a bird, but on Friday Tiler Peck did the same.) Daniel Ulbricht's Bluebird was bristly, but Antonio Carmena on Friday came closer to soaring.  Among the Fairy debuts, Ashley Laracey (Tenderness) and Faye Arthurs (Generosity) held the stage better than most, but 19th-century classicism doesn't come easily to many at City Ballet.  The Danish dancer Nikolaj H\u00fcbbe, as the Prince on Friday in place of an injured Jared Angle, was an impeccable vision of nuanced acting. He, along with Ms. Mearns, was the real beauty.

But Mr. Morris's dances and dancers have almost always looked that way, from the early days at the tiny Dance Theater Workshop to later shows at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The gleaming Mark Morris Dance Center is just across Lafayette Avenue from the academy, and it is there that the company will present a new piece set to Bach's Italian Concerto, as well as ''The Argument,'' ''Sang-Froid'' and ''Love Song Waltzes,'' Tuesday through Saturday. The program and assorted other events are Mr. Morris's way of welcoming in the new year. 3 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (212) 352-3101, mmdg.org; $40.  Christopher d'Amboise's ''Tribute,'' which will be danced by the NEW YORK CITY BALLET for the first time on Saturday night, pays homage to the City Ballet co-founder Lincoln Kirstein in the centenary year of his birth. The ballet will be danced by some of the company's most vivid young performers, dancers of the sort Kirstein would have watched and championed as they progressed through the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, one of his pet projects. It is part of a program called ''Tribute to Kirstein,'' which also includes George Balanchine's ''Episodes'' and ''Vienna Waltzes.''

In a sense, the two pieces are very different: ''2 & 3 Part Inventions'' is an ensemble, created for teenage students at the School of American Ballet; ''A Suite of Dances'' is a solo for Mikhail Baryshnikov, then in his 40s. But both works capture the radiance of spirit and the translucent purity of intention of thoroughbred bodies dedicated to joyous motion.  In ''2 & 3 Part Inventions,'' set to some of the piano exercises Bach wrote for one of his young sons, Mr. Robbins provides an effect of simplicity and playfulness. His choreography is studded with unusual rhythmic dynamics and inconspicuous technical difficulties throughout the 12 sections. And although there are solos and pas de deux, the emphasis is on counterpoint and canon within the group.  On Sunday afternoon the dancers -- Rebecca Krohn, Tyler Angle, Sterling Hyltin, Tiler Peck, Ana Sophia Scheller, Jonathan Stafford, Amar Ramasar and Seth Orza -- paid tribute to Robbins's famous perfectionism with an impeccably polished and charming performance. The equally fine pianist was Nancy McDill, who had played at this work's premiere.  Damian Woetzel was no less charming in ''A Suite of Dances,'' performed to excerpts from Bach's Suites for Solo Cello, played onstage by Ann Kim. The beginning is tentative and inward-looking, as Mr. Woetzel sketches out the steps. By the end, however, he is flirting with the audience, spinning through bravura pirouette sequences and finally cartwheeling into place at the cellist's feet. Mr. Woetzel often seems hesitant about being a star, but there was no doubt about it here.  A young girl doomed to an untimely death is the theme of ''In Memory of ,'' to Berg's Violin Concerto from 1935, beautifully played by Kurt Nikkanen. The ballet can feel formulaic, but Wendy Whelan, tenderly partnered by Seth Orza and threatened by a subtly menacing Charles Askegard, was quietly luminous in the central role.  ''I'm Old Fashioned,'' to a score by Morton Gould, based on a theme by Jerome Kern, is an unabashed crowd pleaser that is also a serious ballet, perhaps a little too serious, as Robbins dissects the lovely duet by Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth, shown on film as the ballet begins, at considerable length.  But Ms. Krohn, Maria Kowroski and Jenifer Ringer, partnered by Mr. Angle, Philip Neal and Stephen Hanna, were just as glamorous as they needed to be, and the showstopping finale -- a plethora of Astaires and Hayworths dancing beneath the film -- is sigh-worthy pleasure. Maurice Kaplow led the orchestra, in fine form.  The New York City Ballet performs through Feb. 25 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com. ''Jerome Robbins: An American Icon'' will be performed again tomorrow night.  DANCE REVIEW",

The NSX was Acura's two-seat halo car, an Asian Ferrari that served as a showcase of technology and innovation. Since its demise, Acura's parent, Honda, has been hard at work on a replacement to keep the performance fires burning.  What they said: ''I must tell you that my own passion is performance,'' Takeo Fukui, president and chief executive of Honda Motor Company, said.  What they didn't say: That this is the next NSX, or that Acura is overdue for something more potent than the brand's current crop of V-6 engines. The next episode in the hunt for NSX V2.0 occurs at the Tokyo auto show, in October 2007.  What makes it tick? The A.S.C.C. has a front-mounted V-10 coupled to sport-tuned version of Acura's all-wheel drive hardware.  How much, how soon?

Some automakers' concepts are nothing but car teases; Honda, bless them, moves its concepts swiftly to showrooms with few changes. Expect the 2008 Accord coupe to strongly resemble this sweet-looking machine.  What's the point? Coupes are staging a comeback, and Honda wants its two-door Accord to lure a good chunk of under-30 buyers. Vastly more extroverted than the previous Accord coupe, the new model harvests styling cues from several of its two-door competitors -- including Nissan and Infiniti.  What they said: Honda executives extolled the Accord's three decades of excellence, but the press conferences' choice of musical accompaniment may have summed up the new model best: ''I'll Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor,'' by the Arctic Monkeys.  What they didn't say: Compelling new coupes like this Accord, and its competitors from Ford, Scion and Nissan, will solidify the Toyota Solara's position as the segment's maiden aunt. The pressure will be on Toyota to swap Solara's flannel-petticoat exterior for something more silken and sexy.  What makes it tick? Honda is being coy on particulars, but the eighth-generation Accord coupe and sedan will certainly continue to offer four- and six-cylinder engines.  How much, how soon?

            "fulltext": "Car seats for infants often fail to withstand the impact when a vehicle is struck by another from the side, according to laboratory tests conducted by Consumer Reports.  Of a dozen models tested in simulations of such impacts, 10 failed, some ''disastrously,'' the magazine reports in its February issue.  The seats have a base that is installed in the car, and a detachable carrier in which the baby is strapped. In the simulations, the seats often separated from the base and skidded across the laboratory, Consumer Reports said.  The seats are rear-facing models of the kind intended for infants up to 1 year old, or about 22 pounds. The government requires manufacturers to test such seats for head-on collisions, but not for broadside crashes, which kill about 30 infants a year in the United States.  It is not clear from the tests how many of those deaths could be avoided with better seats: the magazine tested the seats at 38 miles an hour, the speed at which the government tests cars for protection of adults.  Nicole R. Nason, administrator of the government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the agency was working to develop its own infant-seat tests for broadside crashes. ''We need to move faster,'' Ms. Nason said, though adding, ''I do not want parents to be misled into thinking their children are safer in mommy's arms.''  The magazine also found flaws in a much acclaimed system, required by the government in all new cars since 2002, that helps anchor baby seats to cars. Indeed, some child seats performed worse with this Latch hardware than when held in place by seat belts. The traffic safety agency said it would hold a public meeting next month to discuss how to improve the Latch system.  One seat that failed the magazine's test was the Companion model made by Britax, a product that Consumer Reports, on the basis of frontal impact tests, had previously listed as top-rated. Britax, of Andover, England, sells a better seat in Europe, the magazine said.  Another model, the Evenflo Discovery, even failed a head-on test, the magazine said, and should be recalled. But both the Evenflo Company and the traffic safety agency said the Discovery had passed the government's head-on test.  Robert S. Matteucci, the chief executive of Evenflo, said in a telephone interview that Consumer Reports had so far refused to describe the test method it had used and that small changes in the test could invalidate the results.",

So real that even as the wraps were being taken off the new S.U.V.'s in Detroit, production had already begun in Leipzig, Germany.  What's the point?

But to the horror of some Jeep traditionalists, not all of these new models can climb every mountain and ford every stream.  The company does help buyers tell the difference between the real he-man Jeeps and the emotionally supportive, lifestyle-accessory Jeeps. Real Jeeps designed to go off road get a Trail Rated badge, which means they have been ''designed to perform in a variety of challenging off-road conditions.''  Jeeps without that badge may handle a snowy road, but are really intended for commuting or handling day-to-day chores, like trips to the post office. Taking one of these mail-rated Jeeps on a rough trail will please only the people in the dealership's body shop.  Here's a primer to the changing topography of Jeepland:  COMPASS Compact crossover (base prices of $15,985 to $22,235). Front- or all-wheel drive. How appropriate that something named the Compass should take Jeep in a new direction. This car-based vehicle is not Trail Rated, but aimed at urbanites who want to wallow in the earthy Jeep mystique. While Jeep describes the Wrangler as ''not afraid to get dirty,'' the Compass reflects an attitude of ''I do not care, or dare, to get dirty.'' The Compass shares its underpinnings with the Dodge Caliber.  PATRIOT Compact crossover wagon. ($14,985 to $23,530). Front- or all-wheel drive. A fraternal twin of the Compass, the Patriot looks like a scaled-down version of the classic, upright Cherokee. The Patriot is intended to stay on pavement unless it has an optional off-road package, which earns it a Trail Rated badge. Like the Compass, it is mechanically similar to the Caliber.  WRANGLER Compact S.U.V. ($18,765 to $26,750). Four-wheel drive with a low gear range. Not only Trail Rated, but the most capable Jeep off road (and the least friendly on pavement).  WRANGLER UNLIMITED ($20,410 to $28,895). Rear- or four-wheel drive. A new four-door model, about 20 inches longer than the two-door, with a practical back seat and more cargo room.  LIBERTY Compact S.U.V. ($22,025 to $27,170). Rear- or four-wheel drive. The Liberty was designed for off-road use and is thus Trail Rated. It shares its platform and mechanical systems with the new Dodge Nitro.  GRAND CHEROKEE Midsize S.U.V. ($28,360 to $43,385). Rear- or four-wheel drive. Along with the Ford Explorer, this five-passenger wagon helped to create the boom in family S.U.V.'s in the 1990s, though sales have fallen. With four-wheel drive, it is Trail Rated.  COMMANDER Midsize S.U.V. ($28,610 to $44,670). Rear- or four-wheel drive. Two inches longer than the Grand Cherokee on which it is based.

            "fulltext": "One of the Ford Motor Company's showcase concept cars is the imposing Interceptor sedan, with its big wheels and a burly front end that suggests an armor-plated battering ram.  Lest anybody miss the point, it becomes clear as the car rotates on its turntable for a rear view. There, in brushed aluminum block letters, the license plate reads: MUSCLE, with the ''U'' and the ''S'' in red and blue.  It is a license plate that could easily appear on other cars here, most from Detroit but some from its foreign competitors. As Detroit automakers try to find a winning game plan to reverse their sliding market share, it is clear from the cars on display at the North American International Auto Show here that they are trying to play up a distinct advantage over their Asian and European competitors -- nobody, after all, can design the look of the American muscle car quite like American car companies.  ''It's absolutely legitimate for American producers to reach back into their rich heritage,'' said Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of General Motors. The appeal of Detroit's classic cars also goes well beyond American shores, he added.  ''Even middle-aged Chinese remember seeing secret photographs of Buick Rivieras and Camaros and Mustangs, and they thought, 'Whoa, communism is good, but this looks even better,' '' he said.  But demographics and car buyers' changing tastes may work against Detroit's efforts, say Japanese executives. These cars resonate best with buyers who can remember them -- an aging group -- and they cannot be Detroit's only response, these executives say, if it hopes to end a market share decline under way for a decade.  And, of course, these cars have never been about fuel economy, which has become an overriding issue since gasoline prices spiked last year.  ''Heritage is one play -- but it's not the only play,'' said James Lentz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. He added, ''Eventually, you run out of things in your closet.''  Mr. Lutz, perhaps more than any other executive in Detroit, has pushed strategy and design in the direction of muscle cars. The sculpted sides and hood stripes on a bright orange Camaro convertible concept car instantly bring to mind the Camaros of the past.  A short walk away is the latest incarnation of the Dodge Viper, which almost single-handedly revived interest in Chrysler a decade and a half ago, thanks to a design championed by Mr. Lutz, who was then the No. 2 executive there. This Viper, with a V-10 engine that generates 600 horsepower, looks even more like another Detroit classic, the Chevrolet Corvette.  There is a good chance that some of these cars will be on American roads in a few years. G.M. has already announced plans to build the Camaro hardtop, while Chrysler plans to build the Dodge Challenger, which it showed as a concept car last year.  Chrysler already has a track record with at least one of its muscle cars, the Chrysler 300 sedan, a hit with urban buyers from the moment it hit the market three years go. Though its initial buzz has faded somewhat, the 300C still managed flat sales in 2006 despite a jump in gasoline prices that sent sales of Chrysler's sport utility vehicles plummeting.  Ford's Mustang, meanwhile, has been a rare bright note for the company, which is facing one of the deepest financial crises in its history. Mustang, reincarnated in 2004, rose to 166,530 sales last year, up 3.5 percent.  The Mustang provides the underpinnings for the Interceptor, whose gutsy, low-riding stance immediately says gangster -- a look reinforced inside with its brushed aluminum and black interior.  ''That can only be an American sedan,'' said Mark Fields, the president of Ford's operations for the Americas. ''It's got a rawness to it that is really what we're known for.''  Just to underline the point, a fleet of Mustangs, in red, white and black, is parked nearby. Ford plans to turn out a new Mustang every year in the hope of building on the current car's momentum, Mr. Fields said.  The strategy has its risks, of course. By 2010, when the concept cars on display here may be on sale, more than 50 percent of the American public will be under age 40, far too young to remember when the inspirations for these cars cruised on American roads.  Mr. Fields acknowledged that. ''If you take 10 youngsters and show them that Interceptor, they won't give a hoot about the history,'' he said.  To these younger buyers, classic cars might well be something like the Acura Integra, Honda's original entry-level luxury car from the 1980s, and even Honda Civic coupes, which have become the favorite cars for the customizing crowd.  Young buyers, in fact, have shown an appetite for decking out their cars with custom features like wheel covers, exhaust pipes and contemporary upholstery. Muscle cars, whose exteriors are already a statement, may not give them the chance for self-expression found on vehicles like the Mini Cooper and Toyota's Scion brand cars.  Likewise, Detroit's muscle car strategy may face a threat from Asian companies. The Lexus division of Toyota caused a stir here with its LF-A, a high-performance concept sports car that is every bit as striking as its muscular Detroit rivals.  And Nissan is almost finished with the next version of its muscle car, the 350Z, which went on sale in 2002. That car echoed, but did not directly copy, the first 240Z, introduced in 1970 in the American market.  ''It's very nice to have the heritage of the Z, but we don't want to use the heritage as it was,'' said Shiro Nakamura, senior vice president for design at Nissan. ''We would rather be looking to the future.''  Detroit companies, he said, would be smart to follow a similar path. ''It's O.K. to use American muscle, as long as the idea is original and creative,'' Mr. Nakamura said.  Since they sell in relatively small numbers, muscle cars have always been seen as much as selling tools as products in themselves, drawing buyers to showrooms in hopes they will purchase something, whether or not it is the car they came to see.  ''These are tremendous traffic builders,'' said Michael J. Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation, the nation's largest automobile dealer network.  But a well-crafted muscle car may put a weak lineup in an even dimmer light, canceling out some of its effectiveness. So companies have to pay attention to all their vehicles, not just the hottest looking ones.  ''I want to learn a lot from the spirit of our previous models, but I don't want to use the direct shapes or their design cues,'' Mr. Nakamura said.  American car executives say they are updating, not copying, their original cars as they are also revamping their lineups, hoping all their cars will complement each other.  ''I don't believe in slavish retro cars,'' Mr. Lutz said. The concept works best when ''we carefully go back to a heritage and remind Americans of the glory days of the American automobile industry.''",

            "fulltext": "AT a Detroit auto show press conference last week, Dodge announced that for 2008 the Viper SRT10 would get a boost of 90 horsepower -- to 600, from a mere 510. Some reporters in the crowd might have thought that DaimlerChrysler engineers had at last modernized the Viper's brute-force V-10 engine with dual overhead cams and four-valve cylinder heads.  They would have been wrong.  Instead, they learned, the monstrous Viper engine would continue to breathe through two valves in each cylinder, and those valves would still be opened by pushrods, a venerable mechanism that has all but vanished from modern cars. Still, the Viper V-10 would have a full complement of technology tricks inside, like variable valve timing, which makes it possible to tune the engine for both high power and low emissions with a few computer-controlled adjustments.  High horsepower and high technology usually march in lockstep, advances in performance arriving whenever mechanical innovations permit. Fuel injection, turbochargers and four-valve-per-cylinder designs have all made it possible for automakers to deliver the power that makes drivers reach for their checkbooks, yet remain in compliance with air-quality regulations and often with little penalty in fuel economy.  After the energy squeezes of the 1970s, the future of automobiles seemed to be small -- downsized cars and trucks powered by engines with fewer cylinders and smaller displacements. To compensate for the reduction in brawn, engineers set out to fine-tune the coming generations of engines. Inevitably, producing V-8 power from a four- or six-cylinder engine pushed the engineers in the direction of higher engine speeds -- more revolutions per minute to extract equivalent performance on less fuel.  Of course, imports from Europe, where gasoline has long been expensive, were already using overhead cam engines to extract the best performance from their small size. Moving all the mechanical parts that open and close the valves to the top of the engine -- thus eliminating the pushrods -- yields a stiffer valvetrain that in turn makes it possible to spin the engine faster, a key to maximum power.  Stacking the cams on top of the cylinder head also clears the way for larger, more efficient ports, the pathways that direct gases into and away from the combustion chamber. A third benefit is that operating four valves for each cylinder is impractical with pushrods but a cinch with overhead cams. Doubling the number of valves can improve combustion, lower exhaust emissions and increase mileage.  But bucking this prevailing wisdom has long been a Motor City specialty. Wouldn't you know it, Detroit's seemingly old-tech pushrod engines, also called overhead valve designs, have become horsepower heroes. It's as if the 505-horse V-8 that lets the Corvette Z06 run with Ferraris, the engines in G.M.'s bread-and-butter full-size trucks, Chrysler Group's Hemi V-8, and the Dodge Viper's thundering V-10 never got the memo that pushrods are obsolete.  So why do pushrods persist? Because they are superior in certain areas and inventors keep coming up with fresh ideas to keep them in the game.  Packaging is where the overhead valve engines trounce the overhead cam alternatives. Extra camshafts, and the chains or belts needed to drive them, increase weight, cost and complexity -- but especially size. Pushrod engines, notably V-8's, can fit in spaces that may be too small for an overhead cam design. Because the top of a pushrod engine is so compact, engineers can load the bottom half with larger pistons that sweep through a longer stroke.  As an example, consider two current cars with V-8 engines of about 500-horsepower, the 7-liter Corvette Z06, a classic pushrod design, and the 4.3-liter Ferrari F430, a high-tech dual-cam engine. While the horsepower is similar, the Corvette V-8 produces 470 pound-feet of torque compared with the Ferrari's tepid 343 pound-feet. Torque is what spins the tires when a rambunctious driver tromps the gas pedal, and it's what helps pull a heavy trailer over a mountain pass.  The Viper holsters a magnum V-10 under its low hood. Along with the arrival of new technology deep inside, this engine grows to a strapping 8.4 liters for 2008. Extra camshafts aren't necessary when you've got 10 huge pistons answering every nudge of the throttle.  The challenge is to make large engines seem small and economical at the gas pumps. To do that, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler disable half of the cylinders in some of their V-8s during cruising, when all their muscle isn't required. Cylinder deactivation is easy to accomplish with pushrods, but more difficult with overhead cams.  To coax their pushrod designs to rev higher without running out of breath, engineers have designed lighter, stiffer, lower-friction valvetrains. Pushrod V-8 engines racing in Nascar routinely rev to 9,000 rpm. Thanks to natural trickle-down, the lightweight valves, low-friction lifters and high-tension valve springs made of exotic steels have filtered into production pushrod engines, giving them the speed and stamina to compete with Ferrari's V-8. While the F-430's screaming 8,500 r.p.m. maximum speed is still out of reach, the 7,000-r.p.m. redline of the Corvette outdoes the 6,600-r.p.m. maximum of the Porsche 911 Turbo. The new Viper engine revs to 6,200 r.p.m., 200 more than before.  To fill the cylinders with the air and fuel needed to sustain high-speed operation, Detroit engine designers have packed larger intake ports into the space available between the pushrods. Lacking the room to go wider, engineers increased the capacity of the intake passages by making them taller.  Variable valve timing is another emerging technology that engineers employ to minimize emissions, improve smoothness and enhance power. Changing the timing of specific operations -- when valves open and close in relation to each other and to the position of the pistons -- is not difficult in a dual-cam engine, which controls the intake and exhaust valves independently.  Accomplishing variable valve timing with a single camshaft is a different matter entirely, because the lobes that lift the valves are locked in relation to each other.  Engineers at Dodge, working with the British firm Mechadyne, redesigned the camshaft to create two concentric shafts, one inside the other. The hollow outer tube holds the intake lobes while an inner tube carries the exhaust lobes.  This allows continual adjustment of valve operation, according to the needs of the engine at different speeds.  The cam-within-a-cam concept has existed for decades, but perfecting it for production might just add another decade to the life of the pushrod engine.  DETROIT AUTO SHOW",

            "fulltext": "Introduced on Sunday: Chevrolet Volt design study  Is it real? Not now. Not next year. But General Motors will be ready when the batteries are.  What's the point? Plug-in hybrids have been the buzz among environmentalists, so G.M. set its engineers to building the best possible example -- a theoretical 150-mile-a-gallon car, complete with an onboard generating station.  What they said: ''Here it is, a fully electric-drive car from G.M. I am shocked -- I am truly shocked,'' said Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman of General Motors. ''It proves that environmentally conscious cars can actually look good.''  What they didn't say: This vehicle must wait for the battery of the future, not today's cumbersome and somewhat fragile energy storage systems.  What makes it tick? A small three-cylinder gas engine drives only a 53-kilowatt generator -- it is not connected to the wheels at all. The charge is stored in a long lithium-ion battery pack that runs down the middle of the car. A 160-horsepower electric motor moves the front-wheel-drive Volt, giving 0-60 acceleration of 8.5 seconds and a theoretical range of 640 miles. The car can also be plugged in to a standard wall outlet for a 6.5 hour recharge.  How much, how soon? No production estimates, no prices given. G.M. says the battery technology is expected to be available around 2010.  How's it look? Sleek and coupe-like, the Volt shows some of the design edge that characterizes Cadillac, with the sport sensibility of the Saturn Sky. The Chevrolet bow-tie logo was particularly prominent; one G.M. executive said informally that the Chevy badge was meant to show the Volt was a global concept.",

The 1953 Holden FJ was the original lead sled for Australian hot-rodders. This is an homage to that timeless design. The Efijy was just a show-stopper from the 2005 Sydney Motor Show until someone at General Motors decided it deserved to be seen by a worldwide audience.  What they said: ''I don't see why you couldn't build it for production,'' said its designer, Richard Ferlazzo, head of G.M.'s Holden design studio in Melbourne, Australia. ''It's doable. But that's like, who would have thought that about the Prowler, way back then? By the way, do you know (Prowler designer) Chip Foose? A lot of people here said I should meet him.''  What they didn't say: Though it steered a lot of floor traffic toward the G.M. display, the gorgeous Efijy nevertheless became something of a distraction. During press days, the Holden seemed to always be surrounded by gawkers while mainstream G.M. cars nearby sat like wallflowers at the high school dance.  What makes it tick? Built on a Corvette C5 chassis, it has a 600-horsepower Corvette LS2 V-8 under that grand piano hood.  How much, how soon? If it were priced less than a 'Vette, would you buy one?

So one day -- in three years or three weeks, who can say? -- Linda will have to embark not only on a crash course in elder care, but possibly an exercise in mind-reading as well. Worse, she may face combat with other family members who have other ideas.  I tend to have such conversations a lot lately, as people learn I'm working on a book about families who care for aging parents. Everybody's got a story.  And their stories make me particularly grateful for my father.  He's 84, in reasonably good health and so busy -- between runs to pick up the morning paper for neighbors, volunteer envelope-stuffing, synagogue events and regular poker games -- that my sister and I often have trouble reaching him on the phone. ''Up and around,'' he reports jauntily when I finally get through. ''Can't complain.''  I don't want to canonize my dad. He's not the go-to guy for heartfelt talk about emotional matters. We probably should forswear all debate about the Middle East. And he's so cheap -- though always generous to my sister and me -- that when he and a friend realized they were sending their Discover card payments to the same address, they started mailing them in a single envelope to save postage. (When the company understandably misapplied one's check to the other's account, did they suspend the practice? No, they merely began stapling their checks to their payment stubs, thus preserving an annual savings of $2.34 apiece.) He can, in short, be maddening.  But my father is  admirably clear-eyed about what lies ahead. Several years ago, for no urgent reason except that he's an even bigger believer in ''Be Prepared'' than the Boy Scouts, he and my mother sold their little bungalow with the steep porch steps. They moved into an apartment building with an elevator, and when she developed terminal cancer not long afterward, we were relieved that they had.  Now that Dad's on his own, we've had long discussions about things like someday hiring aides so he can stay in his South Jersey apartment (too isolating, he thinks) versus moving into assisted living. We have even toured a couple of local assisted living places, debating whether one's too spartan, another unnecessarily chandeliered.  At times, I'm aware that his realism has limits. Dad was alarmed by the tiny closet in one of the assisted living apartments. ''I'd have to get rid of a lot of stuff,'' he muttered, most likely imagining his energetic self in this new setting, not a weakened man who may not require an extensive wardrobe.  But he knows he's not immortal. When I drive down to visit, he leads me into the den to show me, once more, the important papers, all signed and witnessed.  One folder holds the advance directive for health care, authorizing me to make ''any and all health care decisions  including decisions to accept or to refuse any treatment,'' if he is unable to make them himself.  In another, he has stored the durable power of attorney that allows my sister and me to handle his financial affairs and ''do whatsoever they think necessary on my behalf'' if he's incapacitated. It also contains his will.  It's startling how few people have taken these steps. Only 29 percent of Americans have drafted a living will or an advance directive, the Pew Research Center reported earlier this year. Even among severely or terminally ill patients, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has found, fewer than half have advance directives in their medical records.  It's not hard to see why. Frailty, disease, ultimately death -- what older person wants to contemplate those? Delay and denial seem preferable.  But consider the consequences of that distaste. I know a Baltimore woman whose mother blithely rejected all such discussion. ''A will is just something for children to fight over,'' she insisted, right through her 80s. Now, Alzheimer's disease makes her no longer competent to sign any legal document, even if she could be persuaded to. Without a power of attorney, her children can't get access to her savings or sell her house to help care for her. Going to court to seek guardianship could cost thousands of dollars better spent for aides and drugs.  When my father falters, I expect to be just as anguished, frightened and overwhelmed. The services and programs available for ailing parents are bewildering and frequently inadequate and the costs daunting; having an advance directive doesn't guarantee better decisions.  But at least I won't have to wonder, or argue with relatives about, what my dad wants, because he has told me. At least I'll have the legal ability to take care of him.  I feel for friends whose otherwise rational elders announce, ''I don't want to talk about it.'' Or who say, ''Just promise you'll never send me to a nursing home,'' a pledge no one without a crystal ball can honestly make. Or even -- a daughter in Rockland County passed this along -- ''I'm not moving anywhere except into your house.'' They're abdicating their roles, forcing their children to be the responsible parties, even before they have to be.  My father probably isn't a popular guy at Discover card, but I see how hard he works to remain the protector, the one who makes the hard calls, the one who spares his children. I don't need his protection any longer, but I deeply appreciate what may turn out to be his final act of parenthood.

            "fulltext": "AT recess, dozens of children tumble into the nurse's office, jackets askew, some with tear-streaked cheeks, fresh from falls and scrapes on the playground at the Thomas A. Edison School.  ''Jason threw me a rock on my head,'' Michael Loja, a 5-year-old kindergartner, said as he sat holding an icepack to his forehead. ''It hurt and it bled.''  On a nearby examining table, Stephanie Gonzalez, an 8-year-old third grader, waited nervously for her flu shot. ''It didn't hurt and I got stickers,'' she said afterward, all smiles, on her way back to class.  The scene in this sunny suite in the basement of Edison, an elementary school, is being replayed daily as one of the newest full-service school health clinics in Westchester County treats not only hundreds of children when they are sick or injured, but also provides checkups, immunizations, obesity counseling and dental care.  In the past two years, school-based health care in the county has grown in popularity at schools the state considers to be in need. While the first elementary school health clinics in Westchester opened 17 years ago in four schools in Yonkers, three more have been added in Mount Vernon and Port Chester since 2005, with another, at Port Chester High School, scheduled to open in April. Mount Vernon and Port Chester are considering opening even more clinics.  ''If we had enough resources and time, I'd like to see school-based health services in every school,'' said Dr. Joshua Lipsman, the county health commissioner. ''It would help keep kids in school, help them learn and help prevent emergency-room visits, drug use and teen pregnancy.''  The clinics provide a safety net for thousands of children in Westchester who otherwise would not have regular health care. In each case, a local health care provider has sponsored the clinics -- writing the grants to pay for them and providing the expertise to license and operate them. St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers, the Mount Vernon Neighborhood Health Center and the Ossining Open Door Medical Center's outpost in Port Chester all compete for the limited funds available from the same federal and state sources. The care is free, but parents must sign up their children.  At Edison, the school nurse and the pediatric nurse practitioner provided by Open Door work side by side. Behind a screen in the large anteroom is a dentist's chair and equipment where the dentist, Dr. Raha Iraj, works one day a week.  Madelin Cruz, another 5-year-old kindergartner, happily clambered up and down from the examining chair after her checkup, clutching a plastic goodie bag with a toothbrush and pamphlets. Two weeks earlier, she had had a dental emergency, an infected tooth that required antibiotics.  ''I liked the dentist,'' Madelin said. ''She told me she would only tickle my teeth, not take them out. And she did just tickle them.''  Edison's principal, Eileen Santiago, said that 70 percent of her students had never seen a dentist before the clinic opened. ''Children were coming to school with Anbesol in their lunchboxes for toothaches because their teeth hadn't been taken care of in so long,'' Dr. Santiago said.  Lorraine Tiezzi, a specialist in school-based primary care at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, said that when parents get to know their school-based clinic, they have peace of mind that their child is being cared for, which helps them to be productive at work.  An Edison kindergartner, Sherley Alonzo, 5, kneeled by the front of the nurse's office, coloring while waiting to go home because she had conjunctivitis. When her father, Edwin Alonzo, 31, came to get her, she buried her face in the leg of his dusty work pants.  ''I think it's wonderful to have a clinic inside here,'' Mr. Alonzo, a mason, said in Spanish. ''If it were just a school nurse calling me, I would be scared, but now I know they are able to take care of problems here, so I know Sherley's O.K. Also I don't have to make separate trips to the doctor and drugstore when I get my child.''  HEALTH",

            "fulltext": "THE news earlier this month about how a New York court treated the dissolution of a gay relationship demonstrates how far gays have come in the struggle for marriage equality and how far we have yet to go. The court held that a separation agreement between two men was binding even though they were not married.  This is an advance over earlier cases in which such agreements were sometimes deemed unenforceable. At the same time, it falls far short of marriage.  The case sounds like a contracts question on the New York Bar Exam. Steven Green and David Gonzalez moved in together in 2001. Over the course of their relationship, Mr. Green, whom the court describes as ''a person of considerable assets and income,'' showered Mr. Gonzalez with gifts, including cars and a ski house.  In 2005, the couple, whose primary residence was in Westchester County, traveled to Massachusetts, which permits resident same-sex couples to marry, and took part in a marriage ceremony on Valentine's Day. But months later, they decided to end their relationship.  In September 2005, the two men signed a written separation agreement under which Mr. Green paid Mr. Gonzalez $780,000 and Mr. Gonzalez transferred the title of the ski house to Mr. Green. More than a year later, when Mr. Gonzalez filed for divorce, Mr. Green sought to rescind the contract. He argued that because there was no marriage, the contract was invalid. Question: Can Mr. Green get his money back?  In responding with a thundering ''no,'' the court answered exactly right. It first observed that the marriage issue was a red herring. Massachusetts only permits resident same-sex couples to marry. As nonresidents, Mr. Green and Mr. Gonzalez's marriage ceremony did not entitle them to recognition in Massachusetts, much less New York.  Mr. Green argued that under contract law, it was enough that he and Mr. Gonzalez believed they were married. (Under the doctrine of ''mutual mistake,'' a contract can be deemed invalid if both parties are laboring under a misapprehension that goes to its heart.) The court rejected this contention as well. It observed that Mr. Green and Mr. Gonzalez never held themselves out to be married in filing taxes or buying property, and that, by Mr. Green's own admission, they had gotten married only ''because it seemed like a nice thing to have, since couples in the gay community are seeking such status.''  The real issue, the court said, was whether separation agreements between unmarried, cohabiting individuals are binding. Under New York law, such contracts are enforceable so long as ''illicit sexual relations were not part of the consideration of the contract.'' In other words, contracts will not be invalidated just because the parties are cohabiting, so long as they do not violate the prohibition on prostitution.  It may seem obvious that a separation agreement is not what used to be called a ''meretricious contract.'' But other courts in other times have deemed contracts between two people who have been sexually involved with each other with suspicion, particularly if the people are of the same sex. In dispensing with the ''meretricious contract'' exception in a footnote, the court properly refused to dignify arguments made under it. It concluded that the contract was enforceable.  I am confident that most courts around the country will get this question right. My only concern about such decisions is their potential to serve as substitutes for same-sex marriage, rather than as stations toward it. Too many people reacted to the New York decision by reaffirming that gays could get all the significant benefits of marriage through contract. This is false.  Gays cannot enter into a contract for benefits bestowed on married couples by third parties. Such benefits include those that the government provides, like immigration rights, custody rights, tax benefits and the various spousal privileges available in litigation. They also include benefits provided by private institutions, like access to a partner's hospital room or coverage under his health plan. And a gay couple, of course, cannot enter a contract with each other for the simple dignity of having the state recognize a commitment between them as a marriage. This seems to be the only count on which Mr. Green was right: marriage is indeed ''a nice thing to have.''  The fiction that gays can get the rights of marriage through contract is pernicious because it permits inertia on the part of those who have incentives to remain inert. As with any civil rights struggle, those in power will be tempted to rest on their laurels. Prior to election, Gov. Eliot Spitzer was an open and ardent supporter of same-sex marriage. His Jan. 3 State of the State address, however, made no reference to the issue, other than the oblique phrase that the civil rights movement in the state ''still has chapters to be written.''  But the final chapter in this struggle must be marriage. And it must be written soon.

            "fulltext": "After two poor months, St. John's has had two very good days.  About 53 hours after beating Syracuse Sunday afternoon, the Red Storm pulled off another upset in the Big East last night at Madison Square Garden. With the freshman Larry Wright breaking a 68-68 tie with a 3-pointer from the right wing with 10 seconds remaining, St. John's defeated No. 22-ranked Notre Dame, 71-68. It was the first victory of the season for St. John's against a ranked team.  This is the same St. John's (12-8, 3-4 Big East) that lost four straight games before the Syracuse victory, was defeated at home earlier this season by Illinois State and was forced into overtime before defeating Boston University.  ''I think they're starting to understand what we need to do to win,'' St. John's Coach Norm Roberts said. ''We've got to play extremely hard and we've got to do the little things. We've got to be fundamentally sound, which we aren't all the time. When you play that hard, you have a chance to win, and that's what we're doing now.''  Colin Falls made one of two free throws for Notre Dame (16-4, 4-3 ) with 40.3 seconds left to tie the score at 68-68. On the next possession, St. John's followed Roberts's instructions and got the ball inside to forward Lamont Hamilton. But Hamilton was double-teamed, so he passed to Wright. Averaging only 3.9 points a game, Wright, a freshman, was an unlikely candidate to have the ball in such an important situation. But he made the most important shot of his college career.  ''It felt really good when it left my hand,'' said Wright, who finished with a season-high 11 points. ''I kind of knew it was good, but when it went in I was kind of shocked. I couldn't believe what had happened.''  After Wright's basket, Notre Dame's Russell Carter missed a shot from well beyond the N.B.A. 3-point line and Hamilton grabbed the rebound to seal the victory.  ''Winning against Syracuse was a big confidence booster for us,'' St. John's guard Eugene Lawrence said. ''We realized what we were capable of doing and what we should've been doing since the beginning of the season.''  Hamilton led St. John's with 23 points, all in the first half. Lawrence had 13 points, but he also had 10 turnovers.  Carter led Notre Dame with a career-high 32 points.  For St. John's, the opening half might have been its best 20 minutes of offensive basketball this season. The Red Storm was in front, 49-41, at the break, led by as many as 14 points during the half and shot 59.3 percent from the field.  Most of the damage was done by Hamilton. At times, it seemed that he could do whatever he pleased inside. He not only had 23 points in the half, he also pulled down 5 rebounds and had 3 steals.  ''In the first half, they were playing man to man and they weren't trapping, so I took advantage of that,'' Hamilton said. ''In the second half, they did a good job of slacking down on me so I made sure I kicked it out.''  Notre Dame started quickly in the second half. Carter scored 9 straight points for Notre Dame to open the half, and his 3-pointer with 16 minutes 30 seconds to go gave the Irish a 50-49 lead.  St. John's finally picked up its first points of the half when Wright hit a 3-pointer with 13:42 to go that tied the game at 52-52. The Red Storm missed its first 10 shots of the half.  Notre Dame has struggled away from its home court all season. The Irish are 14-0 at the Joyce Center and 2-4 elsewhere. The road losses include an 18-point loss to Georgetown and a 15-point loss to Villanova.  Notre Dame learned Monday that point guard Kyle McAlarney would be suspended for the semester for his arrest last month on a marijuana possession charge.  Up next for St. John's is a trip Saturday to Pittsburgh to play the ninth-ranked Panthers, who are considered the class of the Big East.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL",

One Knicks player whose status was not ambiguous was Jared Jeffries, an ineffective starter who played 9 minutes 14 seconds in the past two games. Jeffries, a forward, received a vote of confidence from Thomas, who did not discuss potential lineups other than to say that Jeffries would start against the Heat.  ''He's definitely got to play a little better than what he's playing,'' Thomas said. ''We'll stick with him, and hopefully he'll come out of it. And if not, we have some guys on the bench that are eager to play.''  The Knicks (18-26) will have their hands full even if Curry and Marbury are healthy and Jeffries produces. The Heat defeated them Monday in Miami, 101-83, without O'Neal and Wade, its two best players. If the Knicks lose, they will fall to a season-worst nine games below .500.  O'Neal and Wade returned Wednesday as the Heat (19-23) lost to the Indiana Pacers in overtime, 96-94. Wade was coming off a sprained ankle, and O'Neal had missed the previous 35 games while recovering from knee surgery. O'Neal, who came off the bench and played 14 minutes against the Pacers, will presumably play more against the Knicks.  Asked how effective he thought O'Neal would be Friday, Thomas pointed to the doorway leading to the trainer's room. ''When he stands in that door, he takes up the whole door,'' Thomas said. ''And when he stands in front of somebody, you can't see them. He's a big man, and that's the Shaq effect. It has nothing to do with points and rebounds.''  Defense might not be Curry's specialty, but he seems to be the natural matchup against O'Neal. If Curry is unable to play, it is not clear how Thomas will respond.  ''It would be a huge loss, but we'll get by,'' Thomas said.  Channing Frye would probably join Jeffries at forward. Thomas could go with a big frontcourt by inserting the seldom-used Jerome James or Kelvin Cato at center. Or he could use a smaller frontcourt and have the 6-foot-9 David Lee defend O'Neal. Lee would surrender four inches to O'Neal, but he is bulkier than Frye or Jeffries. The 6-7 Malik Rose, who sometimes guarded O'Neal when he played for the San Antonio Spurs, is another option.  The Knicks may simply rotate several players on O'Neal, spreading their fouls. They may try to wear him down on offense, too.  ''He's coming off an injury, so hopefully we can get out and push the ball in transition and make him run up and down the court,'' Jeffries said.  Jeffries missed 26 of the Knicks' first 30 games because of injury or suspension. He came to the Knicks in the off-season with a reputation as a defensive stopper. But his play this season has been as unsightly as his jump shot.  After practice Thursday, Jeffries said he needed to play with more confidence, an observation he has made before.  ''Whenever I play well, coaches play me,'' Jeffries said.  He added, referring to Thomas: ''So I haven't played well, and really right now he has no reason to play me. I put myself in this position.''  A return to form by Jeffries will be needed, especially if Curry is unavailable. Curry, who has started all 44 games and has been the focal point of the Knicks' offense, had his way inside against the Suns before feeling tightness in his calf during the third quarter. He was injured when he planted his left foot in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter. Curry, who left the game for good, was listed as questionable for Friday.  ''It's kind of hard to gauge it, being I didn't practice,'' said Curry, who initially feared the injury might cost him 15 to 20 games. ''It's kind of painful right now when I step. Try to loosen it up and see what happens.''  Marbury, who was listed as probable, seemed more certain of his status, though Thomas said he would be evaluated again Friday. If healthy, Marbury would probably join Quentin Richardson in the backcourt. Marbury has been playing with pain in his left knee since Dec. 15.  ''I worked out a little bit, did some running,'' Marbury said. ''I felt pretty good.'' He added: ''Yes, I'm playing tomorrow.''  BASKETBALL",

            "fulltext": "The Nets have won four of five games, they are back atop the Atlantic Division and Vince Carter scored 32 points against his former team.  The Nets (15-19) beat the Toronto Raptors, 101-86, at Continental Arena Tuesday night, and got a fine effort from Jason Kidd, who fell two rebounds short of a triple-double, with 10 points and 14 assists.  Earlier in the day, Kidd was the focus of events beyond the court after filing for divorce from his wife, Joumana. ''There are really no distractions,'' he said after the game. ''This is my job, this is my livelihood. So anything personal stays personal and anything that's related to my job stays within my job.''  The Nets moved a half game ahead of the Raptors (15-20) for first place in the Atlantic Division, in which all five teams have losing records.  When the season started last November, not too many people would have picked this game to be a division battle. The Nets have won four of the last five division titles, and the Raptors have a young team that has not accomplished much since Carter left Toronto more than two years ago.  But the Raptors have had some impressive performances against top-flight teams this season, including a 2-point loss to the Phoenix Suns last week. Their future could be bright in part because of their 7-foot rookie forward, Andrea Bargnani, who hit 4 of 7 shots from 3-point range and led the Raptors with 22 points.  Although Bargnani got his looks, the Nets held forward Chris Bosh, the Raptors' best player, to 12 points. Bosh was playing in only his fourth game after missing 12 with a bruised bone in his right foot. The Nets also held Toronto's starting point guard, T. J. Ford, scoreless on 0-for-8 shooting from the field.  Nets forward Mikki Moore, who scored 12 points and had 8 rebounds, said stopping Bosh was a team effort.  ''Everybody shrunk the floor,'' he said. ''We talked. We communicated.''  The all-around effort, especially on defense, has often been absent for the Nets this season, and it has been one of the biggest culprits in their lackadaisical start.  The Nets' fortitude was most evident in the way they sprang back from what could have been a game-changing run by the Raptors.  After the Nets took a 15-0 lead to start the game, the Raptors pulled ahead with a 22-2 run that spanned parts of the first and second quarters and lasted nearly eight minutes. The Nets missed 10 of 11 shots during the stretch and had 6 turnovers.  The Nets answered by giving up only 38 points in the second half. They paid more attention to Bargnani, the first pick in last year's draft, and held him to 6 points after halftime.  ''We're not exactly where we want to be,'' said Nets forward Richard Jefferson, who scored 21 points. ''We understand now that we've dug ourselves a hole. It's a matter now of playing above and beyond to get out of the hole. This was a step in the right direction.''  Carter seemed intent on setting the tone against the team he played with for more than six seasons. The last time the Nets played the Raptors in Toronto, Carter scored only 12 points in a Nets loss. He had 14 points in the first quarter Tuesday night.  Perhaps Carter came out with a message from the Nets power forward Cliff Robinson in mind. Before the game, Carter said, Robinson told the team that it needed to bounce back from a defeat, much the way it did last season. The Nets were coming off a loss to the Cavaliers in Cleveland on Saturday night.  ''By him saying that, it kind of put something in the minds of the guys who are here,'' Carter said. ''We really game out with guns blazing.''  REBOUNDS  Cliff Robinson did not play in the second half because of a back strain that he sustained while bending over earlier in the day. Robinson, who was playing in only his third game after a month and a half absence because of an injured left knee, said he should be ready for Thursday night's game against the Bulls.  The Nets' rookie power forward Josh Boone, who did not play Saturday night after incurring his third migraine headache in three months, said he would have a precautionary magnetic resonance imaging exam in a few weeks.

            "fulltext": "For now, Seton Hall looks like the best Big East basketball team from the state of New Jersey. For the Pirates, that may be as good as it gets the rest of this season.  In front of a small crowd (7,214) at Continental Arena that included an impartial Gov. Jon S. Corzine, Seton Hall defeated interstate rival Rutgers, 77-72, Wednesday night.  The game kicked off the Big East portion of the schedule for Seton Hall and Rutgers, which figures to mean problems for both. Neither team fared particularly well in the nonconference portion of their schedules and must now play much tougher opponents.  Both have first-year coaches and are in a rebuilding mode. Bobby Gonzalez has come over from Manhattan to try to get Seton Hall (9-4, 1-0) back on track. Fred Hill is the new coach at Rutgers (7-7, 0-1).  So far, it is Gonzalez's team that seems to be on the faster track.  ''We don't know how long we are going to stay undefeated in the league, but the bottom line is that we're 9-4 and we won our first Big East game, and it's a rivalry game,'' Gonzalez said. ''Rivalry games are important. We've got to find ways to win games and scratch and claw. That's what we did. That's what we're going to have to do every game. No games this year are going to be easy for us.''  The Pirates have a talented freshman, Eugene Harvey, they can build around. A point guard, he had 21 points for Seton Hall on Wednesday. Brian Laing also had 21.  ''Eugene Harvey makes everyone else on the floor better,'' Hill said. ''Everybody gets worried about Eugene's penetration and that opens up the floor for Laing and Jamar Nutter. He's their catalyst and he makes them go. The better Eugene plays and as he continues to develop and grow, they will develop and grow as a team.''  It appeared early on that Seton Hall was going to run away with the game. The Pirates had a 34-16 lead with 5 minutes 17 seconds to go in the first half.  But the Scarlet Knights went on a 17-0 run to cut the Pirates' lead to 34-33. Rutgers had its first lead, 54-53, on a hook shot by J. R. Inman with 10:11 to go. Seton Hall then started to take control. When Harvey scored on a driving layup with 4:44 to play, the Pirates had a 68-61 lead.  Rutgers was not done. When Hamaday N'Diaye dunked with 1:07 left to go, the Seton Hall lead was down to 68-66. Making 9 of 10 free-throw attempts inside the final minute, Seton Hall was able to close out the game.  Rutgers was led by Inman, who had 18 points and 12 rebounds.  ST. JOHN'S 64, DEPAUL 53 -- Aaron Spears, playing for the first time since serving a four-game suspension, scored all 6 of his points in the final nine and a half minutes and St. John's won a Big East opener at Madison Square Garden.  Daryll Hill, who has battled a knee injury all season, had 9 points for the Red Storm (10-4), including a 3-pointer from deep in the corner as the shot clock ran out for a 59-52 lead with 45 seconds to play.  Wilson Chandler had 15 points for the Blue Demons (9-6).  Hill, who came in averaging 6.5 points a game, and Spears, who was averaging 2.8, combined to score 12 straight points for the Red Storm in the second half.(AP)  NOTRE DAME 78, LOUISVILLE 62 -- Tory Jackson, a freshman point guard, tied a career high with 14 points to help 17th-ranked Notre Dame beat visiting Louisville in a Big East opener. Jackson was put in the starting lineup after Kyle McAlarney was arrested on a marijuana possession charge last week and suspended indefinitely.  Notre Dame (13-1) has won 12 consecutive games for the first time in nearly 33 years. Terrence Williams led Louisville (10-5) with 18 points, but the Cardinals continued to struggle offensively. (AP)  NORTH CAROLINA 102, PENNSYLVANIA 64 -- Tyler Hansbrough and Reyshawn Terry scored 19 points apiece, and No. 2 North Carolina routed visiting Pennsylvania for its 10th straight victory. Wayne Ellington added 17 points for North Carolina (13-1), which used a 27-4 run late in the first half to take command against the Quakers (6-6). (AP)  WEST VIRGINIA 67, VILLANOVA 56 -- Frank Young scored a career-high 25 points, including eight 3-pointers, for No. 25 West Virginia (12-1, 2-0) in a Big East game. Curtis Sumpter, conference's second-leading scorer, led visiting Villanova (10-3, 0-1) with 21 points. (AP)  GEORGE WASHINGTON 70, FORDHAM 59 -- Maureece Rice had 17 points and 6 rebounds to lead George Washington (9-3) past visiting Fordham in the Atlantic 10 opener for both teams. Marcus Stout had 15 points for Fordham (7-6) to give him 1,001 in his career. (AP)  IN OTHER GAMES -- Dan Nwaelele led a balanced offense with 22 points, and No. 20 Air Force (14-1, 1-0 Mountain West Conference) beat Colorado State, 81-75, for its 10th straight victory.  Cliff Hammonds's layup with three seconds left lifted No. 23 Clemson (15-0) past Florida State, 68-66, in the Atlantic Coast Conference opener for both teams. (AP)  WOMEN  MARYLAND 80, NORTH CAROLINA STATE 61 -- Top-ranked Maryland (16-0) opened Atlantic Coast Conference play in the same fashion it handled the nonleague portion of its schedule: with a blowout victory. Laura Harper scored 17 points and Coach Brenda Frese earned her 100th win at Maryland.  Shay Doron scored 10 points to move into second place on the Terps' career scoring list.

            "fulltext": "At the Final Four in Boston last April, the North Carolina women's basketball team saw a night full of promise dissolve into a disquieting mess.  The top-seeded Tar Heels lost in a semifinal to Maryland, which went on to win the national championship against Duke. North Carolina guard Ivory Latta said the flight home was filled with quiet tears.  Weeks and months passed, and Latta refused to watch the film from that game.  But on Friday, as the undefeated Tar Heels prepared for Sunday's game against Maryland, North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell figured the time was right. Her players sat and stomached last season's end.  ''Man, it was depressing,'' Latta said. ''It was very hard to watch.''  But Latta said the film was also helpful. The players noticed simple mistakes they had made and vowed not to repeat them. At the Comcast Center on Sunday, the second-ranked Tar Heels took their long-awaited shot at the No. 3 Terrapins. This time, they walked off the court delighted, with an 84-71 victory that snapped Maryland's 19-game home winning streak before a crowd of 17,950 that was the largest to attend an Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season women's game.  ''Playing against North Carolina, playing against Duke, the revenge factor is so, so big right now,'' said Maryland forward Laura Harper, whose team lost to Duke, 81-62, on Jan. 13. ''They come ready to play us.''  For a time, North Carolina's victory looked as if it would come easily. The Tar Heels (23-0, 7-0) raced to a 20-point second-half lead behind the shooting of Latta, who made six 3-pointers and finished with 32 points.  But Maryland (21-2, 5-2) responded with a furious comeback that was led by the senior guard Shay Doron, who scored 13 of her 19 points in the second half. With 3 minutes 13 seconds left, Doron converted a 15-footer, pulling the Terrapins to 67-66.  ''She just kept putting them up, making shots and all,'' Hatchell said. ''But, you know, that's Maryland; I knew they could score like that.''  The Tar Heels, who entered the game as the nation's top-scoring team, can pounce quickly, too. They closed the game with a 17-5 run, and revenge was theirs.  When Maryland, Duke and North Carolina reached the Final Four last season, it was the first time a conference had placed three teams in the national semifinals; the A.C.C. had never sent more than one.  This season, the three A.C.C. powers have a combined record of 65-2, with the two losses coming within their impressive triumvirate. Maryland plays host to Duke on Feb. 18 but will not face North Carolina again in the regular season. North Carolina plays host to Duke on Feb. 8 before visiting the Blue Devils on Feb. 25.  Sunday's game became a sellout more than two weeks ago. The atmosphere and the national-television audience might have caused some early-game jitters for the Terrapins. Maryland missed 15 of its first 18 field-goal attempts and committed 10 turnovers in the first 10 minutes.  ''Anxiousness, nerves, whatever you want to call it,'' Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. ''But at the same time, we have played on the biggest stage before.''  With 30 seconds remaining in the first half and North Carolina leading, 33-27, Maryland guard Kristi Toliver was hounded by two defenders as she struggled to bring the ball across midcourt. Frese stomped the floor and yelled to a referee, frustrated that a foul had not been called. She received a technical foul, and Latta made both free throws, giving the Tar Heels an 8-point halftime lead. Latta made four 3-pointers in the first 4:50 of the second half, putting North Carolina ahead by 20.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL",

            "fulltext": "The Nets will be without Richard Jefferson, their starting small forward, for about six weeks after he has arthroscopic surgery today to remove loose fragments from his right ankle.  Jefferson is the team's second-leading scorer, and the news comes during one of the Nets' most promising stretches of the season. They beat the Orlando Magic on Saturday night for their ninth victory in 11 games and got back to .500 for the first time in two months.  The Nets (20-20) start a five-game trip to the West on Monday night with a game against the Kings in Sacramento. The trip could be an indicator of what direction the Nets, the leaders of the Atlantic Division, will take for the remainder of the season.  Jefferson, who has been bothered by ankle problems all season, chose to have the surgery now because his ankle was not getting better, said Rod Thorn, the Nets' president. Jefferson took two cortisone shots earlier this season, and Thorn said they were not working. Having the surgery now avoids the possibility of Jefferson's ankle becoming so bad that he would have to miss the rest of the season.  ''He's just not able to do the type things that he can do,'' Thorn said during a telephone interview yesterday. ''He's playing about 50, 55 percent. It's tough for him. He's a young guy, still in the early part of his career. It's mentally a tough situation.''  If Jefferson recovers in six weeks, he should be back by early March, when the Nets have a six-game trip.  Coach Lawrence Frank said his team needed to find a way to cope with Jefferson's absence.  ''Injuries happen throughout the course of the season, so regardless of how you're playing, where you're playing, that's the unfortunate reality of pro sports,'' he said by telephone.  Regardless of who plays in place of Jefferson, Frank added, ''We understand we have to be consistent.''  Jefferson missed five games early in the season after rolling his left ankle, and the second-year swingman Antoine Wright started in his place.  But Wright has fallen out of the rotation and Frank said he was not sure who would replace Jefferson. Frank said matchups could dictate his starting lineup, which may change from game to game.  Jefferson was averaging 16.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists this season, all below his career averages. But he seemed to be battling through the pain and was showing flashes of his usual explosiveness. In a victory against the Knicks on Friday night, he scored 21 points.  Many credited Jefferson's improved play at times for the team's turnaround from an 11-18 record.  Jefferson's problems date to last season's playoffs, when he sprained his right ankle in the second round against the Miami Heat. He tweaked the ankle again in the off-season. The problems with the ankle resurfaced during a game against the Milwaukee Bucks in mid-December. Jefferson sat out the second half of that game because it was sore, and he missed the next game, at Toronto.  Jefferson, 26, has always prided himself on his ability to play through pain, and the nagging injury has frustrated him.  Last month, Jefferson said of his statistics: ''We're looking at some of the lows of my career. It's not acceptable.''  And after Saturday night's game, Jefferson dismissed a question about whether he would make the trip, saying: ''You're not asking me any questions about this. Come on, guys.''  Thorn said he did not believe that Jefferson's ankle problems would threaten his career.  Jefferson will be the fifth Nets player to have surgery this season. The most serious injury has been to their starting center, Nenad Krstic, who will miss the rest of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in late December. Krstic was the Nets' second-leading scorer at the time of his injury.  ''You can't lose players like Richard now, on top of Nenad,'' Thorn said. ''It's going to affect your team, obviously. We are just coming into one of the most difficult periods of our schedule. The players are going to have to play an increased role.''  PRO BASKETBALL",

            "fulltext": "In the excitement of a shootout against the Devils on Tuesday night, a game the Rangers felt they desperately needed to win, Marcel Hossa took the ice as the Rangers' eighth shooter.  He followed a trail of sharpshooting teammates, including Jaromir Jagr, Brendan Shanahan and Martin Straka. But if he was nervous in such a crucial spot, he betrayed none of it.  ''He just looked like the smoothest, coolest guy out there,'' Shanahan said.  As Hossa skated in on Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, he pulled Brodeur wide and calmly fired a shot into the upper left corner, then turned to smile at his teammates, who were celebrating wildly.  One more save by Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist, on Travis Zajac, and the Rangers were celebrating a 3-2 victory over a team that seems to bring out the best in them.  The victory pulled the Rangers (20-17-4) a point closer to the Devils (22-13-4), who lead the Atlantic Division. The Rangers, 4 points behind the Devils in second place, have won three of the teams' four meetings this season.  But the most important part of this one was mental.  Just four days earlier, the Rangers were mired in a seven-game losing streak. They ended it with a home victory Saturday against Washington, but beating a struggling team at home does not offer the same boost in confidence that beating a first-place team on the road does.  And they vanquished the Devils in spectacular fashion.  Lundqvist had stopped all 22 shots he had faced in the Rangers' four shootouts this season, a record that came to a screeching halt when Zach Parise scored on the Devils' first shot. In all, Lundqvist gave up three goals in the shootout. But Brodeur allowed goals to Michael Nylander Shanahan, Matt Cullen and Hossa.  It was the second time this season that Hossa won a shootout for the Rangers; he put a shot through the pads of Flyers goalie Antero Niittymaki in the 13th round on Oct. 7 in Philadelphia.  Hossa has scored only once in regulation this season. His shot against the Flyers, however, helped him climb a few notches up the shootout chart. Hossa said it had also increased his confidence in trying a far more difficult shot against Brodeur.  ''I was thinking I would go five-hole again, but maybe my brother scored too many goals on him five-hole so he would think I was going to do the same,'' Hossa said, laughing, referring to his brother Marian, a star forward for Atlanta who has scored 23 more goals than he has this season. ''This time I did a different thing and it went through.''  The Devils said they were happy to collect a point for taking the game to overtime. Jamie Langenbrunner's power-play goal with 4 minutes 12 seconds left in regulation allowed them to tie the score at 2-2.  ''It was a hard-earned point,'' Devils Coach Claude Julien said. ''We'll take it and move on.''  Langenbrunner had a chance to win the game in the shootout as well, as the Devils' seventh shooter, pulling Lundqvist wide and nearly stuffing in a backhand. But Lundqvist stretched his glove to the right post and nudged the puck aside.  That turn of events allowed Hossa to score the winner.  The Rangers played a solid game to reach the shootout. After falling behind, 1-0, in the first on a goal by John Madden, they came back on goals by Nylander and Petr Prucha before Langenbrunner tied it late.  The remarkable part of Prucha's goal was how the puck got to him. Jagr deflected a pass from defenseman Karel Rachunek with his right skate and sent it to a waiting Prucha, unguarded at the left post.  ''I tried to kick it in the net,'' Jagr said. ''I missed that. I wanted to go top shelf. I'll be working on it tomorrow.''  Shootouts, it seems, have become a specialty for the Rangers, who are now 5-1 in them. And they can turn to their secret weapon when they need to win one.  ''It was a terrific move,'' Renney said of Hossa's shot. ''This is one of the best goalies to ever play the game. Hoss should feel good about himself right about now.''  SLAP SHOTS  Rangers forward Jed Ortmeyer played his first game since doctors found he had a pulmonary embolism in August. He played only nine shifts, for 5 minutes 35 seconds of ice time. Forward Jarkko Immonen was a healthy scratch. ... Devils defenseman Colin White missed his fourth straight game with a groin injury.

            "fulltext": "With three games left before the season's mathematical midpoint, the Knicks' image remains a curious mosaic of contradictions.  After consecutive routs of three of the N.B.A.'s worst teams, Coach Isiah Thomas declared that the Knicks should now be expected to beat the N.B.A.'s worst teams. Then the Charlotte Bobcats came to New York and routed them by 16 points.  Weakened by suspensions and injuries in late December, the Knicks beat three top-tier opponents -- Utah, Chicago and Detroit. Faced with a string of sub-.500 opponents -- Sacramento, the Clippers, Portland, Seattle, Philadelphia and Charlotte -- the Knicks proceeded to go 3-3.  The Knicks have been lauded this season for their resilience. But their loss Friday to the Bobcats left them 2-20 in games they trailed at halftime.  For all the recent flashes of promise, the Knicks are 16-22 -- shaky enough to hold the 11th-best record in the Eastern Conference, but solid enough to be in contention for the Atlantic Division title and a playoff berth.  To put it more simply, the Knicks are a typical rebuilding project, albeit one with a massive payroll and a lot of former lottery picks in the rotation. They are young and inconsistent, teasing their fans with surprising victories and infuriating them with unforgivable defeats.  The Knicks are 11-11 since a 5-11 start, and there are certainly more wild fluctuations to come. The roster finally returned to full strength last week (minus guard Steve Francis, who has always been superfluous), so Thomas is again retooling the rotation and fiddling with the chemistry.  Quentin Richardson appears to be healthy after missing 11 games because of a back injury. He averaged 18 points, 8 rebounds, 3 assists and 2.5 steals in his first two games back, making a strong case to return to the starting lineup. That would force Thomas to send Jamal Crawford, Jared Jeffries or Channing Frye to the bench. The current lineup is 4-5, so Thomas would not be breaking up any magic combinations.  Nate Robinson, the other key player to return last week -- after a 10-game suspension for his role in the Dec. 16 brawl with Denver -- is not yet himself. Robinson vowed to suppress his wilder side, but he also seems to have lost his confident stride. He went scoreless in two games last week, going 0 for 4 from the field in 18 minutes. Yet he still managed to draw a technical foul Friday night. In the 5 minutes 48 seconds he played, Robinson had extensive conversations with two of the three referees.  Thomas had more options last week, but he relied primarily on eight players -- Eddy Curry, Stephon Marbury, David Lee, Jeffries, Frye, Crawford, Richardson and Robinson. Thomas still seems to be searching for the best way to deploy Jeffries and Lee, in particular.  Jeffries was signed last summer to bolster the Knicks' defense, but his lack of scoring punch can be a drag on the offense. Thomas played him just 16 minutes Friday (3 in the second half), preferring to use Richardson (38 minutes) and Lee (27 minutes), despite the Knicks' inability to contain the Bobcats' shooters.  The newly crowded frontcourt rotation has seemed to affect Lee the most. A linchpin of the Knicks' success in the weeks after the brawl, Lee lost some steam last week, averaging only 9 points and 5.5 rebounds in two games. He had been averaging a double-double.  And the Knicks continue to wait for Frye to become a reliable scoring threat. He had 10 points in the first quarter against Charlotte, but only 2 the rest of the night. Thomas continues to start Frye, but often leaves him on the bench in the fourth quarter.  By Feb. 1, the Knicks could just as easily be division leaders or bottom dwellers. Over the next 10 games, they play just four teams with winning records (Washington, Indiana, Phoenix and the Lakers). But they also have two games with the Miami Heat, whose losing record could be offset by the imminent return of Shaquille O'Neal.  PRO BASKETBALL",

            "fulltext": "With the anticipated return of Quentin Richardson and Nate Robinson for Wednesday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden, the Knicks will be at nearly full strength in a season in which they have lost players to injuries and suspensions and often played better while shorthanded.  The question at Monday's practice, as it has been at other times this season, was who would be in the starting lineup Wednesday. Coach Isiah Thomas said that for the immediate future he would stay with the same players who started the final two games of the Knicks' recent trip, lopsided victories against Portland and Seattle.  ''I don't want to prejudge or predetermine anything,'' Thomas said. ''I want to see where everybody's game is at.''  Stephon Marbury, Eddy Curry, Jared Jeffries, Channing Frye and Jamal Crawford started in the victories against Portland and Seattle. Of those five, only Marbury and Curry seem assured of remaining starters, particularly as Richardson weaves his way back into the team's nucleus.  Richardson began the season as the Knicks' starting small forward, because Jeffries was out with a wrist injury, but then missed 11 games with a bad back. Thomas said Richardson would get some time to ''knock the rust off'' his game, as would Robinson, who has finished serving a 10-game suspension for fighting.  Because Richardson is the team's best 3-point shooter and because he can also play shooting guard, he may eventually start in place of Crawford, who can score in bunches and has become adept at lobbing the ball inside to Curry for easy baskets. Richardson plays better defense than Crawford, and he also rebounds well.  During his injury layoff, Richardson was a visible cheerleader on the bench. In one memorable moment, he ran across the court in a suit to embrace Frye after Frye, a second-year forward, made a tying shot during the Knicks' three-overtime victory against Detroit last month. On Monday, he was the proper diplomat, saying, ''My job is to come in and fit in.''  In recent weeks, the most constant lineup question Thomas faced -- and one he will continue to be questioned about -- was why the second-year forward David Lee, who has turned into one of the N.B.A.'s most capable rebounders, was not starting every game. Thomas's response has been to say that he likes the way Lee is playing, but that he believes Lee provides the team with more of a spark when he comes off the bench.  That could change, as could the roles of other players.  ''We'll give it a couple of games and see how it goes,'' said Thomas, who added that he felt good coming off a pair of victories on the West Coast. ''Good and lucky.''  PRO BASKETBALL",

            "fulltext": "Everything the Nets would like to be was wrapped into their 116-115 victory over the Utah Jazz on Monday night.  A team with a dominant star player: Vince Carter scored 33 points, including the winning 3-pointer at the buzzer.  A team with a balanced supporting cast: Eddie House had 19 points, and Antoine Wright and Marcus Williams added 12 each.  A team with resiliency: the Nets fought their way back from 13 points down in the second quarter and from 4 down with less than a minute and a half to play.  And then there was the performance of Jason Kidd, the face of the franchise, who had 22 points, 10 assists and 6 rebounds.  The Nets displayed those characteristics throughout their five-game Western trip, even if they finished with a 2-3 record. Perhaps that is why they seemed to be feeling confident as they headed back to New Jersey early Tuesday morning one game below .500 (22-23).  ''The big thing is that we're not going to quit,'' Kidd said after Monday night's game. ''We're going to play hard.''  If nothing else, this trip will be remembered because four of the five games were decided by a point. The Nets were three defensive stops short of having a nine-game winning streak. The Nets became the first team in N.B.A. history to have five of seven games decided by a point and only the fourth team to lose by a point three games in a row, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  They lost each of the first three games of the trip -- against the Sacramento Kings, the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Clippers -- by a point on their opponent's final shot.  In the fourth game, the Nets played stellar defense against the Denver Nuggets' Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson, two of the league's top three scorers. The Nets won that game, 112-102.  On Monday night, the Nets appeared to be out of it when they were down by 2 points with 5.9 seconds left and with the length of the court to go. But Carter jogged the ball up the court, used a screen from center Mikki Moore and drilled the winning shot from about 10 feet beyond the 3-point line.  ''Sometimes, what comes around goes around,'' Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said. ''And I think our guys deserve a great deal of credit for staying together and fighting the fight, so to speak, and not getting discouraged and not wilting and not letting circumstances determine their behavior.''  Perhaps more than anyone else, Carter seemed motivated by the Nets' early struggles on the trip.  Against the Kings, he scored a season-low 8 points and missed two crucial free throws down the stretch. Against the Warriors, he fouled Baron Davis on a 3-pointer late in the game and was later called for charging. Against the Clippers, he left Cuttino Mobley open for the winning 3-pointer.  After each of those games, Carter put much of the blame on himself and appeared uncharacteristically down.  But he made a renewed commitment to attacking the basket. In the final three games of the trip, Carter averaged 35.3 points and shot 66.1 percent from the field. He also averaged 12 free-throw attempts a game, evidence of his aggressiveness in the paint.  ''At the beginning of the trip, each individual had to step their game up, and I felt I had to do the same,'' Carter said Monday night. ''I felt that in the first three games, regardless of points, I didn't deliver because we didn't win the game. I'm just glad I could do it for my team.''  Carter is playing his best at a time when he is the subject of many trade rumors. Although the Nets' president, Rod Thorn, has said that players are worth more in trades when they are playing well, Carter might be making him think twice about any such decision.  The Nets also need Carter more than ever because they are without small forward Richard Jefferson, who missed the trip because of ankle surgery that could keep him out until early March. Jefferson was the Nets' second-leading scorer before he was injured.  Another good sign for the Nets was that their bench helped lift the burden of not having Jefferson. In each game, a different reserve stepped forward.  The rookie Hassan Adams took Jefferson's place in the starting lineup for the first three games, and Wright started the last two. Both were called on for their defense, and they delivered.  Wright was especially impressive. Before starting Saturday night's game against the Nuggets, he had not played in 12 of the previous 19 games. But he scored 11 points and slowed Anthony.  The reserve forward Bostjan Nachbar was averaging 17.7 points over a three-game stretch but became ill before the Jazz game and did not play. So House stepped in with his 19-point effort.  Moore had a fitting description for what these all-around contributions said about the Nets: ''We're a team.''  PRO BASKETBALL",

            "fulltext": "A young, rebuilding Rutgers team might have learned something Wednesday night. It probably is not going to win a jump-shooting contest.  Against the Syracuse zone defense, Rutgers could do little else but shoot long-range jumpers, a strategy that failed. Hitting 18 of 61 shots (29.5 percent) from the field and scoring just 20 points in the paint, the Scarlet Knights were no match for Syracuse, losing by 68-58.  Only the reserve guard Courtney Nelson, who led Rutgers with 14 points, seemed to be in any rhythm for the Scarlet Knights (8-8, 1-2 Big East). But he made only 3 of 9 field-goal attempts.  ''I thought we did a good job of getting the ball inside, but, of course, any time you see a zone you've got to make shots,'' Rutgers Coach Fred Hill said. ''There are a lot of different ways to attack a zone, but you've got to make shots to loosen things up a bit. We got some great looks, but they didn't go down.''  The Orange (13-4, 2-1 Big East) offered a far more diverse attack. Shooting 46.9 percent, they got solid interior play from Darryl Watkins (9 points, 10 rebounds) and Demetris Nichols (12 points, 7 rebounds), as well as good perimeter shooting from guard Eric Devendorf, who led all scorers with 19 points.  ''These games are made for Eric,'' Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. ''Teams will go way out with their defense. That creates space for him to get to the basket.''  The Orange also helped itself at the free-throw line, making 18 of 21 attempts.  Rutgers was cold throughout, making 9 of 32 field-goal attempts during an opening half that ended with Syracuse leading, 28-25. Ten Syracuse turnovers helped Rutgers stay close.  The Orange got an immediate lift from an unlikely source. Guard Andy Rautins, who was averaging 5 points a game, scored 9 of Syracuse's first 11 points. He did not score again.  Syracuse took control early in the second half. A dunk by Nichols with 16 minutes 4 seconds left extended the lead to 39-30, and for Rutgers, it would only get worse. When Roberts dunked with 4:55 to go, the Orange had a 60-43 lead. Rutgers cut the deficit in the closing minutes, and when Marquis Webb scored on a putback with 54.4 seconds left, the lead was 6 points. Nichols responded by making a pair of free throws, and seconds later, Devendorf sealed the game by making two more free throws.  ''The shots weren't falling,'' Rutgers forward J. R. Inman said. ''It just wasn't outside. We were missing midrange and a lot of shots we usually hit. It was an adjustment for us. We haven't played a team that big down low. When you see a zone and with a lot of big, athletic guys, it's hard to adjust.''  The loss came just four days after Rutgers played what might have been its best game of the season, a 54-42 victory at Cincinnati. The 42 points were the fewest scored against Rutgers by a Big East opponent.  The Orange have beaten Rutgers six straight times, which includes an 86-84 overtime victory last season at the Carrier Dome. Three of Syracuse's four losses have come against teams that were ranked at the time.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL",

            "fulltext": "As fighting began to flare Sunday around Kismayo, in southern Somalia, the final redoubt for the country's diminished Islamic movement, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.  Muhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.  ''We told them that they were going to lose,'' Mr. Arab said, ''and that our city would get destroyed.''  Kismayo, a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the East African spice empire, has been spared the fighting so far. But the Islamists, Mr. Arab said, did not care. ''These guys are bent on war,'' he said.  The fighting started around 5 p.m., with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib, a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo.  [Residents of Kismayo told Reuters Monday that Somali Islamists fled overnight from their final stronghold around the southern port of the city. Several thousand Somalia Islamic Courts Council fighters had been making a last stand north of Kismayo port, but residents said they melted away after the advancing Ethiopian force began its shelling of Jilib. Somalia's interim government vowed to pursue them.]  As the shells began to rain down in Jilib, residents said, clan militias in Kismayo turned on the Islamists.  That set off running gun battles across the city, with several people reported killed. It also accelerated the exodus from Kismayo, with thousands of residents hastily gathering a few belongings and joining the stream of people fleeing the fighting in southern Somalia.  It is hard to predict what is going to happen next. Local support for the Islamists in Kismayo is obviously evaporating, just as it did last week in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, when clan elders decided that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.  That led to the city falling much faster than anyone expected into the hands of Somalia's transitional government, which has used Ethiopian troops and airpower to reclaim much of the country. Clan elders are the pillars of Somali society, and many of the Islamist fighters in Mogadishu were clan militiamen lent to the movement.  But the fighters in Kismayo may be different. Kismayo is where the Islamist leadership fled after losing Mogadishu, taking their most steadfast and hard-core fighters.  Ethiopian officials have said that the Somali Islamists are bolstered by several thousand foreign fighters -- from Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Libya and Eritrea, Ethiopia's bitter enemy, though American intelligence officials have said that the numbers are far fewer, most likely in the hundreds.  Diplomats are still searching for a way to avert disaster. On Sunday, Kenyan officials, with American encouragement, continued to meet in Nairobi with the few remaining moderate leaders of the Islamist movement in an effort to reach a cease-fire. But the talks were slow-going, said an official close to the parties.  In Mogadishu, the transitional prime minister, Ali Mohammed Gedi, seems to relish his newfound authority. Mr. Gedi, a bookish veterinarian whom few Somalis would have recognized before last week's stunning comeback by the transitional government, is holding daily news conferences, meeting with clan elders and surveying bombed-out buildings for future office space. On Sunday, he reassured the populace in confident tones that the era of warlord rule was over.",

            "fulltext": "Kenyan officials announced Wednesday that they were closing their northern border because of the conflict in Somalia, but denied that they had turned back hundreds of refugees.  For the past few days, Ethiopian-led forces have been hunting down the remnants of Somalia's once powerful Islamist movement, pushing fighters steadily south toward the Kenyan border. Ethiopian officials have said the Islamist fighters are headed to a remote jungle outpost called Ras Kamboni, which terrorism suspects have used before as a hide-out.  It now seems that Somalia's problems have sucked in yet another country, and with the final throes of the conflict on their doorstep, Kenyan officials said they had no choice but to act.  ''We needed to close the border so we could closely vet all refugees,'' said Alfred N. Mutua, a spokesman for the Kenyan government.  But Mr. Mutua denied news reports and accusations from United Nations officials that Kenyan border guards had deported 600 Somalis seeking asylum, saying that the closing applied only to cross-border trade and nonrefugee traffic, to prevent the Islamists from slipping into the country.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday that Kenya ''has a humanitarian obligation to allow civilians at risk to seek asylum on its territory.''  Mr. Mutua said that 10 foreign Islamist fighters were caught Monday trying to cross the border in a throng of refugees. The fighters were carrying briefcases packed with cash. Kenyan officials said they probably had been financiers of Somalia's Islamist movement, which was routed last week by Ethiopian soldiers supporting Somalia's transitional government.  As hundreds of Somalis continue to line up at the border each day, hoping for asylum, Kenya has buttressed its patrols with extra troops and helicopters. Residents on the Kenyan side of the border have reported skirmishes in Kenya, but Mr. Mutua said that was not the case.  ''We're just trying to make sure none of the problems from Somalia spill across the border, and so far none has,'' he said.  In Mogadishu, Somalia's battle-scarred capital, several weapons were collected Wednesday in the transitional government's drive to disarm one of the most heavily armed citizenries in the world. On Monday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, the transitional prime minister, issued one of his first edicts, demanding that Somali warlords and gunmen turn in their military-grade weapons by Thursday. If they did not, he said, homes would be searched.  Elders from one of Mogadishu's more powerful subclans turned over a pickup truck equipped with an antiaircraft gun and 20 young fighters. Transitional government officials said the weapons and men would be folded into Somalia's new national army.  Meanwhile, Islamist leaders continued to insist that they had not been defeated.  ''I cannot say where we are, but we are in Somalia and we are not afraid anymore,'' Abdulrahim Ali Modei, the Islamists' spokesman, said Wednesday in a telephone call to a Somali radio station.",

            "fulltext": "The second in command of Somalia's defeated Islamist forces has surrendered to the Kenyan authorities and is staying at a hotel in Nairobi, Western diplomats and Somali officials said Monday.  Sheik Sharif Ahmed, the head of the Islamic Courts Union executive council, was part of a group of Islamist leaders being hunted down by American and Ethiopian troops in southern Somalia. Described as a moderate Muslim and potential peacemaker, he surfaced at the Kenya-Somalia border in the past week, Somali officials said, and now the Kenyan immigration authorities are deliberating about what to do with him.  ''Sheik Sharif is in Nairobi,'' said Abdirahman Dinari, spokesman for Somalia's transitional government. ''We are waiting for the next move.''  Several Western diplomats said American officials, who have urged Somalia's newly empowered government to reconcile with moderate Islamist leaders, were instrumental in arranging Mr. Ahmed's safe passage to Kenya.  ''He decided to come to Kenya only after getting a guarantee from the Americans that he would not be deported'' back to Somalia, said a Western diplomat in Nairobi who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He's been here a week.''  Over the weekend, the BBC broadcast an interview with Michael E. Ranneberger, the American ambassador to Kenya, in which Mr. Ranneberger said, ''We certainly have made clear to the T.F.G.,'' Somalia's transitional federal government, ''that it needs to talk to all elements, and that includes people such as, for example, Sheik Sharif.''  At that point, Mr. Ahmed, a school-teacher turned religious leader, was still widely believed to be hiding in the marshes of southern Somalia or possibly dead.  On Monday, an American Embassy official denied that the United States played any role in bringing him to Kenya. ''We're not holding or interrogating or protecting him,'' she said on condition of anonymity. ''We're not involved in this operation in any way.''  Kenyan officials did not return calls for comment.  European diplomats in Kenya said American officials were playing an increasingly large behind-the-scenes role in Somalia, pursuing an aggressive counterterrorism agenda but also trying to shape Somalia's political future.  Several Somali leaders seemed to welcome that involvement, saying that Italy, the other Western power in Somalia, had discredited itself by trying to establish a rapport with the Islamists before they were defeated.  Last month, the Islamists attacked Somalia's transitional government, which was based in Baidoa. What they did not expect was a crushing response from Somalia's neighbor Ethiopia, which sided with the transitional government because Ethiopian officials viewed the Islamists as a regional threat.  It took all of one week for the Ethiopian-led forces, with approval from American officials, to rout the Islamist army and install the transitional government in Mogadishu, Somalia's bullet-pocked capital by the sea.  Mogadishu is now loosely controlled by a mix of Ethiopian troops and government soldiers, who are struggling to pacify a population that is armed to the teeth. On Monday, residents said a gun battle between Ethiopian troops and masked men in a crowded livestock market killed seven people, four of them insurgents and three civilians.  Western diplomats said Mr. Ahmed, 42, could be enormously helpful in defusing the violence because he has a devoted following among former Islamist fighters, who are suspected of being the backbone of Somalia's growing insurgency.  United Nations officials said Mr. Ahmed could be granted political asylum in Kenya or another country in the region, possibly Yemen, so that he can meet with Somalia's new leaders on neutral soil and map out a path forward.  Abdirizak Adam Hassan, chief of staff for the transitional president, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, said that if the Islamic leader renounced violence, he would be welcome back in Somalia. ''We're not after his blood,'' he said.  The case is a little different, though, for Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys, the Islamists' top leader. Mr. Aweys is nowhere to be found, and most Somalis believe that he will never turn himself in because American and Ethiopian officials have accused him of being a terrorist.",

            "fulltext": "The Turkish police on Saturday arrested a 17-year-old suspect in the killing of a newspaper editor who championed Armenian rights, Turkish authorities said.  The editor, Hrant Dink, 52, a Turk of Armenian descent, was shot Friday afternoon outside the office of his newspaper, Agos. A gunman was recorded by a surveillance camera nearby, and the police appealed to the public for help in identifying him.  On Saturday night, Ogun Samast was captured in Samsun, a Black Sea port, after his father recognized his images from the surveillance video and notified the police in Trabzon, their hometown, said Muammer Guler, Istanbul's governor, at a news conference just before midnight.  ''The suspect was captured in Samsun on a passenger bus destined to Trabzon, together with all the evidence, including his gun and the white beret'' seen in the video, Mr. Guler said.  Mr. Samast, an unemployed secondary school graduate who arrived in Istanbul a week ago, admitted killing Mr. Dink, the Samsun police said.  The police are also looking into possible links between Mr. Samast and the killing of a Catholic priest, Andrea Santaro, last February. The assailant was a 16-year-old who, like the priest and Mr. Samast, was from Trabzon.  Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan praised the efforts of the security forces Saturday and expressed satisfaction that an arrest had been made before Mr. Dink's funeral on Tuesday. ''We're going to continue investigations with the same determination,'' Mr. Erdogan told the reporters, assuring that the arrest was only the start.  Mr. Guler said at a news conference earlier Saturday that Mr. Samast had visited the Agos office on Friday. He apparently posed as a university student hoping to meet Mr. Dink, whose secretary told the young man he would need an appointment.  The secretary later saw him loitering outside the office before Mr. Dink was attacked, Mr. Guler said.  Kazim Kolcuoglu, head of the Istanbul Bar Association, noting that Mr. Samast and the killer of Mr. Santaro were under 18, said that minors in Turkey are used in slayings because they face lower penalties than an adult convicted of the same crime.  As a 17-year-old, Mr. Samast will be interrogated by a public prosecutor instead of the police, and will be tried at a minors' court, which will lead to certain reductions on his possible jail term, Mr. Kolcuoglu said.  Mr. Dink's murder has shocked Turkey. Mr. Erdogan condemned the shooting as a direct attack on Turkey's stability, and analysts from diverse political backgrounds appeared to agree.  ''If the trigger finger aimed at the air of stability and confidence in Turkey, it hit the bull's eye,'' wrote Mehmet Barlas, a columnist for the center-right newspaper Sabah.  Although analysts like Mr. Barlas saw the assassination as a politically motivated attack on Turkey's progress toward membership in the European Union, others blamed a controversial law under which Mr. Dink had been convicted of insulting the Turkish identity.  Mr. Dink, who angered many in Turkey by challenging the official Turkish version of the 1915 Armenian genocide, was given a six-month, suspended sentence. But in the eyes of many radical nationalists, it made him a target.  Meanwhile, people continued to flock to the Agos office in Istanbul. Chants of ''We are all Armenians, we are all Hrants,'' filled the air.  ''We're here because we lost one of us,'' said a 33-year-old woman. As a teacher, she declined to give her name because it is illegal in Turkey for public workers to make public comments. ''I want to see the perpetrators be brought to justice and the plot behind this assassination clarified immediately,'' she said.  Agos, the only bilingual Armenian-Turkish newspaper in Turkey, was founded and run by Mr. Dink since 1996.  ''We lost the voice that spoke for us, but Turkey lost as much as we did,'' said Nadya Ismezoglu, an Armenian woman standing outside the Agos office. ''Our pain is indescribable.''",

            "fulltext": "The State Department's top diplomat for Africa plans to visit Mogadishu, the violence-scarred Somali capital, on Sunday, American officials said Friday. It would be the first time in more than a decade that a high-ranking United States official has set foot there.  But Al Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahri, urged the world's Muslims on Friday to turn Somalia into a battlefield and use suicide attacks.  These developments were part of Somalia's transformation after Ethiopian-led forces ousted the once powerful Islamist movement from the capital last week and helped install a potentially viable government there for the first time in over 16 years.  American officials said the schedule for the diplomat, Jendayi E. Frazer, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was still tentative, but that she planned to be in Mogadishu for four hours to meet with officials of the transitional government and leading Somali intellectuals.  The United States has had a minimal presence in the country since its diplomats were withdrawn in the fall of 1994, nearly a year after 18 Americans were killed during an ill-fated attempt to capture a warlord in Mogadishu. In his speech on Friday, Mr. Zawahri urged Muslim fighters to wage a holy guerrilla war in Somalia. ''I speak to you today as the crusader Ethiopian invasion forces violate the soil of the beloved Muslim Somalia,'' he said in an audio recording on a Web site that has featured Qaeda messages before. ''Launch ambushes, land mines, raids and suicidal attacks until you consume them as the lions eat their prey.''  It was not the first time that Muslim extremists have called for a holy war in Somalia.  Ethiopia has a long Christian history, and Somalia's Islamist leaders had been trying for months to rally outside support by portraying the Ethiopians as infidel invaders and urging Muslims worldwide to turn Somalia into the third front for jihad, after Iraq and Afghanistan.  In the end, though, Western intelligence officials said that only a few hundred foreign fighters heeded the call, and that they seemed to make little difference. The Islamist forces, made up of mostly untrained teenage troops, were routed by Ethiopian soldiers in one battle after another and lost in one week all the territory they had gained in the past six months.  Somalia's transitional government is now in loose control of most of the country and Western diplomats, including Ms. Frazer, are urging African nations to quickly put together a peacekeeping force before Somalia reverts to anarchy.  Officials from Ethiopia, one of the poorest nations in the world, have said that they do not have the resources to keep soldiers here much longer. Ethiopia has justified its intervention by saying that Somalia's Islamists were a regional menace.  Ms. Frazer met Friday with Kenyan and Somali officials in Nairobi to discuss the details of the peacekeeping force. Uganda has already volunteered troops, and Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania have indicated they might also send forces.  Ms. Frazer was to travel to Yemen and Djibouti on Saturday to pursue the matter.  In Mogadishu, the transitional government was struggling to collect weapons. Earlier in the week, Ali Muhammad Gedi, the transitional prime minister, announced that Thursday was the deadline for all militias and gunmen to surrender their arms. Only a handful have complied and the deadline has been pushed back to Saturday.  As for the Islamists, Somali officials said Friday that the last remnants of their forces were cornered in a remote area of southern Somalia, south of Kismayo. Somali officials said they expected the conflict to end soon, though the Islamists have vowed to fight on as an underground insurgency.",

            "fulltext": "The Islamist forces in Somalia abandoned their final stronghold Monday morning, fleeing the port city of Kismayo much like they had fled Mogadishu, the capital, last week.  In the face of an intense artillery barrage by Ethiopian-backed forces and thousands of well-equipped troops heading their way, the Islamists scattered, with some of their militia shedding their uniforms and melting back into the population while others headed south towards a thickly forested area along the Kenya border.  ''I can't tell you how happy people were that they disappeared,'' Adam Ragay, a businessman in Kismayo, said today.  As soon as the Islamists left, looters rushed into the streets and smashed up stores and ran away with TVs and mobile phones. But by mid-afternoon, the brief burst of anarchy was over and transitional government troops had arrived on the outskirts of town.  ''I can confirm to you that our forces have captured Kismayo,'' Somalia's transitional prime minister, Ali Mohamed Gedi, told The Associated Press today.  This leaves the transitional government of Somalia now in control of every major town in south-central Somalia, though there are fears the war may not be over and that the Islamists are simply switching to underground guerilla tactics. It took the transitional government, with the help of the Ethiopian military, one of the most powerful in Africa, all of one week to rout the Islamists.  Residents of Kismayo said the remaining Islamists were heading toward Ras Kamboni, a small town on the Kenyan border which western intelligence officers say has been used as a terrorist hide-out before.  Kenya officials have said that they have increased security on the border to keep the Islamists from escaping through Kenya.  As fighting began to flare up on Sunday around Kismayo, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.  Muhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said that 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.  ''We told them that they were going to lose,'' Mr. Arab said, ''and that our city would get destroyed.''  Kismayo, a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the fabled East African spice empire, has been spared the fighting so far.  But the Islamists, Mr. Arab said, did not care.  ''These guys are bent on war,'' he said.  The fighting started at around 5 p.m., with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib, a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo. As the shells began to rain down, residents said that clan militias within Kismayo turned on the Islamists.  That set off running gun battles across the city, with several people reportedly killed. It also accelerated the exodus out of Kismayo, with thousands of residents hastily tossing a few things over their shoulder and joining the stream of people fleeing the fighting in southern Somalia.  Local support for the Islamists in Kismayo is obviously evaporating, just as it did last week in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, when clan elders decided that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.  That led to the city falling much faster than anyone expected into the hands of Somalia's transitional government, which has used Ethiopian troops and airpower to reclaim much of the country. Clan elders are the pillars of Somali society, and many of the Islamist fighters in Mogadishu were clan militiamen loaned to the movement.  But the fighters in Kismayo were thought to be different. Kismayo is where the Islamist leadership fled after losing Mogadishu, bringing with them their most devout and hard-core fighters. Ethiopian officials have said that the Somali Islamists are bolstered by several thousand foreign fighters -- from Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Libya and Eritrea, Ethiopia's bitter enemy, though American intelligence officials say the numbers are far fewer, most likely in the hundreds.  Diplomats in the region were still searching for a way to avert disaster on Sunday. On Sunday, Kenyan officials, with American encouragement, continued to meet in Nairobi with the few remaining moderate leaders of the Islamist movement in an effort to reach a cease-fire. But the talks were slow-going, said one official close to the parties.  In Mogadishu, Mr. Gedi, the transitional prime minister, seems to relish his newfound authority. Mr. Gedi, a bookish veterinarian whom few Somalis would have recognized before last week's stunning comeback by the transitional government, is holding daily news conferences, meeting with clan elders and surveying bombed-out buildings for future office space. On Sunday, he reassured the populace in confident tones that the era of warlord rule was over.  ''People of Mogadishu do not have to fear,'' he said.  But many still do. A large explosion rocked an apartment building in Mogadishu on Saturday night, killing a woman. Some residents said it was a missile fired at nearby Ethiopian troops and possibly the opening salvo of an anti-Ethiopian insurgency. Later in the day, Ethiopian troops began to recede from Mogadishu's streets to barracks on the outskirts of the city.",

            "fulltext": "A hand grenade was tossed into a government army compound on Thursday night in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, in yet another sign of growing chaos in the country.  Just days after Ethiopian-led troops helped rout once powerful Islamist forces in Somalia and install a new government in the capital, security seemed to be unraveling across the country.  The violence is surging on two fronts: antigovernment attacks and increased banditry, both of which were virtually unheard of during the Islamists' short-lived reign.  Witnesses said that shortly after nightfall, a man in a pickup truck flung a grenade over a wall and into a compound that housed Ethiopian and government soldiers. Apparently, no one was seriously hurt and the pickup truck escaped in a blaze of gunfire.  In northern Mogadishu, residents said that four people were killed Wednesday night after bandits fired a bazooka at a truck whose driver refused to pay an extortion tax. Unauthorized checkpoints have popped up all over the city, reminiscent of the years of anarchy when clan-based militias carved up Mogadishu -- and much of the rest of Somalia, for that matter.  In Dhagtur, in central Somalia, Shabelle radio reported Thursday that five people, including two children, were killed by a tribal militia during a gun battle. A dispute over a well was cited as the possible cause.  But despite the worsening violence, Somalia's transitional government is moving to consolidate its tenuous grip on power. On Thursday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, the veterinarian who is now prime minister, appointed more than 30 new judges, including two women.  ''Quite soon, the police stations in Mogadishu will be operational,'' Mr. Gedi said. ''If a criminal is arrested, the police will have the access to put the criminal on trial.''  Since Somalia's central government collapsed in 1991, the wheels of justice have rusted over, leaving few functioning police stations, jails or courts.  Mr. Gedi also pushed ahead with his disarmament plan, extending until Saturday a deadline for turning in guns and threatening house-to-house searches if the guns were not surrendered.  In Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, announced Thursday that Uganda was ready to volunteer a battalion of around 800 soldiers to serve as peacekeepers in Somalia. The African Union is trying to cobble together a peacekeeping force to take the place of Ethiopian troops and lend much-needed muscle to the transitional government.  The transitional government is still battling the last remnants of the Islamist forces, who have fled to a remote, heavily forested area in southern Somalia along the Kenyan border. Somali officials said that several hundred Islamist fighters were cornered, and that it was only a matter of days until the Islamist movement, which had ruled much of Somalia for the past six months until Ethiopian forces intervened, was finished for good.",

            "fulltext": "The killing of an Armenian-Turkish editor in Istanbul last week and the sorrow it has generated within Turkey are leading to rare conciliatory gestures between Turkey and Armenia, historic enemies, and to calls for changes in laws here defending Turkish identity.  On Monday, Armenian political and spiritual figures accepted an invitation from the Turkish government to attend the funeral of Hrant Dink, the founder of an Armenian-Turkish newspaper, who was killed outside his office on Friday, apparently by a young nationalist fanatic.  The suspect in the slaying, Ogun Samast, 17, was escorted back to the scene of the crime Sunday night by law enforcement authorities.  The head of the Istanbul security forces said that Mr. Samast ''was driven to commit the crime by his nationalistic feelings'' and had no ties to any group.  Mr. Dink was a staunch defender of free speech and like other intellectuals was prosecuted for insulting ''Turkishness'' and sentenced to six months in jail, though his term was suspended.  Bulent Arinc, the parliamentary chairman from the ruling Justice and Development Party, said he would back efforts to abolish the measure under which Mr. Dink was prosecuted, known as Article 301.  ''It can be discussed to totally abolish or completely revise the Article 301,'' Mr. Arinc said, adding that members of Parliament ''are open to this.''  Despite the fact that the Armenian-Turkish border has been sealed since 1993 and diplomatic relations severed, Armenia is sending a deputy foreign minister, Arman Kirakossian, to the funeral, and the archbishop of the Armenian Church of America, Khajag Barsamian, also accepted the government's invitation to the ceremony.  Earlier, the Armenian defense minister, Serzh Sarkisyan, called for improved relations so that Armenia could ''establish ties with Turkey with no preconditions,'' the Turkish news channel NTV reported.  High-level Turkish government officials are expected to attend the funeral.  Turkey and Armenia have long been at odds over Turkey's refusal to use the term ''genocide'' to describe the deaths of Armenians beginning in 1915. Many scholars and most Western governments say more than a million Armenians were killed in a campaign they describe as genocide. Turkey calls the loss of life a consequence of a war in which both sides suffered casualties, and has suggested that a group of envoys from each country analyze the history. Armenia has expressed a willingness to participate but insists that the border must first be reopened to trade.  But many Armenians living abroad hold a much harder line and are lobbying the United States and European governments to deny Turkey entrance into the European Union until Ankara recognizes the killings as genocide.  Norman Stone, professor of history at Koc University in Istanbul, said Mr. Dink was killed at a time when Turkey was reacting to pressure to respond to the Armenian issue.  ''There are a lot of balanced people here who say, 'Look, the genocide issue is unclear, but if you just leave it as a matter of massacres, then we can start making progress,' '' Mr. Stone said.  The funeral is shaping up to be far more than a farewell to a popular though controversial figure. The fact that the government is permitting it to take place on a grand scale is another sign of a change.  A wide boulevard in the heart of Istanbul's main commercial district will be closed to traffic as the funeral cortege gathers outside the offices of the newspaper where Mr. Dink was shot.  The mayor of the district, Mustafa Sarigul, said the local government will hand out carnations and release hundreds of pigeons as a symbol of peace. Mr. Dink once said, ''I may see myself as frightened as a pigeon, but I know that in this country people do not touch pigeons.''  The procession is expected to advance for about a mile before the body is driven across the Golden Horn to the Kumkapi district for a Christian funeral Mass at the Church of the Virgin Mary. Among the Turkish government officials expected to attend the Mass are the interior minister, Abdulkadir Aksu, and the deputy prime minister, Mehmet Ali Sahin. Burial is to follow at the Balikli Armenian Cemetery.  Most Armenian Turks live in Istanbul, the diverse and cosmopolitan center of Turkey. But the antinationalist demonstrations that followed Mr. Dink's killing also surfaced in places as diverse as Izmir, the Aegean coastal city that is Turkey's third largest, and in Sanliurfa and Hatay, which are close to Turkey's eastern border with Syria.  ''Public opinion in both countries, weary of the years-long conflict, had reached a point of explosion,'' said Kaan Soyak, a director of the Turkish-Armenian Business Development Commission, the only bilateral trade council of Turkish and Armenian executives. ''That's what lies behind the massive outpouring for Mr. Dink.''  Ethnic Armenian Turks, like Jewish and Greek Turks, are an officially recognized minority group and as such are allowed to operate their own schools. Mr. Dink, for example, attended Armenian schools in Istanbul until entering a state-run university.  Mr. Dink was labeled as a target among nationalist groups on their Web sites. Mr. Samast, the suspect, read and was influenced by those postings, according to the Anatolian news agency.  Seven other suspects were also being detained over the weekend, including Yasin Hayal, who served 11 months in jail for the bombing of a McDonald's restaurant in Trabzon in 2004.  Mr. Hayal, a known nationalist, is suspected of having a history of Islamic militant activity. He attempted to join the rebels in Chechnya but was turned away at the border, his former lawyer, Fatih Cakir, said by telephone on Sunday.  Havva Samast, Mr. Samast's mother, knew that her son and Mr. Hayal were friends.  ''I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw him on television and had a shock,'' she said during a televised interview with the Dogan News Agency from her and her son's home city of Trabzon. ''He couldn't have done this on his own. I know that he was friends with'' Mr. Hayal.  But many here still blame Article 301 for Mr. Dink's death and see it as an obstacle to freedom of speech in Turkey.",

            "fulltext": "Hundreds of Somalis stormed Saturday into the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia's already unsteady capital, to hurl rocks at Ethiopian troops allied with the government and to protest a disarmament program that Somali leaders ended up scrapping.  Meanwhile, near Kismayo, along Somalia's southern coast, Ethiopian-led forces continued to hunt down the last remnants of the once powerful Islamist forces, who ruled much of the country until Ethiopia and its powerful army intervened last month.  According to Abdul Rashid Hidig, a government official in Kismayo, the Ethiopian-led forces blew up several of the Islamists' armed pickup trucks, leaving hundreds of fighters cornered in a remote jungle with their backs to the Indian Ocean and no way to escape. ''I think it will be over very soon,'' Mr. Hidig said.  Still, a pack of gunmen attacked a government patrol near Kismayo's market on Saturday night, and the cracks and whistles of their high-powered rifles echoed across what had been a rather quiet town. It was unclear if anyone was hurt.  Despite much tactical success in recent weeks, Somalia's transitional government appears to have failed its first leadership test: disarmament. After 16 years of anarchy, the streets of Mogadishu are awash with military-grade weaponry, much of it in the hands of illiterate teenagers. Scooping up these guns was one of the first goals of the transitional government, which had struggled for the past two years to assert control and then, nearly overnight, found itself in charge of a needy, violent country.  On Monday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, a veterinarian turned transitional prime minister, demanded that all Somalis surrender their weapons in three days. Only a handful of Mr. Gedi's allies complied, so the prime minister extended the deadline, but still, most Somalis did not give up their guns.  Even former military officers disagreed with Mr. Gedi's approach, saying it would take months, not days, to disarm the populace and that the government should negotiate with militiamen and clan elders.  With the new deadline set to expire Saturday morning and with Mr. Gedi threatening house-to-house searches, riots exploded.  No matter that officials in the government had decided at the last minute to abandon the disarmament program, at least temporarily. By the time the government got the word out Saturday, hundreds of people had already flooded into Mogadishu's streets. Residents quickly erected roadblocks out of chunks of concrete and flaming tires, and some witnesses said men with rocket-propelled grenades lurked in doorways, prepared to attack government troops.  According to several protesters, the demonstrations were organized by the defeated Islamist movement, which still has thousands of supporters, many armed, in the capital. The supporters had melted back into the population late last month after the Islamists abandoned Mogadishu, ceding it to Ethiopian and Somali forces without a fight.  On Saturday, women in a kaleidoscope of colored shawls shook Korans in their hands and shouted ''Down, down, Ethiopia!'' and ''The infidels must die!'' Ethiopia is a country with a long Christian history, though it is about half Muslim. Somalia's Islamist leaders have repeatedly tried to stir up support by casting the Ethiopian troops as infidel invaders.  The demonstrators surged through downtown Mogadishu lighting fires with plastic jugs of gasoline, throwing rocks at cars and punching fists through windows.  ''Unless we do this, the Ethiopians will never leave,'' said Nuro Ibraheim, a 28-year-old woman. The protesters surrounded a military camp used by Ethiopian and government troops and began to pelt it with stones. According to witnesses, Ethiopian troops first fired in the air. When that did not work, the witnesses said, the soldiers aimed into the crowd and several people were hurt. Hospital officials said one teenage boy was killed.  By midday, the violence had flared out, and the demonstrators had gone home.  ''We have postponed the disarmament until an unspecified time,'' said Salad Ali Jelle, the deputy defense minister. ''We are now talking with clan elders about how to proceed.''  The transitional government, a mix of clan elders, foreign-educated professionals and former warlords, was formed in 2004 with the help of United Nations officials and has a mandate to rule until proposed elections in 2009. The transitional government concedes that it needs outside muscle to maintain order once the Ethiopians go home.  Americans officials have been heavily lobbying African allies, especially Uganda, Nigeria and South Africa, to contribute troops to a peacekeeping force. On Sunday, Jendayi E. Frazer, the United States assistant secretary of state for Africa, is scheduled to visit Mogadishu for four hours to meet with Somali leaders and intellectuals.  The trip is still tentative because of the continuing turmoil. If Ms. Frazer does arrive, she will be the highest ranking American official to set foot in Somalia since American forces pulled out of the country in 1994, the year after 18 Americans were killed during an attempt to capture a warlord in Mogadishu.",

            "fulltext": "Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul called Wednesday for changes in a controversial law that penalizes insults against Turkish identity.  Hrant Dink, the Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor who was assassinated last week, had been convicted under the law late last year. Many Turks say the conviction labeled Mr. Dink a traitor in the eyes of ultranationalist groups and made him a target.  ''We see that in its present version, it causes some problems,'' the foreign minister said of the law, adding that his government supported free speech as long as it did not incite violence.  Mr. Gul's comments suggest that change is not far away; the government consulted civic organizations last year about revisions to the language of the law.  In the wake of Mr. Dink's slaying, calls to revise the law, Article 301 of the penal code, began with the chairman of Parliament, Bulent Arinc, when he said Saturday that he was in favor of a move against the law.  The law, which carries a jail term of six months, has been applied mostly against intellectuals, like the Nobel laureate in literature Orhan Pamuk, who have commented about the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Army in the 1910s. Virtually anyone tried under the law, convicted or not, has drawn public threats and hate mail from ultranationalists.  In his last article in the Agos newspaper, which he founded, Mr. Dink expressed his fear of the threats but, according to security officials, did not request protection. Mr. Pamuk, the novelist Elif Safak, who was also tried under Article 301, and others were provided security this week, news reports said.  More than 50,000 people poured into Istanbul streets on Tuesday to protest the killing, in the largest public commemoration in the city since the death of President Turgut Ozal in 1993. Many political analysts and friends of Mr. Dink considered the huge outpouring to be an opportunity to introduce political efforts to improve relations between Armenia and Turkey.  Such efforts were given a head start this week when the Foreign Ministry extended invitations to the spiritual leaders of Armenians around the world and to the Armenian deputy foreign minister, Arman Kirakossian, whose attendance at the funeral was the first time that a ranking Armenian official had come to Turkey since the two countries froze diplomatic relations in 1993 and closed their border.  Mr. Kirakossian, impressed by the size and the diversity of the crowd that attended three days of public protests and the funeral, said Armenia was unconditionally ready to revive diplomatic relations, the semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported.  His statement was partly echoed in Mr. Gul's carefully worded statement in Ankara. ''Today, we improve our relations with all our neighbors on the basis of mutual trust and respect,'' Mr. Gul said. ''Of course we wish to improve relations also with Armenia.''  Diplomatic ties were severed during a dispute over Nagorno Karabakh, a region that Armenia claims but that Turkey recognizes as part of Azerbaijan. But the true heart of the dispute is over the Armenian genocide, in which more than one million Armenians died from 1915 to 1918.  Turkey's stance on Nagorno Karabakh has been that a governmental history commission should be formed to analyze the issues. Armenia has expressed a willingness to take part in a discussion but has insisted that the border be reopened to trade first.  Ogun Samast, the 17-year-old suspect in Mr. Dink's death, was formally arrested Wednesday. His lawyer, Levent Yildirim, assigned by the Istanbul Bar Association, told reporters that his client regretted killing Mr. Dink.  Yasin Hayal, an ultranationalist who had spent 11 months in jail for the bombing of a McDonald's restaurant in Trabzon in 2004, was also formally arrested Wednesday with three other suspects who had been detained and investigated for suspected links with the killing, NTV reported.  As he was escorted into the prosecutor's office in Istanbul, Mr. Hayal hurled threats about Mr. Pamuk.  ''Orhan Pamuk should be careful!'' he yelled at cameras.  Correction:  January 31, 2007, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the future of relations between Turkey and Armenia following the funeral for Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor killed in Istanbul on Jan. 19, misidentified the issue between the two countries that Turkey has said should be examined by a governmental history commission.

''I think the manner was quite deplorable, really,'' said the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. ''I don't think one can endorse in any way that, whatever your views about capital punishment.''  Responding to the murky scenes that emerged after the execution showing witnesses and guards chanting and telling Saddam to ''go to hell'' as his executioners prepared to hang him, Mr. Prescott added: ''Frankly, to get that kind of recorded messages coming out is totally unacceptable, and I think whoever is involved and responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves.''

Images of Mr. Hussein with a noose around his neck have been plastered across newspapers and shown on television all weekend here. In a country implacably opposed to the death penalty, the sight has been shocking, as was the speed with which it was carried out.  Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in Florida, has not spoken publicly about Mr. Hussein's death, an omission that has been seized on by antiwar members of his Labor Party as another misstep in a long succession of them on Iraq.

''We have made our position very clear to the Iraqi authorities, but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation,'' she said. Asked if the government had also complained to the Iraqis about how the execution was carried out, Mr. Prescott repeated what Ms. Beckett had said.  THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ",

The urgency of this task is attributable in no small measure to indifference by Mr. Spitzer's predecessor, George Pataki. Although he periodically gave lip service to making improvements in the courts, occasionally following through, Mr. Pataki generally shied from expending the necessary energy or political capital to persuade the State Legislature to go along. To the extent Mr. Pataki led in this sphere, it was mostly by bad example. His misuse of the governor's judicial appointment power to play politics -- even to the extent of packing Manhattan's appellate court with upstate Republicans -- has left a legacy of mediocrity and cronyism.  Mr. Spitzer has already announced his support for two fundamental reforms: a major court restructuring to simplify the state's wacky organizational chart of nine separate trial courts, and a switch from clubhouse-dominated elections for the State Supreme Court, the state's highest trial court, to a new system of merit appointments. Here is a brief look at these and two other court reform matters needing priority attention:  Court Restructuring. Mr. Spitzer has embraced Chief Judge Judith Kaye's sensible proposal to merge the court system's archaic maze of trial courts into a modern, two-tiered system that permits efficient deployment of resources and personnel. Its enactment will require a sustained effort. As in the past, attempts may be made to preserve patronage by exempting Surrogate's Court from the reorganization. Moreover, the overhaul will require amending the state Constitution, meaning approval must be given by two separate Legislatures -- the present one and the one to be chosen in November 2008 -- before the measure goes to voters.  Merit Selection. The system of sham elections that allowed party leaders to award State Supreme Court seats to their handpicked favorites at tightly controlled nominating conventions was declared unconstitutional last year. Unless the Legislature devises a new system, the discredited conventions will be replaced by primaries that could open judicial campaigns and decision-making to special interest contributions without breaking the courthouse-clubhouse link at the heart of recent judicial scandals.  A special commission appointed by Judge Kaye suggested tweaking the convention system in ways that would make it feasible for political outsiders to compete at the conventions and gain a berth on the ballot, mandate review of candidates' credentials by independent screening panels, and forbid sitting judges from hearing cases involving people who donated above a certain amount to their campaigns. But the wise, permanent fix is the one Mr. Spitzer advocates: Amending the state Constitution to provide a new merit selection system.  Judicial Pay. The last time New York's judges got a salary increase was eight years ago. As a matter of fairness, and to avoid harming the recruitment and retention of quality judges, Mr. Spitzer needs to press the Legislature to approve catch-up raises. He should also get behind Judge Kaye's proposal for changing the manner of setting judicial compensation. The present system holds judicial salaries hostage to the legislators' own pay raises.  Town and Village Courts. Responding to press accounts of abusive practices by ''justice courts'' doing business in rural areas around the state, Albany and Judge Kaye have been exploring remedies. Any new package should mandate more training for these justices, require that all be lawyers, and enhance indigent defense services. Mr. Spitzer's persuasive powers will be greatly needed here, since these changes will affect upstate communities represented by Republican members of the Senate.",

            "fulltext": "Setting up a potential showdown with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a panel charged with picking the next state comptroller went against Mr. Silver's wishes in naming three finalists on Thursday, none of them members of the State Legislature.  Mr. Silver effectively controls the selection of the comptroller if the Assembly Democrats he leads stay unified. He said earlier in the week that he wanted a fellow Assembly member to get the job -- and would not necessarily be bound by the panel's choices.  Two of the three finalists, Howard S. Weitzman and Martha E. Stark, are top finance officials in government. Mr. Weitzman is the comptroller of Nassau County, and Ms. Stark is the commissioner of the New York City Department of Finance.  The third finalist is William J. Mulrow, an investment banker who ran for comptroller in 2002 and who is close to Gov. Eliot Spitzer.  The panel resulted from an agreement between Mr. Silver and Governor Spitzer, who had originally sought a fiscal expert for comptroller but later softened that stance, saying he would be open to a lawmaker. But the panel's choices -- and Mr. Silver's desire that a lawmaker get the job -- could put the governor in a delicate position.The panelists, the former state comptrollers H. Carl McCall and Edward V. Regan and the former New York City comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, made their decision after meeting in New York City on Thursday. Their decision followed hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday in Albany where all the candidates were interviewed before a committee of state senators and Assembly members.  In a joint statement, the three former comptrollers said they ''were impressed with the thoughtfulness of all the candidates'' but that after ''careful consideration of all the candidates and a review of their backgrounds, experience and credentials, we have concluded that Messrs. Mulrow and Weitzman and Ms. Stark are all qualified to be state comptroller.''  In an interview Mr. Regan said: ''There were only three that had the qualifications that had been set out. It could have been two, it could have been four. The governor's instructions were pretty clear, and that's why I signed on. He said up to five, high-quality, nonpartisan. We interpreted that as management experience and financial literacy.''  Asked why none of the Assembly members who had applied made the cut, Mr. Regan said that each had brought significant credentials to the table but that none had enough managerial experience. ''They'd never managed anything big,'' Mr. Regan said. ''We looked for people that could walk into the comptroller's office and start running it on the first day.''  At least some of the candidates did not agree. ''I heard more than three qualified people over the last several days, both members and nonmembers,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who was among the five Assembly members bidding for the post.  In a statement issued on Thursday, Mr. Silver said: ''The agreement between the parties involved in developing this process was that five candidates would be recommended to the Legislature for their consideration. Unfortunately, the panel's decision did not conform to this agreement and the charge given to them. We will review this matter to determine how we will proceed with Governor Spitzer, Senator Bruno, and the members of the Legislature shortly.''  A spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer said the governor intended to review the finalists, but would not comment further.  Under state law, Mr. Hevesi's replacement must be chosen through a majority vote of the combined Assembly and Senate. But under the deal he struck with Mr. Spitzer and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the panel was charged with recommending up to five finalists, according to a press release put out by the governor at the time. A spokesman for Mr. Silver said that it had been the speaker's understanding that the panel would select no fewer than five candidates.  The Legislature was to choose from among the finalists. The decision to select only three finalists, none of them an Assembly member, seems likely to provoke Mr. Silver.  Mr. Regan said that he had spoken with Mr. Silver before announcing the candidates, and that the speaker had raised the issue of the panel recommending only three finalists instead of five. ''The word 'five' became a metaphor for, he had promised his conference that there would be an assemblyman there,'' Mr. Regan said. ''That's not the problem. The problem was, who had the goods for the comptroller's office?''  But there may be other problems, too. In the interview published yesterday, Mr. Silver, asked what he would do if the panel picked only one finalist, responded: ''They can give me whatever they want. We don't have to listen to them, either.''  A spokesman for Mr. Bruno declined to say whether the majority leader would back such a course.  ''The joint committees, along with the three former comptrollers, did an exhaustive review,'' said the spokesman, John E. McArdle. ''We appreciate the work that they did, and now it's up to the Legislature to review their recommendations and determine the appropriate course that we should take.''  At least one person, however, was thrilled by yesterday's news.  ''I feel terrific,'' said Mr. Weitzman, one of the three picked. ''I feel great, and I feel honored to be selected by three such experienced people.''",

The Republican candidate, Maureen O'Connell, recently wrote a letter to Governor Spitzer urging him to support a Nassau County Democrat, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, below, for state comptroller.  ''As the taxpayers' advocate, the state comptroller must possess independence and integrity,'' Ms. O'Connell wrote in the letter, which was also published in a local newspaper. ''Assemblyman DiNapoli personifies these traits and, through his lifetime of public service, he has earned the public's trust.''  Mr. DiNapoli is one of at least 18 people -- lawmakers, current or former officials and businessmen -- seeking to replace the former comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned after pleading guilty to a felony for using a state worker to chauffeur his wife.  Ms. O'Connell, who is running in a district where registered Democrats now outnumber registered Republicans, said in an interview that she had not yet run into any Republicans who were miffed that she would back a Democrat for the high-profile office.  Since Democrats will have the upper hand in choosing the next comptroller, few Republicans expressed any interest in the race -- with one exception being Andrew S. Eristoff, a commissioner of tax and finance in the Pataki administration.  ''The reason I wrote the letter is because I've known Tom DiNapoli for a long time,'' Ms. O'Connell, herself a former assemblywoman from the area, said in an interview.

The plan, which is still being negotiated, calls for creating an outside panel of experts -- former state or city comptrollers, for example -- and asking the panel to forward a short list of qualified candidates to the entire Legislature for a vote, said several Democrats who were granted anonymity to describe the private negotiations.  The choice of a comptroller to replace Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned in disgrace, has been a flashpoint between Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Assembly. The governor has said he would like an outsider with financial experience, while some lawmakers are vying for the post and others warn that the governor should not be allowed to choose the fiscal officer who will audit his agencies and monitor his budgets and contracts.  While aides to Mr. Spitzer have said they would like the new comptroller to have financial expertise and to come from ''outside government,'' Mr. Spitzer signaled on Monday that he would be open to considering a candidate from the Assembly.  ''I have never said that one of them couldn't be a good comptroller, or one of them might not end up being a good comptroller,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''What I have said is that we need to look for certain standards and qualifications, and begin with a question relating to qualifications, rather than membership, and then we go from there.''  While the State Constitution gives the Legislature the power the choose the next comptroller to fill the vacancy -- and the Assembly Democrats have the deciding vote, since they constitute a majority of the Legislature -- the Spitzer administration has been trying to recruit candidates and to influence the final decision.  Candidates will be invited to speak at a joint legislative hearing. Some details of the agreement must still be resolved, including who would serve on the panel, and how brief its list would be. Once the list is forwarded, though, it will still fall to the Assembly to choose a candidate from it -- and it is unclear how much deference Assembly Democrats intend to give to the new governor's wishes.",

Daines, the chief executive of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, to be the new state health commissioner, according to several executives in the hospital industry.  The appointment, which the executives said could be announced today, would designate the person to carry out a painful, politically charged downsizing plan that will close nine hospitals around the state and merge or shrink dozens of others.  The commissioner also heads a sprawling department that runs the Medicaid program, which consumes about 40 percent of the state budget.  The governor's office declined to comment, and calls to officials at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center were not returned.  But several industry officials, who were granted anonymity because they did not want to risk angering the governor by disclosing the appointment before the official announcement, said that they had talked with the governor's advisers and that Dr. Daines was the choice.  Dr. Daines would bring to the job an intimate knowledge of New York's health care economy and the way decisions in Albany reverberate for providers and patients.  By contrast, previous commissioners have had backgrounds primarily in public health policy or administration in other states. Hospital officials said that the Spitzer team had seriously considered several people with practical experience in the state's health care industry.  There was some carping among hospital officials at the selection of Dr. Daines, because he is associated with Continuum Health Partners, the parent company of St. Luke's-Roosevelt, which was viewed as having survived well in the statewide hospital downsizing plan -- the same plan the new commissioner will carry out.  Governor Spitzer has already rearranged the major policymaking positions on his health care team in ways that health care experts say could limit the power of the new commissioner.  Dennis P. Whalen, who will work in the governor's office as Mr. Spitzer's chief health care adviser, carries more knowledge and authority into that position than any recent predecessor. He is currently the longtime executive deputy commissioner of the Health Department. And Governor Spitzer has already created a new position of deputy health commissioner in charge of health insurance programs, and appointed Debra Bachrach to it.  Dr. Daines, who has a reputation as an able, low-key administrator, joined St. Luke's-Roosevelt in 2000 as medical director, and became president and chief executive in 2002. Before that, he worked for a dozen years at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, as medical director and later as senior vice president.

The new comptroller will play an enormous but largely unseen role in safeguarding the state's finances for the next four years. There will be great pressure to make a political choice, but legislators should resist that instinct and vote for the most able and independent candidate.  We are not ready to endorse a candidate, but it is not too early to lay out the job qualifications, starting with fearless independence. The new comptroller will not only have to audit Gov. Eliot Spitzer's administration, but may also look at any state spending -- including how the Legislature doles out its pork and other political favors. For this reason, the five or so Democratic Assembly members who want the position bear the heaviest burden of showing their independence. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who controls the largest bloc in the Legislature, will play the biggest role in choosing the next comptroller. It should not be someone who goes easy on Mr. Silver and his colleagues in return for getting the job.  Financial expertise is also a must. The new comptroller will single-handedly be responsible for investing $146 billion in state pension money. The state needs someone with a sure hand to protect the state's retirees, and someone who knows how to use the power of that fund to promote good corporate governance and socially responsible investments.  The next comptroller should have a proven record as a reformer. He or she will have to reject pleas to waste scarce positions on the politically connected, and be willing to shake things up, from wasteful public authorities to mismanaged school districts. The person should promise to work for public campaign financing for the comptroller's job.  Mr. Spitzer and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly have agreed on what sounds like a good process. There will be public hearings, and a group of former comptrollers will winnow the field down to five contenders. But in the end legislators will choose. Their responsibility is to choose someone who will look out for the interests of all New Yorkers, not simply those who did the choosing.  Editorial",

Eliot Spitzer and legislative leaders are expected to announce an agreement on Wednesday to combine two state commissions that look into lobbying and ethics, merging them in a bid to centralize investigations into corruption, people with knowledge of the discussions said.  One panel, the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, has been investigating whether an Albany-area business executive broke any state laws by providing free or discounted flights to the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno -- who is also the subject of a federal investigation. That commission is also believed to be examining flights that another executive provided to Eliot Spitzer while he was running for governor.  The other panel, the State Ethics Commission, played a leading role in the inquiry that led to the resignation of the former state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi.  Civic groups expressed concern about merging the two panels, but not a third that looks into legislative ethics, even though that body is widely viewed as the weakest of the three.  That panel, the Legislative Ethics Committee, would have some outside members who are not legislators added to its board and some of the tight restrictions on disclosure of its work eased under the changes being discussed. The agreement is also expected to extend to the Legislature bans on gifts that the governor announced for the executive branch.  There was some concern that talks about ethics and disclosure rules were being conducted in secret by the three men who govern the state.  Press officers for the three would say little about the talks. Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for the governor, declined to comment. John McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, the state's top Republican, said, ''We have been involved in discussions over the last several weeks on ethics and lobbying reform.'' Charles Carrier, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, declined to comment.  The State Ethics Commission looks into the conduct of executive branch employees, while the Legislative Ethics Committee investigates legislators and the lobbying commission investigates those who give things of value to state workers.  Much of the ultimate reaction to the proposal will depend on the fine print of the agreement and the role in the new entity given to the lobbying commission's executive director, David Grandeau, who is seen by many as the most active investigator of malfeasance by state officials but who has made no small number of enemies. He has at various points investigated registered lobbyists over their ties to all three of the state's current leaders.  ''If you get rid of the one person that is actually the cop on the beat now, that does concern us,'' said Rachel Leon, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government watchdog group. But she added that there were ''many good elements'' of the proposal, or at least what was being said about it.  Mr. Grandeau said he had not been told about the discussions. ''I am supportive of consolidation, it is something I discussed with the transition team, but it's not about the form, it's going to be about substance,'' he said.",

''We do everything we can to not interact with them,'' said Becky Scott, a biologist who has worked at the foundation for two years. To remain emotionally unattached, the staff identifies its charges according to the order in which they are rescued. The hooded seal, for instance, was the 3,597th marine mammal it had rescued or recovered in New York. The numbers after the dash represent the year it was taken in.  But there is a book on display in the aquarium with biographies of rescued animals like Squirt, a harbor seal, and Horton, a Kemp's ridley turtle. ''The animals are named when they are deemed releasable as part of our adoption program,'' Ms. Scott said.  As extensive as its programs are, the foundation is looking for improved facilities. The wish list includes an operating room (two area veterinarians currently volunteer their facilities for surgeries) and an enclosure for the 42,000-gallon outdoor dolphin tank.  Riverhead Foundation rescuers respond to an average of 30 whale and dolphin strandings each year, although seal and turtle rescues are most common. The foundation has the largest stranding center on the East Coast, said its president, Chuck Bowman.  This month staff biologists and trained volunteers led the largest dolphin rescue effort in the foundation's 10-year history. Working with rescuers from across the country, they steered 8 of an estimated 20 common dolphins trapped in shallow regions of Noyack Creek into the safety of deeper waters.  Last Sunday one of the 12 dolphins that did not survive was being prepared for necropsy in a small outbuilding. Dr. Cheryl Cross, a veterinary pathologist from the University of Tennessee, and Dr. Janet Whaley, the national stranding coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, planned to take samples of the organs to be tested for bacteria, viruses, contaminants and infectious diseases. A marine mammal biologist from the Smithsonian Institution was also on hand to analyze the dolphin's life.  ''We're really proud of Riverhead,'' Dr. Whaley said. ''It was a stressful week for them, but they are very professional.''  The foundation has come a long way, said its director and senior biologist, Robert DiGiovanni, who was a founding volunteer. Mr. DiGiovanni and others stepped in to care for the rescued animals when the Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation, a rescue group based at the aquarium, went bankrupt in 1996.  ''That was a time when we scraped together gas money to do what we needed to do,'' he said, noting that Mr. Bowman's personal truck once served as the emergency transport vehicle. Mr. Bowman recalled the oil stains and stench left behind by one stranded whale.  While conservation is their common goal, Mr. DiGiovanni said scientific discovery is what motivates the foundation's six paid staff members and dozens of volunteers. Noting their role in the recent dolphin rescues and the research of the stranding, he said, ''We're on the forefront.''  RESCUE WORK",

            "fulltext": "Thrift is often the best catalyst for culinary invention. Penny-pinching dishes like panzanella, poule au pot and beef rag\u00f9 were all responses of wily cooks to hard times. Likewise, the recipe for these pork chops with rye-bread stuffing, which The Times published in 1959, was billed as a dinner on the cheap. Pork chops are an inexpensive cut of meat, and bread stuffing was used, as it has been for hundreds of years, to stretch the portions.  Using rye bread, with its strong grain flavor, and seasoning it with saut\u00e9ed onion, garlic, parsley and caraway, give the stuffing distinction far beyond its means. From here the technique is pure 1950s: the chops are browned in the oven, and a sauce is made with the brown but succulent drippings. The result is very ... brown. But toothsome -- like a better-dressed cousin of pastrami on rye.  Nowadays supermarket pork chops have become so thin and industrially produced that they yield a dish with the texture of particle board. It's worth the effort to find a butcher who carries good, fat-marbled chops and who can cut them thickly -- an inch is best. (Also, I've reworked the recipe a bit, cooking the meat covered in the oven to keep it moist, then finishing it under the broiler.)  I gave the recipe to Marco Canora, the chef at Hearth in New York, to try, and he was surprised by how much he liked the pork chops. ''I'm not just saying this,'' he added. ''They were delicious.''  When Canora modernized the recipe, he turned to an even cheaper cut: pork belly. First he brined it, then braised it in a combination of thick, cloudy apple cider and stock infused with garlic, thyme and caraway. ''I've always liked cabbage with pork,'' he said, so he also braised a little red cabbage with apple, mustard seeds, cider vinegar and more caraway. The finished dish -- a square of meat and a tangle of wilted red cabbage shored up with braising juices (pink on red on brown) -- is an intoxicating blend of pork, caraway and cider vinegar. It's pastrami on rye's urbane, wholesome cousin.  On first read, Canora's recipe is cheflike and daunting. But while its steps stretch over three days -- brining, braising, finishing -- the total amount of work involved is little more than that for the pork chops. Still skeptical? The night Canora put the dish on his menu, it sold out in half an hour.  1959: Pork Chops With Rye-Bread Stuffing  This recipe appeared in The Times in an article by Craig Claiborne.  6 bone-in, 1-inch-thick loin chops  3 tablespoons butter  1 medium onion, finely chopped  1 large clove garlic, minced  3 1/2 cups soft rye-bread crumbs  (a mix of large and small pieces, without caraway seeds)  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds  3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley  Salt and pepper  1 large egg, lightly beaten with 3 tablespoons water  1 tablespoon flour  3/4 cup chicken broth.  1. Have a butcher cut a generous pocket in each chop or a slit to butterfly the chops for stuffing.  2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a saut\u00e9 pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a large bowl and add the bread crumbs, caraway seeds, parsley, teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Add the beaten egg and mix with a fork until blended.  3. Fill the chops with the stuffing, then seal the pockets with toothpicks. Season on all sides with salt and pepper. Arrange in a braising pan or other shallow baking dish fitted with a lid. Bake, covered, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, not the stuffing, reaches 155 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes.  4. Remove the lid and place the pan under the broiler just until the chops are browned and the temperature in the thickest part of the meat is 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm.  5. Set the braising pan on the stove over medium heat and reduce the pan juices to a thick glaze. Add the remaining tablespoon butter. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer, scraping up the pan drippings, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; strain. Season to taste. Serve the pork chops with the sauce. Serves 6.  Brined-and-Braised Pork Belly With Caraway  By Marco Canora, the chef and co-owner of Hearth  For the brine:  1 cup caraway seeds  3 tablespoons fennel seeds  3 tablespoons whole black peppercorns  3 tablespoons coriander seeds  1 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more as needed  1 cup packed dark brown sugar  6 cloves garlic, crushed  2 cups cider vinegar  2 pounds pork belly (center cut)  For the braise:  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons canola oil  1 carrot, chopped  1 stalk celery, chopped  1 onion, chopped  4 cloves garlic, crushed  6 sprigs thyme  3 tablespoons caraway seeds, toasted  4 cups apple cider  4 cups chicken broth.  1. Two days before serving the pork, prepare the brine: In a large skillet over low heat, toast the caraway seeds. Cool and grind in a spice grinder. In a large plastic container, combine the caraway, fennel, peppercorns, coriander, salt, brown sugar, garlic, cider vinegar and 4 cups water. Add the pork, cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.  2. The next day, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Remove the pork from the brine and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper. In a braising pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the pork and brown on all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add the carrot, celery, onion, garlic, thyme and 2 tablespoons toasted caraway seeds to the pan. Brown the vegetables until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return the pork to the pan, skin side up. Pour in the apple cider and enough broth to cover the meat by three-fourths. Bring to a boil, then cover and braise in the oven until the pork is very tender, about 2 hours. Cool the pork in its cooking liquid and refrigerate overnight.  3. The next day, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Scrape off and discard excess fat from the braising liquid. Remove the pork and discard loose gelatin. Cut the pork into serving pieces and place in a wide saut\u00e9 pan with a heatproof handle. Bring the braising liquid to a boil and reduce by about two-thirds, or until it lightly coats the back of a spoon; strain. Pour just enough liquid over the pork to submerge halfway. Sprinkle with the remaining caraway seeds, then place the pan in the oven and heat through, basting occasionally. Top pork with sauce and serve with braised cabbage, a recipe for which can be found at nytimes.com/magazine. Serves 4.",

            "fulltext": "WITH winter having unmistakably arrived, the sunny presence of lemons is more welcome than ever. Each year, demand for lemons peaks with the temperatures, as millions are squeezed for lemonade. But this is the time of year you need their brightness the most.  The harvest season's variety of diversions lets you feel free to juice lemons and dispose of the rest. But these cold days require more resourceful use of the fruit, especially with lemon prices rising and supplies reduced because of a recent freeze in California.  With plenty of sugar, and time to transform, whole lemon slices -- pulp, pith, peel and all -- become an intensely flavored tart. Candied, the peel gives another dimension to the pie's lemonade flavor. An almondy shortbread is an assertive pairing. (A little lemon juice added to the dough tenderizes it.)  Lemon zest -- the yellow part of the peel -- adds lemon flavor without the acidity of the pulp and juice. Sprinkle it on a meaty braise, on chunks of salty feta, or crisp fritters, sweet (ricotta) or savory (spinach). Candied strips also make a delightful afternoon nibble.  Pasta has an unlikely affinity for lemon, both zest and juice. Creamy, cheesy spaghetti al limone is succulent and lively. For a more streamlined dish -- no need for a recipe -- toss olive oil-splashed spaghetti with lemon juice and zest, then finish with Parmesan and a hit of the fermented anchovy sauce called garum, or some anchovies melted in hot oil. It's the umami flavor of a Caesar salad for a cold night.  Lemon is chicken's best friend -- stuffed whole inside a roasting bird with a sprig of rosemary, or wrapped in foil, baked soft and pur\u00e9ed for a sauce, \u00e0 la Jean-Georges Vongerichten, or tossed with fennel and egg yolk for a rich, tangy sauce.  Dozens of lemon varieties are grown around the world, varying in their sweetness, astringency and fragrance, the thickness of their skin, their juiciness. In the United States one variety, the Eureka, is probably the most widely grown.  But California's Meyer lemon, with its distinctive perfume and sweet, delicate flesh, has an almost cult-like following. A hybrid of lemon and sweet orange, it can be sliced, dressed with olive oil and sea salt and eaten on its own as a salad or side dish for chicken or fish. Add a handful of slices to vegetables or fish you are deep-frying: they emerge crisp lemony wafers.  If you can't find them here, you might mention to a friend on the West Coast that mailing a small package costs less than one might think.  With a bowlful of lemons on the table, who needs bottled juice? They last for several weeks, good for glazing a cake, zipping up a soup or dressing a salad.  And as you walk by, reach out, scratch the skin and inhale -- suddenly, regardless of the weather outside, you're in a lemon grove.  Spaghetti al Limone  Time: 45 minutes  1 lemon  11/2 cups dry white wine  3/4 to 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, to taste  1 pound spaghetti  3 tablespoons butter, in pieces  3 1/2 to 4 ounces Parmesan cheese, freshly grated  1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, to taste  Sea salt and fresh black pepper, to taste.  1. Zest lemon and slice zest into matchsticks. Juice lemon, strain and reserve. Place zest in large nonreactive pan with wine and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium high and cook until it reduces to a syrupy mixture, about 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes.  2. Remove from heat and pour in about 1/4 cup of cream. Stir, then pour in remaining cream. Return to stove and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until it is thickened and reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.  3. Meanwhile, bring large pot of generously salted water to boil. Cook pasta until al dente; reserve 1/2 cup cooking water and drain.  4. Return hot pasta pot to stove. Pour in cream, butter and lemon juice, stir, then add hot drained pasta and a few tablespoons of cooking water. Toss together and add cheese in three or four parts, tossing each to meld with sauce. Add more cooking water if sauce is too thick and crumbly.  5. Ladle onto plates and drizzle each portion with olive oil, then add a little salt and pepper.  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.  Lemon Confit Shortbread Tart  Time: At least 2 hours  For the crust:  3 cups flour  1 teaspoon salt  1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces  1 1/4 cups sugar  1 large egg  1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, or to taste  2 tablespoons lemon juice  For the confit:  8 lemons, preferably thin-skinned and seedless  3/4 cup sugar.  1. For crust, combine flour, salt, butter and 1 cup of sugar in a bowl. Mix with your fingers until it forms flaky crumbs and lumps. Mix in egg, almond extract and lemon juice. Continue to mix until it clumps; at first it may seem very dry. Shape into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 day ahead of baking.  2. For confit, slice off and discard ends of lemons. Slice 5 crosswise, peel and all, as thinly as possible. Remove any seeds and place in a bowl. Peel skin, including white pith, from remaining 3 lemons, then slice thinly crosswise, and add to bowl. Add 3/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Toss and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.  3. Place lemon slices and their juice in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook down until lemons are candied and small amount of liquid in pan is sticky and syrupy, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.  4. To bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide dough in half and form each half into a ball. Roll one ball until large enough to fit into a 9-inch round tart pan. Dough will be crumbly (more shortbread than pie crust); if it falls apart, press it back together. Spoon confit over crust, spreading evenly. Roll out second ball of dough and place on top, sealing edges but making sure no crust overlaps the rim (or tart will be difficult to remove later).  5. Bake until edges of tart are lightly golden, about 35 minutes, then sprinkle top with remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Return to oven for about 10 more minutes; edges should be lightly golden and crust cooked through but not browned. Serve warm or cooled.  Yield: 8 to 10 servings.  Chicken Breasts with Fennel and Lemon  Time: 45 minutes  1 lemon  1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts  Salt to taste  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1 medium large fennel bulb, sliced lengthwise and cut in strips  1 1/2 cups dry white wine such as pinot grigio  1 cup chicken broth  1 pinch cinnamon (about 1/8 teaspoon)  2 egg yolks.  1. Zest lemon and slice zest into matchsticks. Juice lemon, strain and reserve.  2. Lightly sprinkle chicken with salt. Put deep frying pan over medium-high heat, pour in oil and gently saut\u00e9 chicken breasts, about two minutes per side, until they are about half-cooked. Remove from pan.  3. Pour off oil and discard, then add fennel, wine and lemon zest to pan. Bring to boil over high heat and cook until wine is reduced by about half and fennel is tender. Add broth and cinnamon, bring to boil and cook about 5 minutes to reduce sauce a bit.  4. Add chicken with its juices and cook for 2 or 3 minutes.  5. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat egg yolks with half the juice (about 1 tablespoon), then ladle in about 1/4 cup of sauce. Mix well, then add to pan, mixing well. Cook over medium heat, stirring a bit, until sauce appears creamy. Taste and add more juice, if you like.  Yield: 4 servings.",

            "fulltext": "IT'S right there, invisible, inside your oven, the most underappreciated, taken-for-granted appliance in your kitchen: the broiler.  Bread machines, microwaves, sandwich-makers, electric grills and other ''must-haves'' come and go, but the broiler is always there. Hundreds of books are written about grilling, roasting, frying, even microwaving and steaming, for crying out loud, yet the broiler is largely ignored.  The broiler is free -- that is to say, you already own one -- and easy to use. It is essentially an upside-down grill, but it produces results you cannot duplicate any other way. It even has a couple of distinct advantages over the outdoor grill and the countertop version.  As a boy, I watched my mother broil almost every night in our oversize ''rotisserie,'' which took up half the counter space in our modest Manhattan apartment. (I fear that she, too, was a victim of gadget marketing; our oven broiler remained unused.)  As a young food writer, freed from the constraints of the city, I wrote about the joys of wintertime grilling. As a middle-aged food writer, I'm writing about the benefits of wintertime broiling: you don't have to brave the weather, and you get a warmer kitchen. All you need to do is turn a dial (or, these days, frustratingly, push a couple of buttons, one of them several times). And -- a real bonus that you do not get with grilling, either indoor or outdoor -- the juices of whatever you're broiling stay in the pan.  You've probably seen cookbook directions that start ''on the grill or under the broiler,'' as if they were the same thing. Broiling, though, requires some different techniques, and it's taken me some time and a little rewriting of the rules to optimize my skills.  First of all, forget about broiler pans and aluminum foil. As everyone knows, the pan is nearly impossible to clean (which explains the aluminum foil), and it's designed to allow the valuable juices -- mostly fat, but, hey, fat is flavor -- drip through the grate and into the bottom. What good are the juices doing you there? The problem with most of today's meat is not too much fat but too little, so there's no need to get rid of it.  Another problem with broiler pans is that they trap air under the food, keeping the underside cool, which makes turning necessary, increases cooking time, and reduces browning. By using a skillet instead, you eliminate all these problems.  Most modern broilers are now unfortunately equipped with thermostats, so they cycle on and off, never really getting hot enough. Start by heating your oven to its maximum temperature, typically 550 degrees; then turn on the broiler.  While the oven is preheating, leave a skillet or a grill pan (a ridged skillet) inside. The best pans for this are cast-iron, enameled cast-iron, or heavy-duty steel -- not stainless steel, but what chefs call ''black steel.'' Almost needless to say, this pan must be all metal and not flimsy. Keep potholders handy.  In most cases, that skillet will stay as close to the heating element as possible, about two or three inches away. That's roughly the distance you want if you have an old-fashioned under-oven broiler, even though it will allow you to put the food closer, almost in contact with the flames. Adjustments may also be needed with a really powerful broiler, of the kind more often found in restaurants, where two or three inches may be way too close. After a little experimenting, you'll find the ideal distance for your broiler. (My broiler, on which all of my calculations are based, is 17,000 B.T.U., and is typical. Some broilers, including most electric ones, are closer to 10,000 B.T.U.)  Finally, do what it takes to keep the broiling element on. Most broiling happens so fast -- often in less than 10 minutes -- that if the element cycles off, it will throw off your timing. It's not disastrous, but it's a nuisance. I have taken to shoving the skillet as far back on the oven rack as I can, and leaving the oven door open a crack.  Now you're ready. What can you cook? Almost anything, although some foods are more cooperative than others: meat of all kinds, especially steaks and chops; fish, from steaks like tuna or swordfish to fillets both thick and thin; shellfish; chicken (usually best without skin, which, as every experienced griller knows, readily catches fire); and even vegetables, especially tomatoes, peppers and chilies.  The technique varies little from one ingredient to the next. For one-inch steaks (rib-eye or sirloin are best), have the meat at room temperature and dry it well. Broil in a preheated skillet about eight minutes for medium rare; turning is unnecessary. You may want to serve it bottom-side up, especially if you use a grill pan.  For one-inch fish steaks or thick fillets, brush the fish lightly with olive oil first. Cooking time for medium to medium well will be less than 10 minutes.  Boneless, skinless chicken breasts will take five or six minutes, less if they're thin. Thighs need about 10 minutes; you may have to move the oven rack down a notch if they brown too quickly.  Turn scallops or shrimp in extra virgin olive oil and salt before broiling for about three minutes. Simply toss clams or mussels into the preheated skillet. They're done when they open, within 10 minutes. If shells start to crack, remove the open mollusks and return the pan to the oven.  Thin fish fillets, like flounder, are a little different. Preheat the pan for about five minutes, remove it, and pour in about three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, then put the fillets in the oil. Time under the broiler will be 90 seconds to 2 minutes, rarely more.  There. If I'd told you I had an appliance that could brown like a grill, was as convenient as your oven, and cooked most food in less than 10 minutes, you'd buy it. But you don't need to.  Hard-Shell Clams with Parsley Pesto  Time: 20 minutes  2 cups parsley leaves (thin stems are O.K.), washed  Salt  1/2 clove garlic, more to taste  1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, or more  1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or lemon juice  2 dozen hardshell clams (littlenecks or cherrystones), washed and scrubbed.  1. Turn on broiler and put a large cast-iron skillet under it while you make parsley pesto. Combine parsley with a pinch of salt, garlic and about half the oil in a food processor or blender. Process, stopping to scrape down sides of container if necessary, and adding rest of oil gradually. Add vinegar or lemon juice, then a little water to thin mixture slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning.  2. Carefully remove skillet from broiler, add clams to it and return to broiler. They should all open more or less at once, within 10 minutes; remove them as soon as they do to preserve their juices, and put on a plate. Dab each with parsley sauce and serve hot. (Any clams that do not open are safe to eat; open them with a dull knife, or continue to broil a few minutes longer.)  Yield: 4 or more servings.  Tortilla Soup  Time: 1 hour  2 fresh chilies, preferably pasilla  1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, each cut in half  2 tablespoons neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn  3 cloves garlic, sliced  1 large onion, sliced  Salt and freshly ground pepper  Pinch dried oregano  4 cups any stock or water  1 to 2 cups tortilla chips  1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped, optional  1 ripe avocado, peeled and sliced, optional  1 or 2 radishes, thinly sliced, optional  1 lime, juiced, plus one cut into wedges.  1. Heat broiler. Arrange chilies and tomatoes in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and place a few inches away from broiling element. Cook until charred on one side, then flip them with tongs and char other side, about 5 to 8 minutes total. When cool, skin, stem and seed chilies, then chop them.  2. Put oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; a minute later add garlic and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and softened, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and chilies, crushing tomatoes with back of a wooden spoon. Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of oregano; add stock or water and adjust heat so mixture simmers gently. Cook for 20 to 30 minutes, crushing tomatoes from time to time. (You can prepare soup up to this point in advance. Let it sit for a few hours, or cover and refrigerate for up to a day before reheating and finishing.)  3. Stir in tortilla chips and simmer another three to five minutes. Season to taste with lime juice, salt and pepper, then garnish if desired and serve with lime wedges.  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.  Broiled Steak with Pineapple and Onion Salsa  Time: 30 minutes  1 pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into thick rings (canned rings are O.K.; drain excess syrup)  1 large onion, cut into thick slices  3 tablespoons olive oil  1 tablespoon minced fresh chile, like jalape\u00f1o or Thai, or to taste, or dried red chile flakes or cayenne to taste  2 tablespoons chopped basil or mint leaves  2 tablespoons lime juice  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 12- to 16-ounce sirloin strip or ribeye steaks, preferably at room temperature.  1. Start broiler; set rack about 4 inches from heat source. Brush pineapple and onion slices with olive oil and put on a baking sheet. Broil, turning once or twice, until soft and slightly charred, about 8 minutes total. Remove slices as they finish cooking and chop into bite-size chunks, saving as much juice as possible. When finished, set a cast-iron pan under broiler and let sit for about 10 minutes.  2. In a bowl, combine pineapple and onions with chile, basil and lime juice. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir to combine. Let sit for about 5 minutes, then taste and add more chile, lime or salt to taste.  3. Season steaks with salt and pepper. When pan is very hot, carefully remove from oven and add steaks; return to oven immediately. Broil steaks 6 to 10 minutes for rare to medium rare. (Timing will depend on thickness of meat and broiler heat; check by feel or by making a small slit in one steak and peeking in.) Serve steaks hot, with salsa.  Yield: 4 servings.  THE MINIMALIST",

Lately they have been smoking everything in reach -- onions, tomatoes, chicken, fish, maple syrup. Some invest in professional indoor smokers, but the majority do what a home cook can easily do, rig a roasting pan with aluminum foil or use inexpensive gear like Camerons stovetop smokers.  After a 20-minute smoke and then a flash in a hot pan, chicken thighs taste like they are straight off the grill, but smokier, juicier and -- depending on how you get your smoke -- more interesting.  And the technique fills kitchens not with smoke, but with a cozy aroma, like potpourri, with Pavlovian effects.  Makeshift or manufactured, stovetop smokers work the same way. Sprinkle wood chips, either the finely shaved ones Camerons packages or another brand, on the bottom of the pan, top them with a drip tray or foil that doesn't quite reach the edge of the pan, and a rack to hold food. Set the pan over medium low heat, slide the smoker shut or cover it with foil. If wisps of smoke seep out, use more foil.  Smoking, and smokehouses, originated as a means of food preservation, but cooks worldwide have figured out how to impart hints of wood and spice to food in their own homes. Chinese cookbooks often explain how to convert woks into smokers. There's an Indian method called dhungar, which involves setting tiny bowls of smoldering charcoal within covered casseroles of cooked food.  Pichet Ong has used a similar method to smoke cream and flour at Spice Market, and now makes spice-scented beeswax candles to smoke desserts tableside at his coming restaurant, P*Ong.  Stovetop smoking actually cooks food, rather than just flavoring it. (Flavoring is the point of cold-smoking, in which ingredients are placed in smoke-filled chambers away from heat.) In a stovetop smoker, lean meats like the ones I'm inclined to wrap in bacon or baste in butter become far more complex without additional fat. And smoke offsets the intensity of richer meats and seafood, like pork shoulder and bluefish.  Foods smoked on the stove develop a intensely flavorful patina. Wondering what was in this delicious soot, I called Camerons headquarters, in Colorado Springs. Anne Malone, who founded the company with her husband in 1983 and runs it with five employees, answered the phone. ''That's steam that's been colored by wood smoke,'' she said. Is it safe? She said a drip tray prevents fat from dripping onto burning embers, which would create more hazardous smoke.  Smoking doesn't generate the levels of carcinogenic chemicals that ''are concentrated when there are fats and higher temperatures,'' said Barry Swanson, professor of food science and nutrition at Washington State University. Other research has found that levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a hazardous component of smoke, are minimal if wood smolders (as it does in stovetop smoking), and doesn't flame.  This is encouraging because smoking is fun. After enjoying a memorable brined, tea-and-spice-smoked chicken at the restaurant Lantern, in Chapel Hill, N.C., I smoked my way through my pantry, tossing star anise, cinnamon, rice and sugar in with the tea.  Earl Grey imparted a lip-tingling, bergamot tang to chicken thighs, but Lapsang souchong was overpowering. Lantern's chef and owner, Andrea Reusing, uses jasmine tea, which is milder and floral.  The technique inspires experimentation. After buying half a dozen kinds of wood chips (available at cameronssmoker.com or any of the many kitchenware stores that sell the smokers) I learned that hickory works best with pork, alder with salmon, and fruit woods with mild fish.  Matt Weingarten, chef de cuisine at Savoy in SoHo, brines then smokes sturgeon with juniper branches and berries. Eben Copple, chef at Jovia, smokes cauliflower with rosemary stems, which imparts a piney flavor.  Ethan Kostbar, chef at Rose Water in Brooklyn, smokes so much -- chocolate for the ice cream, limes for a shrimp sauce, parsnips with venison -- that he's devoting a five-course dinner to the technique tomorrow.  These new approaches get smoke in places you least expect to find it, but they are just as trusty with traditional recipes.  One frigid January afternoon, Elizabeth Karmel, author of the book ''Taming the Flame'' (Wiley, 2005), had half-a-dozen stovetop smokers going at the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan as she prepared to teach a class on Southern barbecue.  One smoker was tented with foil instead of the usual metal lid. When she peeled the foil back, it revealed as burnished a pork shoulder as I've seen sweating on grates of old-school smoke pits. Into the oven it went, to finish its trip toward succulent pulled pork. (Most of the rest of the smokers harbored catfish, which she brines with Budweiser and whips into a fluffy Southern cousin to whitefish salad.)  When I made her pork recipe at home, my husband declared our days of shipping up Southern barbecue over. And now we wouldn't have to spend sweltering summer afternoons huddled over our kettle grill, hydrating ourselves with ice-cold beer in dizzying clouds of smoke, I added.  ''Nah,'' he said. ''I wouldn't go that far.''  North Carolina-Style Pulled Pork  Adapted from Elizabeth Karmel  Time: 5 to 6 hours  For the pork:  3 tablespoons hickory-wood shavings  16- to 9-pound bone-in pork shoulder or Boston butt  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  For the sauce:  2 cups cider vinegar  1 tablespoon salt  1 tablespoon ground white pepper  1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper  1/2 to 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes  2 tablespoons white sugar  1/4 cup brown sugar  1/2 cup ketchup.  1. Place hickory chips in center of smoker or roasting pan and top with drip tray and rack. Massage pork all over with a lot of salt and pepper. Place on rack, skin-side up. Cover with two long pieces of heavy-duty foil that have been folded together tightly at long seams. Crimp foil around edges of smoker, leaving enough space between pork and foil so smoke can circulate. Turn heat to medium and smoke for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on size and your taste. Shut off heat and rest, covered, for 5 minutes.  2. While pork is smoking, preheat oven to 300 degrees. Whisk together sauce ingredients in a large bowl, season to taste and refrigerate.  3. Remove foil from smoker and transfer rack and pork to a sheet pan. Place in oven. Cook for 40 minutes per pound (about 4 to 5 hours), until a meat thermometer inserted into the middle of the roast registers 190 degrees. Remove pork and rest until cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes. While still warm, pull meat away from bones. Discard skin, fat and bones, and reserve crispy browned bits of fat and crust. Working quickly on a large cutting board, shred chunks of meat, pulling it with forks or fingers into long strands. Add reserved crispy bits and chop meat roughly. Transfer to a serving bowl, season with 1/2 to 3/4 cup sauce, and mix well.  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.  Smoked Catfish Salad  Adapted from Elizabeth Karmel  Time: About 30 minutes  2 teaspoons hickory- or alder-wood shavings  3 pounds catfish fillets  1 8-ounce block cream cheese  1/2 to 3/4 cup sour cream  2 large shallots, finely minced  2 tablespoons capers in liquid  1 teaspoon caper juice  1 teaspoon granulated garlic  5 shakes Tabasco  6 grinds freshly ground pepper, or more to taste  Salt, to taste.  1. Place wood shavings in center of smoker; top with drip pan and rack. Add catfish, leaving enough room between fillets so smoke can circulate. Place on stove over medium heat and smoke for 20 to 25 minutes. Shut off heat and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Catfish should be fully cooked and bronzed, with crisp edges.  2. While fillets are still warm, break them into pieces in a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Taste for seasoning, adding more sour cream if too dry. Serve immediately or refrigerate and serve cool.  Yield: At least 5 appetizer portions.  Note: Recipe is for large smoker, but can be halved for a smaller smoker.  Tea-Smoked Chicken Thighs With Pomegranate Glaze  Time: About 30 minutes  2 small oranges or tangerines  2 heaping teaspoons loose leaf tea (both Earl Grey and jasmine work well)  4 to 6 star anise pods  1 cinnamon stick (optional)  2 to 2 1/2 pounds skin-on chicken thighs  Freshly ground black pepper and salt, to taste  1/4 cup hoisin sauce  1 1/2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses  Sriracha chili sauce, to taste  2 tablespoons canola oil.  1. Zest one orange and peel other; set zest and peels aside. Cut oranges in half and squeeze juice through wire mesh strainer into a bowl. Reserve juice.  2. Scatter orange peels, tea, star anise and cinnamon around center of bottom of smoker. Cover with drip tray and wire rack. Arrange thighs on rack and season generously with pepper and salt. Place on stove over medium heat and after first wisp of smoke appears, cover tightly with lid. Smoke for 20 to 25 minutes. Shut off heat and rest for 5 minutes with lid on.  3. While chicken is smoking, combine zest, hoisin, pomegranate molasses and sriracha in a small bowl. Add about half reserved juice, more if sauce is too thick. Set glaze aside.  4. Pour oil in a nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron pan over medium high heat. When hot, add chicken, and cook about three minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium low, brush both sides of chicken with glaze, and cook for another few minutes until crisp. Serve immediately, with extra sauce on the side.  Yield: 4 entr\u00e9e portions.",

            "fulltext": "THE CLAIM -- Hot leftovers should cool at room temperature.  THE FACTS -- What to do with leftovers? One common bromide is that leftovers stored in the refrigerator must be allowed to cool first at room temperature.  The reasoning behind the claim varies. One theory is that allowing food to cool at a slower rate reduces the likelihood that it will spoil. Another suggests that hot food can somehow interfere with the circulation of cold air in the refrigerator. The notion may have originated back when food was stored in iceboxes, and thus could not be too hot when put away.  Whatever the rationale, the claim is wrong. According to the Food and Drug Administration, leftover food (particularly meat) should be refrigerated immediately after serving, and certainly within two hours of cooking.  Food bacteria can double every 30 or 40 minutes, and several outbreaks of food poisoning have been linked to meat cooked and left to cool at room temperature for too long.  Generally, the bacteria that contaminate food thrive at temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, so leftovers should always be stored in a refrigerator set at 40 degrees or below.  When the quantity of food is large, it should be separated into small containers for quicker cooling, and reheated no more than once.  THE BOTTOM LINE -- It's a bad idea to let food sit at room temperature before refrigerating.  ANAHAD O'CONNOR  Really? scitimes@nytimes.com",

            "fulltext": "ISA CHANDRA MOSKOWITZ, a vegan chef, does not particularly like to talk about tofu. Ditto seitan, tempeh and nutritional yeast.  ''I think vegan cooks need to learn to cook vegetables first,'' she said last week during a cupcake-baking marathon. ''Then maybe they can be allowed to move on to meat substitutes.''  Ms. Moskowitz, 34, was born in Coney Island Hospital, lives in Brooklyn, and is a typically impatient and opinionated New Yorker. She can't stand how slowly most cooks peel garlic, makes relentless fun of Rachael Ray and rolls her eyes at the mention of California hippies.  But as a vegan and a follower of punk music since age 14, she is also part of a culinary movement that helped turn the chaotic energy of punk culture of the 1970s and 1980s into a progressive political force.  ''Punk taught me to question everything,'' Ms. Moskowitz said. ''Of course, in my case that means questioning how to make a Hostess cupcake without eggs, butter or cream.''  The charm of Ms. Moskowitz -- in person, in her cookbooks and on her public-access television cooking show, the Post-Punk Kitchen (theppk.com/shows/) -- is that she makes even the deprivations of veganism and the rage of punk seem like fun. Like feminism that embraces makeup and miniskirts -- the frivolous bits -- Ms. Moskowitz's veganism embraces chocolate, white flour, confectioners' sugar, and food coloring.  Wearing a black ''Made Out of Babies'' T-shirt (it's a friend's band) above a red-and-white checked apron, she bent maternally over a batch of strawberry cupcakes. ''Don't you just want to pinch their little cupcake cheeks,'' she said.  But can a cupcake be cute and punk at the same time? In the early days of punk, bands like the Sex Pistols were notorious for nihilism, anarchism and epic consumption of drugs and alcohol -- none of which would seem to lead to tofu and chamomile tea. But as punk became more political (and as bands self-destructed) in the 1990s, many punks adopted a more profoundly rebellious stance: against drugs, against alcohol and against the whole habit of mindless consumption.  ''It was about purifying the movement, about being poison-free,'' said Ted Leo, of Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, who led the band Chisel in the 1990s. He became vegetarian in 1988 and has been vegan since 1998. Many punks became vegetarian to protest corporate and government control of the food supply. Veganism takes vegetarianism farther into cruelty-free territory by avoiding anything produced by animals: milk, cheese, eggs, honey, etc.  ''I would love to live in a world where I knew the eggs came from happy chickens,'' Ms. Moskowitz said. ''But in Brooklyn? That's not going to happen.  ''Besides, eggs are the big lie in baking. All the books say they provide structure, but that's kind of crap.''  At 16, Ms. Moskowitz dropped out of the High School of Music and Art in New York to follow bands, live in squats in the East Village and cook for social justice.  ''I learned knife skills by cooking for Food not Bombs,'' she said, referring to the activist group that protests corporate and government food policy. ''But I also learned to love Julia Child and Martha Stewart. Vegan food can and must be pretty,'' she said, pounding a fist on the butcher-block counter.  Ms. Moskowitz's kitchen, like punk music itself, has a strong do-it-yourself aesthetic. Her husband, a carpenter, builds more shelves when the ingredients threaten to take over, the oven needs frequent coaxing to get up to temperature, and if Fizzle the cat wants to sit on top of the refrigerator, the cupcakes must move over and make room.  ''Here is the hideous curdled face of vegan baking,'' Ms. Moskowitz said, gesturing to a bowl of soy milk mixed with vegetable oil and cider vinegar. Baking, she said, has long been the final frontier for vegan cooks.  Her second cookbook, ''Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World,'' was published by Marlowe and Company last fall. Her first, ''Vegan With a Vengeance'' (Marlowe, 2005), has sold more than 50,000 copies.  ''Omnivores'' -- that's meat-and-dairy eaters -- ''can't imagine baking without eggs and butter,'' she said. ''But we use cider vinegar instead of buttermilk for tenderizing, and really good shortening for the fat, and the rest just happens.'' Nonhydrogenated shortening and margarine produced by Earthbalance and full-fat soy milk from Silk are her baking staples.  From them, instead of lumpy, penitential scones and muffins (the usual vegan baked goods) Ms. Moskowitz and her co-author Terry Hope Romero produce insanely fetching cupcakes with mousse fillings, butter cream frostings, chocolate ganache icings and sprinkles galore.  Ms. Moskowitz says that she has received passionate e-mail messages not only from vegans but also from parents of children allergic to eggs or dairy products, who are thrilled to find vegan baked goods that are not made with whole-wheat flour and egg substitutes and that actually taste good.  The next book by the two women, to be published in the fall, will be ''the long-awaited vegan Joy of Cooking,'' Ms. Moskowitz said. ''Vegan food is everywhere.''  In the recipes below, North African spices lighten a rich vegetable stew with a peanut base; sweet butternut squash stands in perfectly for the sweet shrimp in an otherwise traditional Vietnamese spring roll.  Ms. Moskowitz and Ms. Romero both have been vegetarian since age 16, and vegan for almost that long. ''It's kind of like being gay, in that vegans tend to remember an 'aha' moment in adolescence or childhood,'' Ms. Moskowitz said. ''It happens when you realize that the lambs or chickens on your plate are the same as the ones at the petting zoo.''  It is also like being gay in that, 20 years ago, the notion of a vegetarian teenager was far more alien than it is today.  ''People used to throw chicken nuggets at me in the cafeteria,'' said Ms. Romero, who grew up in Plainville, Conn.  The number of adult vegetarians has remained steady at 2 to 3 percent, the Vegetarian Resource Group has found in 10 years of regular polling. But American teenagers have been taking up vegetarianism in growing numbers.  In a 2005 Harris Interactive poll for the group, 10 percent of girls ages 13 to 18 said they ''never'' ate meat, poultry or seafood.  In a 2006 poll of 100,000 college students by the food service giant Aramark, 30 percent of all students said that it was ''very important'' to them to have vegetarian food options on campus, up from 26 percent in 2004.  But punk vegans like Ms. Moskowitz and Mr. Leo acknowledge that they are still far outside the mainstream, and that the label ''vegan'' -- unlike ''vegetarian'' -- can still inspire a strong negative reaction.  ''Any time you confront a deeply ingrained societal norm, people are going to get upset,'' Mr. Leo said.  Ms. Moskowitz agreed that the vegan movement is in need of a public-relations overhaul. ''I can't say there's no self-righteousness in the movement, and also, a lot of the food is awful.''  She said vegans should stop whining about what they can and can't eat, and start cooking. ''When someone invites you to dinner, bring something delicious, and share it,'' she said.  This peaceable approach -- smoothing frosting over the rough edges of rage -- might be the key to Ms. Moskowitz's appeal.  ''You can't stay angry forever,'' she said. ''Either as a punk or as a vegan.''  Butternut Squash Rice Paper Rolls  Adapted from Isa Chandra Moskowitz  Time: 45 minutes  For the rolls:  1 pound butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes  1 tablespoon olive oil  4 ounces vermicelli rice noodles or rice sticks  12 8-inch round rice paper wrappers  1/3 cup roasted salted pumpkin seeds or peanuts, coarsely chopped  1 cup cilantro leaves and thin stems, torn into bite-size pieces  For the dipping sauce:  1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce  2 tablespoons rice vinegar  2 teaspoons sugar  2 tablespoons Asian hot chili oil  2 teaspoons sesame oil.  1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Place squash on a baking sheet, drizzle with oil and spread in a single layer. Roast 15 minutes, toss gently and return to oven until tender and caramelized, about 10 more minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.  2. Meanwhile, prepares noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat, add noodles, and allow to sit for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water; set aside.  3. To assemble rolls: Fill a large pie plate or shallow bowl with very warm tap water. Lay a clean, damp kitchen towel on counter to use as a work surface; this will prevent wrappers from sliding. Submerge two paper wrappers in the water to soften, about 1 minute. Gently transfer one wrapper to towel.  4. In lower third of circle, place a small handful of noodles, leaving about an inch and a half of empty wrapper on either side. Place two or three pieces of squash on top of noodles, and sprinkle with pumpkin seeds and cilantro. To roll, fold left and right sides of wrapper snugly over the filling. Lift the bottom of the wrapper over the filling, tucking it underneath, then roll up firmly but gently. Place seam side down on a plate, and continue with remaining wrappers and filling. Cut in half when ready to serve.  5. For dipping sauce: In a small bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon soy sauce, the vinegar and sugar. Add chili oil and sesame oil, and taste. If desired, add additional soy sauce.  Yield: 12 rolls.  Devil's Food Cupcakes with Fluffy White Filling and Chocolate Icing  Adapted from ''Vegan With a Vengeance,'' by Isa Chandra Moskowitz (Marlowe, 2005)  Time: 1 hour 45 minutes  For the cupcakes:  Nonstick cooking spray  1 cup all-purpose flour  1/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder  3 tablespoons black cocoa powder (see note) or more Dutch-process cocoa powder  1 teaspoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  1/4 teaspoon salt  1 cup plain soy milk  1/4 cup canola oil  1/2 cup pure maple syrup  1/4 cup sugar  1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  For the filling:  1/3 cup nonhydrogenated margarine, such as Earthbalance  1/3 cup nonhydrogenated shortening  2 1/2 to 3 cups confectioners' sugar  2 teaspoons vanilla extract  For the chocolate icing:  1/3 cup plain soy milk  4 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped  2 tablespoons pure maple syrup or confectioners' sugar  For the royal icing:  2 cups confectioners' sugar  1 to 2 tablespoons plain soy milk.  1. For the cupcakes: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-muffin pan with paper liners, and spray lightly with nonstick spray. In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a mixer, combine the soy milk, oil, syrup, sugar, vinegar and vanilla. Mix at medium speed for 2 minutes. Add half the dry ingredients and mix to blend. Add remaining dry ingredients and mix for 1 minute.  2. Use a standard ice cream scoop to fill cupcake liners 3/4 full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.  3. For the filling: In a mixer, beat margarine and shortening until combined. Add 21/2 cups confectioners' sugar and beat until very fluffy, about 10 minutes. Taste for sweetness and add remaining 1/2 cup sugar if desired. Add vanilla and beat for 1 minute more.  4. For the chocolate icing: In a small skillet, bring soy milk to a simmer. Reduce heat to very low and stir in the chocolate and maple syrup, stirring until just melted. Turn off heat.  5. For the royal icing: Using an electric mixer or by hand, sift sugar into a bowl and add 1 tablespoon soy milk. Mix, adding up to 1 more tablespoon soy milk until consistency is like stiff toothpaste.  6. To assemble: Prepare two pastry bags, one fitted with a large plain tip, and one with a small writing tip. Fill large-tipped bag with filling, and the small-tipped bag with royal icing. (Instead of pastry bags, thick resealable plastic bags may be used. For filling, cut off one corner of bag so the opening measures a scant 1/2 inch across. For icing, opening should be just large enough to pipe a thin line.)  7. Using your pinkie, poke a hole in center of each cupcake top about an inch deep. Push tip of pastry bag with filling into each hole, firmly squeezing in filling and slowly drawing tip up and out. When all cakes have been filled, wipe off any excess that sticks out from holes; tops of cupcakes should be flat.  8. Place cupcakes on a baking sheet or tray that fits in refrigerator. Rewarm pan of chocolate icing over low heat if necessary, stirring constantly. Dip top of each cupcake into icing, swirling to coat completely. When all cupcakes are dipped, refrigerate 10 to 15 minutes to set. When set, use royal icing to make squiggles across center of each cupcake. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve, up to 1 day.  Yield: 12 cupcakes.  Note: Black cocoa, which gives the cake its characteristic dark color and bittersweet flavor, is available from King Arthur Flour, (800) 827-6836, kingarthurflour.com  Spicy Peanut Stew with Ginger and Tomato  Adapted from Terry Hope Romero  Time: One hour  1 medium-size eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice  1 teaspoon salt, more to taste  1 teaspoon ground cumin  1 teaspoon ground coriander  1/4 teaspoon turmeric  1/8 teaspoon cayenne  1/4 cup peanut oil  2 shallots, thinly sliced  2 inches fresh ginger, peeled and minced  1 to 2 jalape\u00f1o chilies, seeded and minced  1 onion, chopped  1/3 cup tomato paste  1 small (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, preferably roasted  4 cups vegetable stock or water  1/2 cup natural unsweetened peanut butter (creamy or chunky)  1 medium-size zucchini, 6 to 8 ounces, cut in quarters lengthwise, then sliced 1/2 -inch thick  2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (1 to 2 lemons)  1/3 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves, plus whole leaves for garnish  Cooked rice, for serving  Chopped roasted salted peanuts, for garnish (optional).  1. In a colander, toss eggplant with 1 teaspoon salt; set aside for 30 minutes. Rinse, drain well and set aside. In a small bowl, combine cumin, coriander, turmeric and cayenne; set aside.  2. In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add shallots and fry, stirring often, until soft, crisp and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots to a large bowl, leaving oil in pot. Raise heat to high and add eggplant. Cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and just tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to bowl with shallots.  3. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to pot and heat over medium-high heat. Add ginger and chilies and cook, stirring for 30 seconds. Add spices and cook, stirring, 30 seconds more. Add onion and cook, stirring to scrape up any browned bits, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  4. Add diced tomatoes, stock or water, eggplant, shallots and a sprinkling of salt. Bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes. Place peanut butter in a medium bowl, addone or two ladlefuls of hot soup, and stir until emulsified, then pour mixture back into soup.  5. Reduce heat to a simmer, add zucchini, cover and cook 10 to 15 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Turn off heat and stir in lemon juice and chopped cilantro. Let cool slightly and taste; add salt if necessary. Serve in bowls with rice, garnished with cilantro leaves and chopped peanuts, if desired.  Yield: 8 servings.",

Most products state a range of temperatures. However, none I have seen state a warning that products not be used under the broiler.  We had an oven fire due to browning a piece of pastry that had been baked on a silicone liner. The baking part was fine, and to brown under the broiler, we just left the silicone mat under the pastry. But that resulted in an oven fire within less than a minute.  Although we had no fire extinguisher at hand, the fire burned itself out within five minutes. But it left us with a stove that needed replacing and a kitchen that needed complete cleaning and painting.

            "fulltext": "DARK brown, rich with a hint of sweetness. Altbier fits that description. So does onion soup. And the two can certainly be in harmony.  During the tasting Eric Asimov hinted that he would like a pretzel recipe for these ales, so I decided to make pretzel dumplings with cheese to serve in the soup instead of the usual toasted French bread covered with cheese.  It turned out to be a fine package. While tasting the ales, I thought their malty, toasted, spicy flavors, with bitterness that sometimes suggested buckwheat and burnt caramel, would go with other soups, like lentil, and with pungent washed-rind cheeses.  The onion soup I made followed a fairly classic recipe, though I deglazed the onions with some ale for another synergistic touch. There is ale in the dumplings, too. The recipe for those was based, to some degree, on my formula for matzo balls, which I make with sparkling water. Ale's fizz was a fine substitute. With this combination of ingredients, mustard was a natural seasoning.  The dumplings are best when cooked just before serving so that they can be fished, still hot, from their water bath and plopped into the soup without delay. But they can be drained, held, then reheated by steaming if that is more convenient. You can even steam them over the reheating soup.  The main trick to the soup is not to rush browning the onions. They take time to turn a uniform deep gold. I like what happens when the hot soup is set aside so that the thyme can infuse: there's a rounder touch of herbaceousness. Besides, soups like this are always better when reheated. A splash of lemon juice enlivens the flavor.  Onion Soup With Pretzel-Cheese Dumplings  Time: 11/2 hours, plus 1 hour's infusing  3 tablespoons unsalted butter  3 pounds onions, sliced thin  1 tablespoon sugar  12 ounces dark ale, preferably altbier  6 cups chicken or beef stock  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  Salt and black pepper  4 branches fresh thyme  2 cups packaged pretzel nuggets  1 1/2 cups grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese, more for serving  2 large eggs  1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard.  1. Melt butter in a 4-quart saucepan. Add onions and sugar and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until onions are golden, about 40 minutes. Add 1 cup ale and stir, scraping pot to release caramelized particles. Add stock. Simmer 30 minutes. Add lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Add thyme and set aside one hour or longer to infuse.  2. Pulse pretzels in a food processor or place in a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin to make coarse crumbs. Mix in a bowl with cheese.

            "fulltext": "The Roman Catholic Church leadership of Poland called Friday for all of the country's bishops to be investigated for past ties to the secret police.  ''We will ask a special commission to check the past of all our bishops,'' the Council of Bishops' chief, Jozef Michalski, told reporters in Warsaw after the episcopate's 45 bishops held an emergency meeting to deal with the worst crisis to hit the Polish church in years. It culminated last Sunday, when Warsaw's archbishop of just two days, Stanislaw Wielgus, resigned after admitting that he had collaborated with the reviled Communist-era Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service.  Newspapers digging into archives of the secret police have followed with reports that other senior clergymen were once collaborators. The Rev. Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski, who has researched the subject, is about to come out with a book naming 39 priests, including three bishops, who collaborated with the secret police between 1944 and 1989.  The scandal, which has already tarnished the Catholic Church's image as an unimpeachable moral authority during the Communist years, has caused chaos in a church already divided between liberal and conservative camps.  ''The situation is so difficult, it would be impossible for the bishops to stay silent,'' the Rev. Jozef Kloch, the spokesman of the bishops' council, said on Friday. He said the bishops were discussing a systematic way of dealing with the files.  The revelations have embarrassed the Vatican, which has complained that Bishop Wielgus misled Pope Benedict XVI about the depth of his ties until the Polish news media published his file.  But the Polish church, together with the Vatican under Pope John Paul II, a Pole, has been criticized for keeping collaboration among the clergy quiet -- even though it was widely known inside the church that up to 10 percent of priests, monks and nuns had some contact with the Polish secret police.  Even after the news media began revealing cases of collaboration after John Paul died, the Polish church chose to treat the matter internally.  With Archbishop Wielgus's resignation, the scandal has forced the church to be more aggressive. It is not clear what the church will do with bishops it finds collaborated.",

            "fulltext": "Poland was convulsed in finger-pointing and recrimination on Tuesday as more allegations of former secret-police collaborators among the Roman Catholic clergy members spilled onto the country's front pages, sullying an institution that for decades was considered spotless in its fight against Communism.  And the stream of disclosures now promises to become a torrent: here in Krakow, the Rev. Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski is preparing to publish a book that will identify 39 priests whose names he found in Krakow's secret police files, three of whom are now bishops in the Polish church.  Perhaps the most explosive assertion by people in the church is that the taint of collaboration was known for decades but kept quiet out of respect for -- or perhaps even at the behest of -- the Polish-born Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005.  ''The church didn't want to hurt the pope, but actually, more harm was done by keeping silent,'' Father Zaleski, 50, said in an interview at the hilltop compound of a charity he runs outside Krakow.  The sudden focus on the fallibility of a church thought to be heroically anti-Communist followed the Vatican's choice of Bishop Stanislaw Wielgus as archbishop of Warsaw despite clear signals of his ties to Poland's secret police. Bishop Wielgus resigned Sunday after admitting his secret past.  ''There is a sort of unholy alliance in Poland that has been present for many years, but is fully visible only recently, that is based on a culture of mendacity,'' said Andrzej Zybertowicz, professor of sociology at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, the heart of the Polish church's most conservative camp.  He argued that there were three elements of this alliance: former members of the secret police and the Communist Party who are now active in business and politics; apologists who wanted to forgive and forget past collaboration; and an influential part of the hierarchy of the Polish church.  Collaboration in the clergy is not unique to Poland. Church officials across the Communist world were commonly bent to ignoble service. Some of that has come to light as Eastern bloc countries have peered into their secret police archives.  But Poland is unique in that the church remained stronger there than elsewhere in the Communist world. That was largely because Poland's primate at the time, Archbishop Stefan Wyszynski, agreed to cooperate with the Communist authorities, preaching compromise -- up to a point, beyond which he said the faithful should not yield.  Most researchers who have delved into the archives of the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, estimate that thousands of the country's priests, monks and nuns at the time -- as many as 10 percent of the total -- collaborated with the secret police to some degree.  Poland's current primate and archbishop of Warsaw, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, told an Italian news agency last year that the overall percentage was 15 percent. The percentage was likely to have been much higher in major cities and university towns, some historians say, where surveillance was heavier.  But the most troubling aspect of the recent allegations is how high past collaborators have climbed in the church hierarchy. On Tuesday, the Dziennik newspaper, the third largest daily in the country, reprinted excerpts from a secret 1978 police document concerning a dozen high-ranking church officials -- at least one of whom was a bishop at the time -- indicating that the secret police tried unsuccessfully to influence the appointment of a new primate of Poland, the highest position in the Polish church.  The document gave only code names, like Ramses (cited as a bishop), Professor and Shepherd, but the newspaper promised to disclose those identities soon.  The disclosures have gripped this deeply religious nation -- the largest bloc of devout Roman Catholics left in Europe -- and sparked anger toward the church for letting the frenzied news media disclose them, rather than researching the archives and reporting the findings on its own.  ''The church is guilty because it had the possibility to cleanse itself by publishing honest data about the clergy's activities during the Communist time,'' Father Zaleski said. The church argues that coming to terms with the past is a matter of personal sin that should be handled within the church in a spirit of forgiveness. It also argues that the public disclosure of secret service files on clergy members could do the church harm because many of the documents are false or misleading.  But many people say the church has been overly cautious for fear of tarnishing its Communist-era image as a champion of freedom.  But the church is caught in the dilemma of risking a loss of trust whether it explores the collaboration or continues to treat it as an internal matter. The results could be as bad for the Vatican as they are for the Polish church, because Rome had hoped the church could keep this bastion of the faithful in an otherwise fast secularizing Europe.  Church officials now say that collaboration by some of the Polish clergy members was a quietly understood fact of life under the Communist government that ran Poland from 1944 until 1989.  That was obscured while the pope was still alive. But not even two weeks after his death, in April 2005, the Institute of National Remembrance published documents that showed that the Rev. Konrad Stanislaw Hejmo, a Dominican priest posted to the Vatican, passed information to the secret service's antichurch branch. Father Hejmo admitted giving the information but denied that he was a spy.  During the 25th anniversary celebrations for the Solidarity trade union in Gdansk that August, a friend told Father Zaleski that there was a secret police file on him in Krakow. When he returned to the city, Father Zaleski visited the archives and was stunned to find a file crammed with 500 pages of documents about him.  ''I was shocked by that,'' Father Zaleski said in his garret office. He was even more troubled when he read that two priests had provided the secret police information on his activities. Though the priests were identified only by code names, they were described so precisely, he said, that he knew who they were.  ''I just couldn't imagine that there were priests who had cooperated with the secret police,'' he said.  He sought guidance from the Krakow archbishop, Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, a longtime personal secretary to Pope John Paul II. But Father Zaleski said he was at first ignored and then told to pray. Eventually, his superiors advised that he burn the documents.  ''They weren't interested at all in knowing anything about this,'' he said, rifling through a stack of photocopies stamped by the Institute of National Remembrance.  In a meeting with former Solidarity members at a Krakow-area steel mill last January, Father Zaleski suggested that the church authorities engage in ''lustration,'' as the process of vetting people for past Communist collaboration is known in the former Eastern bloc.  Journalists attending the meeting wrote about Father Zaleski's suggestion. ''It started a storm among the church authorities in Krakow,'' he recalled. ''The archbishop's office published an open letter condemning my activities.'' He decided to undertake the project alone and promised to publish his findings.  The church, meanwhile, publicly acknowledged that some of its clergy members had collaborated and issued an apology for their sins in March. It called on priests, monks and nuns who had collaborated with the secret services to confess -- to the church if not publicly. Seven of the country's 41 Roman Catholic dioceses have since set up commissions to help priests review their files. But none of the commissions has issued a report on its findings.  The disclosures continued, each more shocking than the last. In May, the Rev. Michal Czajkowski, co-president of Poland's Council of Christians and Jews, was accused of having spied for the secret police for 24 years. He resigned his posts and issued an apology.  Next, the press accused the Rev. Mieczyslaw Malinski, a close lifelong friend of Pope John Paul, of collaborating under the code name Delta. Father Malinski admitted having had contacts with the secret police but denied that he was a spy.  When Father Zaleski decided to begin publishing disclosures in May, Cardinal Dziwisz forbade him to do so or to speak to the press because it would undermine ''love for the church and Christ.'' The cardinal issued an order prohibiting any member of the clergy from delving into Krakow's secret police archives without his authorization.  But after he met with Cardinal Dziwisz in June, the archbishop agreed to let him proceed on the condition that Father Zaleski seek comment from the clergymen he intended to identify.  Cardinal Dziwisz could not be reached for comment.  The Rev. Jozef Kloch, the Warsaw episcopate spokesman, said that while Father Zaleski ''can publish whatever he likes, he and his editorial office will be responsible for the consequences.''  Father Zaleski found the 39 priests identified as ''TWs,'' short for tajny wspolpracownik, or secret collaborator. Four of them are now bishops.  Of the 39, 22 answered his request for comment, the majority denying that they were collaborators, and 4 admitting that they were. One of those who he wrote to was the Rev. Janusz Bielanski, who resigned as rector of Wawel Cathedral here on Monday, citing the allegations.  Only one of the bishops responded, and he supplied Father Zaleski with documents that showed he had refused to cooperate with the secret police. But the three bishops who did not respond, along with the other priests, will be identified in his book, which goes to print in mid-February.",

The church, Our Lady Queen of Angels, is one of 21 parishes scheduled to be closed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. The archdiocese is closing parishes and opening a few new ones in response to a shift in the church's membership, mostly toward the city's northern suburbs.  ''You don't go in and sing 'Kumbaya' and the world admires you,'' Peter Borr\u00e9, the activist, who successfully fought parish closings in Boston, told the marchers. ''It's not a walk in the park.'' Our Lady Queen of Angels, on East 113th Street, mainly consists of parishioners from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador.  Most of the marchers yesterday were elderly women clutching rosary beads. But at the head of the march, taking turns holding a staff with a crucifix on one side and a depiction of Mary on the other, were Melinie Martinez, 12, a former altar girl, and her cousin, Jose Rodriguez, also 12.  ''I'm an altar boy,'' he said. ''We're marching because our church is closing. I was baptized there and I had my first communion there and I want to make my confirmation there.''  Mr. Borr\u00e9, 68, co-chairman of a Catholic group in Boston called the Council of Parishes, told the protesters that of 83 Boston parishes scheduled to be closed since 2004, parishioners had successfully lobbied to keep open or to reopen only 10.  The most successful tactics, he said, were attracting media attention; filing appeals under church law; filing lawsuits under civil law; and holding public demonstrations ranging from short-term vigils to round-the-clock sit-ins and occupation of church buildings.  Five parishes in the Boston Archdiocese remain under 24-hour occupation, with dissident parishioners sleeping on the floor, in chairs and on benches, he said. ''I've slept with women whose names I don't even know,'' Mr. Borr\u00e9 said, to applause.  Mr. Borr\u00e9 also has been in contact with parishioners at Mary Help of Christians in the East Village, another of the churches to be closed.  Yesterday, a parishioner asked when Our Lady Queen of Angels was set to close, and another answered, ''March 1,'' prompting gasps.  But Carmen Villegas, a march organizer, said the parish had not yet received an official letter with a closing date.",

            "fulltext": "Warsaw's new archbishop, Stanislaw W. Wielgus, caught in Eastern Europe's widening witch hunt for former Communist secret police informers, admitted Friday that he had collaborated with the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, known as the S.B.  ''Before you today, I confess to the mistake committed by me years ago, just as I have confessed to the Holy Father,'' Bishop Wielgus said in an open letter to Polish Catholics. ''By the fact of this entanglement, I have damaged the church.''  He said he compounded that damage by denying ''facts of this cooperation'' in recent days.  Bishop Wielgus insisted, however, that he had neither spied on anyone nor harmed anyone. He said the only thing he ever did was to inform the secret police of his agenda during foreign academic meetings and to promise not to take part in anti-Communist activities.  He said it was up to Pope Benedict XVI to decide whether he would keep his new job, which he took up Friday.  The bishop is to be officially elevated to archbishop during a ceremony on Sunday in Warsaw at St. John's Cathedral, though many voices in Poland have called for him to step down.  The Warsaw archbishopric is a particularly symbolic institution in the former Soviet bloc. The Polish church, together with the Polish-born Pope John Paul II, were crucial supporters of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement, which helped bring down the totalitarian system and end the cold war.  Confirmation that the archbishop collaborated is doubly troubling because the Polish secret police murdered a charismatic anti-Communist priest from the archdiocese, the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, in 1984. Warsaw's departing archbishop, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, waged a quiet battle with the Communist Party in those years.  Many historians argue that a significant segment of the clergy in Poland and other Eastern bloc countries collaborated to varying degrees with the secret services. Priests have recently been added to those segments of society under scrutiny in several countries during recent efforts to expose former Communist collaborators.  Two years ago, files surfaced showing that the Rev. Mieczyslaw Malinski, who had been close to John Paul II, worked for the S.B. in the 1980s. Several other prominent priests have since been accused of having been informers, and some have admitted that they had links to the secret police. The Polish church publicly apologized last year for priests who collaborated with the S.B., but has tried to keep their names secret.  The uproar over Bishop Wielgus's past began shortly after Pope Benedict picked him in early December to succeed Cardinal Glemp as Warsaw's archbishop. A Polish daily newspaper, Gazeta Polska, reported Dec. 20 that the bishop, 67, had spied on dissidents and fellow clerics for more than two decades, until Communism collapsed in 1989.  Both Bishop Wielgus and the Vatican sought to deflect the accusations by saying his involvement with the secret police had been nothing out of the ordinary for people traveling abroad during the Communist era. Leading representatives of the Polish clergy denounced the accusations against him.  But Poland's human rights ombudsman, Janusz Kochanowski, said Thursday that there was evidence in the secret police archives that Bishop Wielgus had knowingly cooperated with Communist authorities. Rzeczpospolita, one of Poland's most respected newspapers, published documents showing that he had met with police agents more than 50 times in one five-year period.  Even Poland's Catholic Church Historical Commission issued a statement on Friday, saying, ''There are numerous, substantial documents confirming Stanislaw Wielgus's willingness for a conscious and secret cooperation with the Communist security forces.''  The commission said that there was no evidence that Bishop Wielgus's actions harmed anyone, and that the documents would be sent to the Vatican for further study.  Monsignor Wielgus first admitted Friday that he had signed a cooperation statement with the secret police in 1978 under pressure by a ''brutal intelligence officer'' when he was seeking permission to travel to Munich. ''That was my moment of weakness,'' he wrote.  But he accused the secret police of falsifying documents that cast him as a more eager, useful collaborator than he actually was.  ''The personality ascribed to me in the intelligence service documents is so far from the truth that I would never have recognized myself,'' he wrote.  Those claims are not far-fetched. Almost from the moment the Iron Curtain fell, the nations of the former Communist bloc have been steeped in controversies over the files of their secret police forces. The documents are often elliptical and incomplete, and were sometimes embellished by secret police officers eager to impress their superiors, experts say.  The documents published by Rzeczpospolita and other newspapers suggest that Bishop Wielgus was recruited by the S.B. in 1967 when he was a philosophy student at the University of Lublin in eastern Poland, more than a decade before he signed the cooperation agreement. Newspapers cited other documents in which the S.B. claimed he had given them information about activities at the university, where he later served as a professor of medieval philosophy.  The newspapers claimed that some documents referred to Bishop Wielgus by the code names Grey, Adam and Adam Wysocki. They said he received training and was rewarded for his collaboration with a grant to study in Munich.  Later Friday, Bishop Wielgus issued another statement, which was broadcast by Vatican Radio's Polish service, in which he said he had collaborated so that he could travel abroad for his academic research.  ''I'm not trying to justify anything, I know that I shouldn't have had any relations with the Communist regime's secret services,'' he said. ''At the time I thought I had to continue my important scientific research and acquire sound training for the good of the church.''  The Vatican has continued to support the embattled prelate.  ''The Holy See, in deciding the nomination of the new archbishop of Warsaw, took into consideration all the circumstances of his life, including those regarding his past,'' the Vatican said in a statement on Friday, repeating the position it has taken for the past month.  The statement said Benedict ''has every confidence in Bishop Stanislaw Wielgus and in full conscience entrusted him the mission of pastor of the archdiocese of Warsaw.''",

            "fulltext": "The Roman Catholic Church in Poland was in turmoil on Monday as a second prelate stepped down because of his Communist-era secret police ties, after Sunday's resignation of this city's archbishop over similar allegations.  Questions spread about just how broad and deep a stain secret-police collaboration has left on a church long regarded as a beacon of faith and freedom during the Communist era. Many people also have asked how or why the Vatican could have invited the storm by appointing a man to such a sensitive post despite knowing that he had a clouded past.  ''The people responsible for the procedure of appointing such candidates applied the traditional way of doing it, which means it was without an investigation and was based on their confidence in the truthfulness of the candidate,'' said the Rev. Dariusz Kowalczyk, head of the Jesuits in Warsaw.  In short, church officials from Warsaw to Rome suggested that the archbishop, Stanislaw Wielgus, alone was to blame.  But many people here worry that a mishandling of the affair could permanently damage the last major bastion of Roman Catholic faithful in Europe at a time when the Polish church is already facing the secularizing trend that has emptied churches in Italy, France and Spain.  While cases of Communist collaboration by Polish clergy members have made headlines before, the latest threatens to set off what some worry could be a pernicious cycle of exposures that could erode the church's image.  Just a day after Archbishop Wielgus resigned after admitting that he had collaborated with the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, the Rev. Janusz Bielanski resigned as rector of Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, the burial site of Polish kings and queens. Father Bielanski cited ''repeated allegations about his cooperation with the secret services'' in his resignation.  The archbishop's resignation has divided the church between those, like Cardinal Jozef Glemp, who were angered that public pressure had scuttled the appointment and the 60 percent who wanted him to step down, according to a recent survey.  The cardinal, who held the archbishop's post before the appointment of Bishop Wielgus and was reappointed to the job temporarily after the resignation, publicly defended Bishop Wielgus on Sunday.  Poland's conservative Dziennik daily newspaper called Cardinal Glemp's defense a ''huge mistake,'' writing that ''he didn't even mention that the archbishop lied to the last minute. That he lied to the pope, bishops and faithful.''  The turmoil in Poland reverberated back to the Vatican, amid deepening questions of why officials gave such strong support to Bishop Wielgus's contentious appointment in a place of such importance to the Catholic Church.  One of Pope Benedict XVI's greatest concerns is the rapidly declining church attendance around Europe. In May, he visited Poland to urge the nation not to uproot itself from the church as it modernized in other ways. ''Stand firm in your faith!'' he exclaimed.  Any deep erosion of faith in Poland as a result of disclosures that priests collaborated with the Communists would be troubling for a pope elected to re-evangelize Europe as a whole.  George Weigel, a Catholic writer who has taught in Poland for the last 15 years, said he did not believe that the Wielgus case alone could provoke such wide distrust.  ''The danger is for the future,'' he said. ''If you don't acknowledge that there were problems with a very small minority of people, and that some of them included the clergy, then you run the risk of seeming to be avoiding the truth.''  Mr. Weigel said the Polish church should appoint its own commission to review the secret-police files -- and to explain publicly what it finds.  The case has also raised questions among church experts about Benedict's papacy. While some experts like Mr. Weigel maintain that the case says more about the difficulties inside Poland, others drew similarities with the uproar Benedict caused after he delivered a speech in September that seemed to equate Islam with violence.  In both cases, they say, a pope with an impeccable grasp of theology and doctrine seemed tone-deaf to politics. They say they believe that either he has been ill served by his advisers or, as has been reported often in the Italian news media, makes many important decisions alone.  ''I think this hurts the pope's credibility, and I think we will see more of this if he continues to try to do it alone,'' said Robert Mickens, a Vatican expert for The Tablet, a liberal British Catholic magazine.  In a letter to Polish bishops on Saturday, Bishop Wielgus wrote that soon after his nomination to the archbishop's post he had informed the pope and other Vatican officials of ''being entangled in contacts with the secret services of past times.''  The Vatican could have asked the bishop for access to any files related to his entanglement that might have existed in the secret-police archives. It is not clear whether the Vatican did so before it appointed him to the job. Such files did exist and were eventually leaked to the Polish news media, leading to the archbishop's resignation.  Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the Vatican official responsible for appointing bishops, said that in this case, church officials simply did not know the full story of Bishop Wielgus's past.  Joaqu\u00edn Navarro-Valls, until earlier this year the Vatican's chief spokesman, wrote an article in the Italian daily La Repubblica on Monday outlining the difficulties imposed by the Communists, which often forced priests and others to become compromised.  ''Wielgus would never have been allowed to study abroad if he had not agreed to the compromise offered him by the regime,'' he wrote. ''And this situation was common for many of his compatriots, whether priests or not.''  An exception, he said, was Karol Wojtyla, the Polish priest and cardinal who became Pope John Paul II in 1978. While Father Wojtyla was permitted to study in Rome in the late 1940s and also attended the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s, Dr. Navarro-Valls said in an interview that it was ''absolutely impossible'' that he was compromised, though he was regularly approached by the police.  But in his article, he said John Paul urged understanding of the difficulties the Communists posed to Poles. ''One must learn and forgive,'' he quoted the pope as saying.",

            "fulltext": "The newly appointed archbishop of Warsaw, Stanislaw Wielgus, abruptly resigned on Sunday at a Mass meant to celebrate his new position after having admitted two days earlier that he had worked with the Polish Communist-era secret police.  There is no direct evidence that Bishop Wielgus spied on any of his fellow clergy members. But the revelation and the resignation have shaken one of Europe's largest concentrations of Catholics and refocused scrutiny on collaboration with the Communist government by some of the clergy in Poland even as the church was supporting dissidents trying to free themselves from that political system.  Moments before he was to symbolically ascend to his new place in the church hierarchy by taking his seat on the archbishop's throne at St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw, Bishop Wielgus read from a letter he had sent Pope Benedict XVI earlier in the day offering his resignation ''after reflecting deeply and assessing my personal situation.''  A roar of shock arose from the crowd inside the cathedral and stunned many people watching the proceedings live on television. The Vatican had announced the resignation a half hour earlier, though few had heard the news.  ''Stay with us, we want you here!'' people in the church shouted as a clearly troubled Bishop Wielgus removed his glasses and sat down beside Warsaw's departing archbishop, Cardinal Jozef Glemp.  The Vatican reappointed Cardinal Glemp to the position until a new archbishop could be found, and he took the throne instead. But Cardinal Glemp, who supported Bishop Wielgus's promotion, was also clearly troubled by the sudden turn of events and defended him later in his homily.  The Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, who was sitting at the front of the congregation, applauded Bishop Wielgus's resignation then stopped, apparently realizing that the commotion from the crowd was overwhelmingly against it. Mr. Kaczynski has led the country's renewed efforts to expose former Communist secret police agents and their informants.  Outside the cathedral, scuffles erupted between supporters and detractors of the bishop among the hundreds of Catholics gathered beneath umbrellas in the rain. Some of his supporters shouted that ''Jews'' were trying to destroy the church. Anti-Semitism, long present in Poland, is a particular problem within some conservative branches of the Polish Catholic church.  The resignation of an archbishop, or even a bishop, so soon after an appointment is rare, if not unprecedented, and raises questions about how he could have been given the job with such serious doubts surrounding his past.  Bishop Wielgus, 67, had tried to minimize reports of his collaboration, which surfaced two weeks after the pope appointed him to the post on Dec. 6. He insisted that his contacts with the country's feared Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, were benign and routine.  Bishop Wielgus may have believed that there were no longer documents linking him to the secret police. Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, who served as chief of secret services and minister of internal affairs during the Communist years, told the Polish clergy in the early 1990s that all files related to them had been destroyed, according to Adrzej Jonas, editor of the Warsaw Voice, a weekly newsmagazine. But microfilm of some of the documents on Bishop Wielgus survived. They do not include any reports written by the bishop, though in one document a secret police agent praised him for providing information on fellow priests while teaching at the Catholic University of Lublin. He admitted deeper involvement Friday after the Polish news media published the documents, though he maintained that he did not spy on anyone or hurt anyone. Two groups of experts, one from the church, said the documents proved his willingness to work for the secret police even though they did not prove what he did.  That judgment set in motion negotiations with the Vatican that ended with his resignation. In its statement, the Vatican said the charges surrounding Bishop Wielgus had ''gravely compromised his authority.''  Allegations that the secret service archives contained incriminating documents concerning Bishop Wielgus first appeared in the Polish media in the middle of 2006, shortly after he was mentioned as a potential successor to Cardinal Glemp. The documents that led to his resignation had been located by Dec. 20, when the Polish news media began reporting their contents.  Still, the Vatican was sufficiently confident of Bishop Wielgus's innocence to allow him to take the canonical vows for the post Friday. It even reissued a statement saying that it had taken into account ''all the circumstances of his life, including those regarding his past,'' and that Pope Benedict had ''every confidence'' in him.  Many people believe that the pope changed his mind only after personally reviewing the documents in question or at the urging of Polish government officials.  ''Definitely there must have been somebody very high up, maybe the president, who was in touch with the Vatican,'' said Zbigniew Lewicki, a professor at the University of Warsaw. ''Otherwise, why would he have changed his mind without anything new surfacing.''  It is the second major miscalculation by Pope Benedict since he was chosen as pontiff in April 2005. In September, he caused an uproar among Muslims with a speech he gave in Germany that seemed to equate Islam with violence.  Any cooperation between the Polish clergy and the secret police is troubling to Poles because the church under the Polish-born pope, John Paul II, was considered a beacon of hope and encouragement to people opposing the Communists.  That the head of the Warsaw archdiocese could be a former Communist collaborator would have been a cruel twist for many people here who remember the murder of Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, one of the first priests from the influential archdiocese to support the pro-democracy Solidarity movement. He was beaten to death by police agents in 1984. They dumped his body in a reservoir.  Poland screened thousands of people for past Communist collaboration in the early 1990s, but the process lost momentum until President Kaczynski revived it last year. He has argued that the country's 1989 transition left much of the Communist apparatus in place, fueling corruption and distorting democracy. He says society cannot move forward without breaking with that past.  But many people argue that the secret police files are in many cases too incomplete or unreliable for conclusive judgments and are too easily manipulated for political ends.  It was not clear what Bishop Wielgus would do in the wake of the resignation. The bishop said his contact with the secret police started when he applied to study in what was then West Germany.  He spent 1973-75 at the University of Munich and went there again in 1978 when Pope Benedict, then Joseph Ratzinger, was teaching there. He spent the rest of his career teaching philosophy at the Catholic University of Lublin, where he served three terms as rector. Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of Plock, north of Warsaw, in 1999 and he served in that post until being appointed archbishop of Warsaw.  The drama over Bishop Wielgus was, in part, a battle between opposing forces in the Polish church -- mirrored in societies across the post-Soviet bloc -- between those willing to forgive and forget and those who insist that past Communist collaborators be exposed and be excluded from positions of authority.  ''Today a judgment was passed on Bishop Wielgus,'' said Cardinal Glemp in a homily defending the prelate that was interrupted repeatedly by applause. ''But what kind of judgment was it, based on shreds of paper photocopied three times over? We do not want such judgments.''  Had the church managed to keep Bishop Wielgus in his new job, the program to purge former collaborators would have been severely weakened, Mr. Jonas of the Warsaw Voice said.  ''It wouldn't be possible to accuse somebody or blame somebody for being a spy or former member of the secret service if the archbishop of Warsaw was himself one,'' he said.",

            "fulltext": "A week after the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York released its final list of 21 parishes to be closed as part of a broad reorganization, some parishioners are digging in for a battle, enlisting help from parishioners in the Boston Archdiocese who successfully resisted some church closings there with round-the-clock sit-ins.  Parishioners from Our Lady Queen of Angels in East Harlem plan to march today in their neighborhood to protest the archdiocese's decision to shutter their parish. They have also invited Peter Borr\u00e9, co-chairman of a group in the Boston Archdiocese called the Council of Parishes that fought church closings, to speak to them and offer advice on how to take on church authorities.  The decision to consult with Mr. Borr\u00e9, 68, who has also been in touch this week with parishioners at Mary Help of Christians in the East Village, which is also on the closing list, could portend a protracted struggle ahead for archdiocesan officials in New York.  ''We're not out to tell anybody what to do,'' Mr. Borr\u00e9 said. ''That's up to the parishioners. But we'll share willingly all of our experiences.''  In Boston, Roman Catholic officials have sought to close 83 parishes since 2004, but parishioners managed to win at least partial reprieves for about two dozen churches through a combination of appeals to the Vatican, lawsuits, sit-ins and news media attention, Mr. Borr\u00e9 said.  In about half the cases, the victories are for now only temporary, he added, with authorities merely holding off on a promised closing, or delaying issuing a final date for the ''suppression'' of the parish.  But in the other cases, he said, archdiocesan officials actually reversed their decision to close the parish, or at least allowed parishioners to keep their church building as a worship site, or established for them smaller chapels attached to another parish.  Parishioners are still conducting sit-ins in five churches, in some cases occupying the buildings 24 hours a day for 27 straight months, holding services week in and week out without a priest, even though the churches are considered closed by church authorities.  The efforts of Mr. Borr\u00e9's organization have been extensively chronicled in The Boston Globe. Mr. Borr\u00e9, a Harvard graduate who spent his career working on energy issues in government and the private sector, is in many ways an unlikely crusader against the Roman Catholic hierarchy. He got involved in fighting church authorities when his parish in Charlestown, Mass., was scheduled to close. He and other parishioners won a partial reprieve when the archdiocese agreed not to close their church completely but allowed them to keep their building as a worship site connected to another parish.  A member of Mary Help of Christians contacted Mr. Borr\u00e9 for advice this week, but church members have not yet decided their next move. They will be convening tomorrow to discuss strategy, said another longtime member, Marlena Palacios. They are contemplating, among other possibilities, a protest in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral, she said.  But an important question is how many parishioners feel strongly enough to devote themselves to the effort.  ''A lot of people want to fight,'' Ms. Palacios said. ''A lot of people want to keep it open, but that doesn't mean they're going to get involved.''  Parishioners at Our Lady Queen of Angels began mobilizing almost immediately after the announcement last week.  Established in 1886, the parish initially served German immigrants. Today, it caters to a mixture of Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Dominicans and black congregants. Attendance at the parish has dwindled to about 400 at Sunday services.  For members of the mostly immigrant congregation, said Carmen Villegas, 52, a longtime parishioner, the church is a home away from home.  ''There's only a few places we feel at home, and at Queen of Angels, we feel at home,'' she said. ''They're taking our home from us.''  Ms. Villegas said she had been in touch over the past year with Francis Piderit, a New York-area leader of Voice of the Faithful, a national organization that was formed in the aftermath of the clergy sexual abuse scandal to press for more accountability and transparency from Roman Catholic leaders.  Voice of the Faithful organized a meeting in the spring for parishes on the initial New York Archdiocesan list to discuss their options.  Soon after last week's announcement, Mr. Piderit contacted Ms. Villegas to offer his condolences, told her about Mr. Borr\u00e9's successful efforts in Boston and asked if she might want to talk with him. She immediately agreed, she said.  ''They have done a great job in Boston,'' Ms. Villegas said. ''They have stopped the process in some of the churches.''  The next day, Mr. Borr\u00e9 offered to fly down to meet with Ms. Villegas and others from the parish.  Last Sunday, Ms. Villegas stood at the altar after the Spanish-language Mass and told her fellow parishioners about Mr. Borr\u00e9 and called on them to form a prayer circle for the church outside after service. ''I got up in the pulpit and said, 'We are resisting this decision,''' Ms. Villegas said. ''If you want to join me, I'll be outside.''  About 150 people gathered and sang ''We Shall Overcome,'' she said. About 50 more gathered after the English-language Mass.  Ms. Villegas, who has been a member of the parish since 1974, said she was unsure if the church had enough people to hold a round-the-clock sit-in, something Mr. Borr\u00e9 said required about two dozen committed members.  Gloria Lopez, 61, said she was prepared do whatever was necessary to keep her church open.  ''We're not going to budge from the church,'' she said. ''They won't be able to get us out.''  Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said that the churches on the closing list already had their chance to make their case. ''We believe we have acted properly, carefully, consulting at every step along the way. The decisions have been made, and there is no intention to go back on them.''",

            "fulltext": "When the Rev. Mark Beckwith becomes the 10th bishop to lead the Episcopal Diocese of Newark on Saturday, parts of the service will be read in English, Spanish, French, Korean and Malayalam, an Indian language, to reflect the tongues spoken by the diocese's 27,600 parishioners.  Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark will read from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ''Letter From Birmingham Jail.'' There will be gospel music, and a Native American flute. Katharine Jefferts Schori, the first woman to serve as presiding bishop of the national Episcopal Church, will give the sermon.  Among those participating in the traditional laying on of hands will be a former Newark bishop, John Shelby Spong, who found himself at the center of controversy when he ordained an openly gay man to the priesthood in 1989.  In an interview last week, Mr. Beckwith invoked Aquinas, saying: ''Diversity is the perfection of the universe, and this diocese approaches that. I like to think I'm pretty fierce in honoring diversity and the giftedness of everyone.''  The post is a homecoming of sorts for Mr. Beckwith, 55, who served 11 years in Episcopal parishes in Morristown and Hackensack before leaving in 1993 for All Saints Church in Worcester, Mass.  The Newark diocese, which includes 113 northern New Jersey parishes, created a stir in the fall when nominees for bishop included a gay priest, who finished fifth in the voting.  The Anglican Communion, the worldwide body that includes the Episcopal Church, is deeply divided over the issue of gay bishops and the blessing of gay unions; the communion's nominal leader, the archbishop of Canterbury, suggested a plan in June in which the Episcopal Church could choose to renounce gay bishops and the blessings of same-sex unions or risk losing full membership in the communion.  The Rev. Canon V. Gene Robinson, who is gay, was elected bishop of New Hampshire in 2003.  In replacing Bishop John P. Croneberger, who is retiring, the Newark search committee said it was looking for someone who could help its congregations grow, since its membership has decreased by almost half since 1970. Mr. Beckwith's church in Worcester grew to 900 members from about 700 in his years there.  ''The average Episcopalian invites someone else to church every 26 years,'' Mr. Beckwith lamented as he settled into his corner office at the Episcopal House on Mulberry Street, a few blocks from the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, where the Saturday ceremony will be held. ''We're quick to tell people about a movie or a restaurant we've enjoyed, but we're very hesitant in this part of the country to tell others where our souls get fed.''  Newcomers to Episcopal churches are often confused, he said, by crossword puzzle words used on Sundays like chancel, narthex and undercroft; his former congregation provided a glossary for unfamiliar terms or avoided them. Visitors also often worry during the service that they are standing when they should be sitting or sitting when they should be standing, Mr. Beckwith said, adding, ''It's a wonderful dance, and each congregation has its own dance.''  In his years in New Jersey, Mr. Beckwith was known for social service work: he was a co-founder of a homeless shelter in Morristown, and his church in Hackensack held a monthly healing service for people with AIDS in the early days of the epidemic. In Worcester, his parishioners held vigils after drive-by shootings.  ''I've always been deeply enriched by walking the streets and talking to people,'' he said.  The Rev. Geoffrey Curtiss, the rector of All Saints parish in Hoboken, has worked with Mr. Beckwith for 20 years on developing urban ministries.  ''I think he's going to be able to address many of the issues our diocese is struggling with,'' Mr. Curtiss said. ''I think Mark will bring a vision to the diocese that will help us look at fighting for the life of a congregation,'' by encouraging strong leadership and helping even small churches be strong participants in their communities.  The Rev. Sandye Wilson, rector of the Church of St. Andrew and Holy Communion in South Orange, called Mr. Beckwith ''a man of passion and compassion.''  ''My hope and dream is that he will bring that same passion and fervor for justice and fairness and peace to his work,'' she said, ''and that passion will be contagious, and he will ignite new fervor in our diocese for excited worship that transforms us and takes us into the world to transform the world.''  Ms. Wilson added, ''He takes the work we're given to do seriously, and he doesn't take himself seriously at all.''",

            "fulltext": "The Misunderstood Jew  The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus  By Amy-Jill Levine  250 pages. HarperSanFrancisco. $24.95.  As a child Amy-Jill Levine insisted on attending catechism class at a Catholic church. She faithfully administered Holy Communion to her Barbie doll. This, despite being, then as now, an observant Jew. A professor of New Testament studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School, Ms. Levine has spent a lifetime exploring the profound connections and equally profound divisions between Christianity and Judaism -- and, perhaps more important, between Christians and Jews.  The premise of ''The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus'' is simple: Jews and Christians need to understand one another. The implicit corollary: Despite years of trying, and to their mutual harm, they do not.  In a book intended for Jews and Christians alike (but mostly addressed to Christians) Ms. Levine offers both critique and corrective on topics as seemingly disparate as the Jewish content of the Lord's Prayer and Christian responses to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But that is Ms. Levine's point: to show how frequently and disastrously inaccurate beliefs about Jesus and early Judaism produce distorted relationships in the present.  Her first chapters, devoted to the Jewish Jesus and the New Testament, are the least satisfying. In the interests of educating her reader about Judaism in both the first century and the 21st, she moves somewhat erratically between the two eras.  A discussion of Jesus' views on the Sabbath begins with a modern Jewish view of the Sabbath before considering the roots of this view in the Torah, and she discusses how the Christian celebration of Sabbath on Sunday rather than Saturday changes its symbolic import, before returning to Jesus and his first-century context. The information is valuable but might be more edifying, especially for the nonspecialists who form the book's primary audience, if the shifting time frame were less distracting.  Ms. Levine's reconstructions of first-century Judaism are corrective in some places but elsewhere simply repeat unhelpful truisms. For example, she uncritically takes rabbinic writings as representing the ''majority'' view among first-century Jews, despite growing scholarly rejection of this stance. Similarly, Paul's belief that Jesus' blood atoned for human sin is described as unprecedented and ''off-putting'' for Jews. Certainly, blood atonement is off-putting for most modern Jews, but in some ancient Jewish contexts it was standard fare, as evidenced by repeated claims in 2 and 4 Maccabees that the blood of Jewish martyrs atoned for the sins of the people.  Ms. Levine's perpetuation of some anachronistic readings, however, confirms her larger point: Our received assumptions about what Jesus (and Paul) meant in their original settings are deeply entrenched, often serving agendas of which we are not even aware. She is on a surer footing when she addresses the question of anti-Judaism within the New Testament. Three extremely painful texts -- 1 Thessalonians 2:14-15, with its claim that the Jews killed Jesus; Matthew 27:25, in which the Jews call for Jesus' blood upon themselves and their children; and John 8:44, in which Jesus labels the Jews ''children of the Devil'' -- suffice to demonstrate that regardless of authorial intent or historical context, the plain meaning of the New Testament is often virulently anti-Jewish.  In such instances historical context becomes irrelevant; the problem will not be solved by more or better scholarship. Rather, the problem can be addressed only by those who read these texts as Scripture: ''Christians must denounce anti-Jewish readings.'' What Ms. Levine finds, however, is that even theologically educated and well-meaning Christians frequently don't denounce such readings, but instead either deny their anti-Jewish content (here the Pontifical Biblical Commission comes in for special criticism) or, often unwittingly, replicate it.  Ms. Levine's documentation of the insouciance with which liberal Christians slander Jews and Judaism is perhaps the book's most important contribution. She cites numerous examples of contemporary scholars, particularly theologians of liberation, who first ''invent a bad Judaism'' and then ''explain how Jesus abrogates this bad system.'' In her most outrageous example, Jesus' crucifixion is said to mark the ''triumph of the patriarchal god of Judaism.''  Many of the works Ms. Levine cites were published by the World Council of Churches, a group committed to overcoming anti-Semitism. How can well-meaning Christians perpetuate such theological abomination? Mostly, argues Ms. Levine, through sloppy scholarship and lazy reading.  Christian seminarians are taught little about Judaism, either ancient or modern (Judaism does not count as a ''different'' tradition in many programs that require study of a non-Christian tradition), and so look to the only ''Jews'' available -- the Israelites of the Old Testament -- for a model of what Jews do and believe. First-century Jews are seen either as figures transplanted from the Old Testament or as practitioners of a ''late Judaism'' that has corrupted Old Testament ideals. Modern Jews, in turn, embody the already-fossilized religion practiced by Jesus' first-century enemies.  Within this limited horizon Jesus can only be defined against the Judaism of his day rather than within it. Hence Ms. Levine's concern ''to see Jesus as a Jew who made sense to other Jews in a Jewish context,'' ultimately allowing him to become ''a bridge,'' spanning the gap between modern Jews and Christians.  Jewish-Christian dialogue, having come into its own in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has seemed less compelling in recent decades. Ms. Levine's chilling tales of casual anti-Judaism among scholars who should know better rekindles the urgency of the task. She covers a vast canvas and of necessity does so in broad strokes, some more effective than others. But it is a book whose strengths far outweigh its flaws, and whose flaws count only because its subject matters so deeply.

Others envision a gleaming pedestrian walkway, offering spectacular views of the Hudson Valley.  It is that vision that inspires members of Walkway Over the Hudson, a nonprofit group dedicated to building the walkway and reopening the bridge so that strollers and cyclists can experience firsthand what has captivated railroad enthusiasts and history buffs, not to mention politicians and writers, for decades.  Fixing up the bridge -- the first to span the Hudson south of Albany -- is something of an obsession for David Rocco, a retired carpenter from Yorktown and a member of Walkway. Mr. Rocco said the bridge combines three of his favorite things: train tracks that can be converted to public pathways, railroad history and ''the beautiful Hudson River.''  ''It's the trifecta for me,'' he said.  Walkway, which has owned the bridge since 1998, would love to reopen it in the spring of 2009 to coincide with the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's first trip up the river. The challenges are considerable; most glaring is the more than $10 million -- some estimates run as high as $30 million -- needed to build a walkway from the charred remains of a fire that closed the bridge in 1974, as well as pay for other additions, like an elevator.  The bridge, which is parallel to the Mid-Hudson Bridge, was completed in 1888, five years after the Brooklyn Bridge opened. It initially served passengers and freight and was the primary rail route for goods traveling from New England to points west of the Hudson. After the completion of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City in 1917, its role diminished. It was being used strictly for freight when the 1974 fire torched the railroad ties on the Poughkeepsie side, warping the rails. The bridge never carried another train.  Fred Schaeffer, a Poughkeepsie lawyer who is Walkway's president, said the bridge -- an Erector Set-like structure that climbs out of the Hudson like a black skeleton -- deserves better. ''The bridge helped this country grow,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. ''It tied this country together.''  Now, Mr. Schaeffer simply hopes the bridge will tie the Hudson Valley together. Walkway members see it as the centerpiece connecting bike paths and green space, with shops and restaurants dotting the surrounding areas.  Whether it is all a pipe dream should become clearer in coming months, when an engineering firm hired by Walkway completes a feasibility study. In November, as part of the study, inspectors in wetsuits found the bridge's underwater piers to be sound, but the structure is in dire need of a paint job, and building a walkway some 212 feet above the Hudson will not be done by weekend volunteers.  The group also hopes to build an elevator to the walkway in Poughkeepsie's Waryas Park, near the city's Metro-North station, a children's museum and a cluster of restaurants.  An $874,000 grant from the federal government in 2005 was a big step, as was $155,000 from the governor's office. The City of Poughkeepsie also ripped up a $550,000 tax lien that Walkway had inherited from the bridge's previous owner. Mayor Nancy Cozean said she saw the project as a metaphor for older cities looking to reinvent themselves.  Still, Mr. Rocco concedes that the group is far from its financial goal. He hopes to make up the difference with a mix of city, county and state funds, along with private donations. The local congressman, Maurice Hinchey, said he was doing everything he could to make sure the project was financed. ''I'm absolutely certain this is going to go,'' he said.  Something about the bridge and the views of the Hudson it provides seem to inspire optimism. ''Standing atop that deserted railbed was among the most humbling experiences I've ever had,'' said Robert Klara, a writer and railroad historian who walked over the bridge in the early '90s. ''Views notwithstanding, there's a kind of industrial lyricism to the bridge's trusses, rivets and crossbars. Even as a ruin, it's a thing of great beauty.''  Local residents say anything meant to spur tourism has their support. Enjoying an unseasonably warm January day in Waryas Park, in the shadow of the bridge, William Durling said he was intrigued by the project.  ''It'd be excellent for the city to rejuvenate the bridge,'' he said.  LANDMARKS",

But M\u00f6venpick's latest hotel, a 408-room high-rise that opened in September on Amsterdam's busy harbor, is a cool surprise. Designed by the Dutch firm Claus en Kaan, the hotel has a 20-story exterior striped in alternating bands of glass, white concrete and green granite -- not unlike an enormous Popsicle.  THE LOCATION  Despite its name, the hotel is not quite in the Amsterdam city center. Situated on the water's edge, between the new Muziekgebouw concert hall and the Passenger Terminal buildings, it is about a 10-minute walk from rail service at Central Station. (It offers an hourly shuttle to the station during the day.)  THE CROWD  Business travelers and tourists in jeans and T-shirts. During a recent check in, one could overhear American, British and African accents. It's also a smoke-free hotel (a new concept for this city), so expect a small crowd to huddle outdoors, in front of the lobby bar.  THE ROOMS  Insist on a room on the 10th floor or higher for the most striking views of the active harbor, dotted with ferries, cruise ships, small boats and cranes. The windows in my standard double took up nearly half the wall, which not only made the average-size room feel spacious, but compensated for the lack of a flat-screen TV. When your eyes finally focus on the contemporary interior, you'll notice a comfortable bed, a navy blue couch under the window and an electric kettle for coffee or tea. The d\u00e9cor picks up on the facade's striped motif: gray wall-to-wall carpeting, lined beige curtains and thinly striped ivory-and-brown nightstands.  THE BATHROOMS  Small but efficient, with spotless white-tile surfaces and bright halogen lighting. The shower stall was tiny, but offered good pressure and instant hot water. The towels were small, but fluffy and bleach white. The Bogner bath products included shower gel and shampoo.  AMENITIES  Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel, and two computers are available in the lobby. A small but well-equipped gym and spa are on the mezzanine level. A stylish Asian-themed restaurant, Silk Road, has funky bamboo wallpaper, communal wooden tables and an eclectic menu of Indian, Indonesian and Thai dishes, along with other international cuisine. At 21 euros a person ($27 at $1.33 to the euro), breakfast is not cheap, but it offers a generous buffet of pastries, fruits, cereals, cheeses, meats and an omelet bar.  ROOM SERVICE  Fast and professional. A cappuccino was delivered piping hot less than 10 minutes after the order was placed. It was served in a large mug and cost less than a latte at Starbucks, even after the tip. The 24-hour menu includes a good selection of comfort foods like burgers, pasta and, of course, M\u00f6venpick ice cream.  BOTTOM LINE  This hotel offers good value a short trek from Amsterdam's center. Those who want old European charm along the city's historic canals should look elsewhere (and be prepared to spend at least 200 euros). Otherwise the dramatic harbor views, moderate rates and modern amenities make up for the extra walking and cab fares.  Standard rooms start at 145 euros a night on weekends and 175 euros on weekdays, or $188.60 and $227.60; for junior suites add a 120-euro supplement, or $156; and for the enormous Ambassador suite, add 220 euros, or $286, to the rate.

            "fulltext": "BEYOND the seaside curtain of megahotels, theme restaurants and jam-packed beaches that have made Canc\u00fan, Mexico, a spring break mecca, there lies an idyllic, veiled city. It is a Canc\u00fan apart, which offers tranquil sunsets and shaded parks for post-college beachgoers who have outgrown cavernous nightclubs and wet T-shirt contests. This is a Canc\u00fan, where brass bands parade through the pubic square, waves crash against vacant shorelines and the friendly women at corner food stands will teach you how to make a perfect quesadilla.  Friday  5 p.m.  1. Bienvenidos, Margarita  This is Canc\u00fan, so grab a drink. For views of a Caribbean sunset, tiny islands and kayakers skimming across glassy waters, go to La Dolce Vita (Boulevard Kukulcan, kilometer 14.6; 52-998 885-0161; www.cancunitalianrestaurant.com), an Italian restaurant situated along Laguna Nichupt\u00e9, the broad lagoon that separates mainland Canc\u00fan from the thin peninsula of the Hotel Zone. Sit outdoors on a wind-swept terrace and order a margarita (60 pesos, or about $5.40 at 11.17 pesos to the dollar) made with fresh lime juice as the sun dips below the blue waters.  7 p.m.  2. Death Wears a Horseshoe  Every corner store hawks cheesy T-shirts and fake Mayan art, but when you need a love potion or baggie of frozen tears, there's only Tienda La Esfinge, a tiny boutique devoted to black magic and Christian paraphernalia (Avenida Xel-Ha No. 28, in Market 28; 52-998 884-5724). Inside this lime-green storefront, votives burn on a small altar and shelves brim with crystals, potions and religious statues. Especially striking is Santa Muerte, a skeletal figure of death festooned with horseshoes and other charms. He comes in sizes small, medium, large and 7-Foot Nightmare. Karen Altamirano, one of the owners, does tarot readings, which cost up to 300 pesos.  8 p.m.  3. Yucat\u00e1n Tapas, Not Tacos  It's not all onion rings and day-glo frozen drinks in this resort town. A string of classy restaurants has opened around the Parque las Palapas, Canc\u00fan's charming downtown park, that serve everything from tapas and crepes, to upscale Mexican cuisine. Restaurante Labn\u00e1 on the park's northwestern corner (Calle Margaritas 29; 52-998 892-3056; www.labna.com), serves dauntingly large portions of classic Yucat\u00e1n fare. Start out with a tangy bowl of lime soup (48 pesos) and take a culinary tour of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula with the Paseo por el Yucat\u00e1n (125 pesos), a sampler of traditional dishes from the region, including roast pork with sour orange juice, fried pumpkin, tamales and tortillas filled with egg.  10 p.m.  4. Music in the Square  After dinner, stroll around Parque las Palapas and watch local artists hang paintings, kids play pickup soccer and women sell hot fried bananas from pushcarts. This is downtown Canc\u00fan's softly beating heart. Grab a concrete park bench and a cup of warm atol, a sweet corn beverage (about 10 pesos), while you people-watch or catch one of the free concerts, dances or festivals that occur most weekends. Small brass bands are likely to march by as they circle the park on their way to the center stage. For more refined entertainment, check out the friendly clubs and cafes that line the plaza. Try El Rinc\u00f3n del Vino (Calle Alcatraces 29) for Mexican guitar; Terraza Chacmool (Calle Gladiolas 18; 52-998 892-1462) for Latino funk,; and Roots (Calle Tuilpanes 26; 52-998-884 2437) for top-notch Canc\u00fan jazz.  Saturday  8 a.m.  5. Island, Ho!  Spend the day on Isla Mujeres, a skinny little island long on history and charm. It was on this island that Mayans worshipped the fertility goddess Ixchel, pirates sought refuge, and wayward travelers found paradise and opened coffee shops. To get to the island from downtown Canc\u00fan, catch a taxi (about 25 pesos) or a bus marked Puerto Ju\u00e1rez to the Gran Puerto Canc\u00fan ferry terminal (www.granpuerto.com.mx). From there, it's a 15-minute boat ride (70 pesos roundtrip) through jade-colored waters. Ferries run from 6:30 a.m. to midnight, every hour or half hour.  10 a.m.  6. Getting to Know Parrot Fish  The three best things to do on Isla Mujeres, in no particular order, are: Be near the water, on the water, or in the water. To explore the sky-clear waters, go snorkeling on a tour led by anglers from the local fisherman's cooperative, Cooperativa Isla Mujeres (52-998 877-0283), just steps from the main ferry dock. For 250 pesos, you can spend five hours swimming among sneering barracudas and phosphorescent parrot fish. Schools of sunfish glint and shimmer like ancient coins, and most fishermen will allow you to dive down to explore hurricane-felled ships, now moldering on the sea floor. Another 50 pesos buys you a lunch of grilled fish, salad and rice, prepared on the beach by your guides. Equipment is included in the price, so just simply show up and go.  5 p.m.  7. Sun Spots  Now comes a tough decision: picking a spot of beach to watch the sun set. The island's best beaches are concentrated along its northern tip, in Playa Norte. They draw an easygoing mix of tourist families, young adults playing volleyball and the island's middle-class residents. Drink shacks and thatch-roofed restaurants abound. Most offer happy-hour specials that begin at 4 p.m. and don't end ''until you're drunk,'' as one waiter put it. That's easy to do considering the prices: two beers are about 25 pesos and two daiquiris go for 40 pesos.  8 p.m.  8. Al Fresco \u00e0 la Isla  After sundown, local restaurants transform the island's Avenida Hidalgo into a gastronomic gallery. Tables spill out onto the pavement, and waiters hold out menus for passersby. There are dozens of options, but one standout is Le Bistro Francais (Avenida Matamoros 29, near Hidalgo), which serves well-priced French food in a bustling Technicolor dining room that draws a mix of yuppies and sunburnt beach bums. Dishes include chicken cordon bleu, onion soup or coq au vin, a house specialty. Entrees cost around 70 to 90 pesos. A squawking green parrot often acts as ma\u00eetre d'.  10 p.m.  9. Sea Breezes and Tequila  Before you head back to downtown Canc\u00fan, swing by La Pe\u00f1a, a chilled-out nightspot in downtown Isla Mujeres (Avenida Guerrero between Morelos and Bravo; www.la-pena.myislamujeres.com) for tequila shooters, billiards and local bands who play pop covers and traditional Mexican tunes. For a mellower nightcap, go upstairs to the rooftop terrace and grab a hammock. It's open late -- the doors don't close until 2 a.m. -- but don't forget that the last ferry departs at midnight.  Sunday  10 a.m.  10. A Jigger of la Cultura  Skeletons dance and devils grin in the tiny but fascinating La Casa del Arte Popular Mexicano, an arts and crafts museum wedged into the Hotel Zone (Boulevard Kukulcan; 52-998 849-4332; www.museoartepopularmexicano.org; 55 pesos). An audio guide (in English, French or Spanish) takes you past drums made of butterfly cocoons, masks of conquistadors and antique tortilla presses. Don't miss the wooden dioramas called retablos or the ceramic \u00e1rboles de la vida (trees of life), an ancient Mexican art form that tells the stories of the Bible, bullfighters and fables through allegorical figurines bunched together like branches and leaves. Best of all, you'll likely have the place to yourself.  12 p.m.  11. Baywatch Canc\u00fan  You didn't come to Canc\u00fan just to look at art, so take a deep breath and dive into Canc\u00fan's famous peninsula of talc-white beaches. The seawall of megahotels might seem impenetrable, but all of Canc\u00fan's beaches are open to the public and free. Simply walk througha hotel lobby. If you've got qualms about traipsing through a hotel other than your own, look for any of the 10 access paths that connect the main road to the beach. Playa Tortugas, at kilometer 6.5 of Boulevard Kukulcan, is a popular spot for spring breakers, kayakers, divers and parasailers. Restaurants and changing areas can be found on either end of the beach. Playa Delfines, at kilometer 18 of Boulevard Kukulcan, offers a more solitary spot to sunbathe. Just mind the treacherous currents.  BASICS  Flights bound for Canc\u00fan pour out of the United States. A four-hour flight from Kennedy Airport in New York costs about $600 on American Airlines. From Canc\u00fan International Airport, the best way downtown is on a comfortable ADO bus. The 45-minute ride costs 35 pesos (about $3.15 at 11.17 pesos to the dollar). Bus information is at www.ticketbus.com.mx and available by calling (800) 950-0287 from the United States.  Staying downtown will likely save you some money over Canc\u00fan's Hotel Zone. Prices below are for double rooms, including breakfast, during the December to April high season.  El Rey del Caribe (Uxmal 24; 998 884-2028; www.reycaribe.com) is an eco-friendly hotel in central Canc\u00fan with a garden and courtyard pool. Rooms have kitchenettes. Rates from around 800 pesos.  Xbalamqu\u00e9 (Yaxchil\u00e1n 31, 998 884 9690; www.xbalamque.com) is a bit closer to the central plaza and a bit more luxurious, with a pool, a sauna, yoga classes, massages and other thrills of a spa. From around 850 pesos.  For a great snapshot of life on Isla Mujeres, pick up the bilingual magazine Atando Cabos, which publishes oral histories and captures the flavor of life on the island.  36 HOURS",

            "fulltext": "Imagine if Ian Schrager opened a youth hostel. Such is the concept behind the Pod Hotel, which is opening on East 51st Street in stages this month, with rooms becoming available as they are completed.  Formerly the Pickwick Arms, a drab Midtown lodging, the Pod Hotel holds 347 rooms barely larger than walk-in closets. A 100-square-foot hotel room for two may be a tough sell, even in New York. But the owners are betting that guests (target age: 18 to 25) will overlook the cramped quarters if they offer high design at a low price. Rates start at $89 a night for a compact single room, above left, made for the traveler who just wants to dive into bed.  ''Our guest is the stylish spendthrift,'' said Richard Born, a principal of BD Hotels, which also owns Manhattan hotels like the Maritime and the Mercer.  The Pod Hotel is the first of its kind to open in the United States, though capsule hotels have operated in Japan for more than two decades. The stripped-down easyHotel opened in London in 2005, and the chain has since spread through Europe and Asia.  Vanessa Guilford, the Pod Hotel's designer, has echoed transportation's efficient use of space. Bunk beds suggest sleeper cars on trains, and in rooms without bathrooms, a symbol above the door turns green when a shared hallway bathroom is vacant -- a detail borrowed from airplanes. Flip-down coat hooks are the same as those found on Amtrak trains.  ''The idea was to keep it all cheap and cheerful,'' Ms. Guilford said, ''and to simplify it as much as possible.'' In the lounge, above right, a mural by James Rizzi sets the tone. The Pod Hotel is at 230 East 51st Street. For reservations, (212) 355-0300.  MICHAEL CANNELL  CURRENTS: HOTELS",

            "fulltext": "POOR Madrid. Stuck in the middle of Spain, the city has long been perceived as the provincial, sleepy sister to Barcelona. Even today, you can see little girls dressed exactly as their mothers were, in 1940s-style dresses and matching topcoats. But that is precisely Madrid's charm. As the city fast-forwards into the 21st century -- with designer hotels that rival any international city's, a sleek new airport terminal designed by Antonio Lamela and Richard Rogers and non-tapas bars that flirt with minimalist d\u00e9cor -- Madrid is still the country's political and cultural capital. It remains, as Ernest Hemingway wrote, ''the most Spanish of all cities.''  Friday  4:30 p.m.  1) Straight Out of Almod\u00f3var  Grab a ca\u00f1a, or small beer, at the Plaza de Chueca, one of the city's best squares for people watching. It's quite a show: tiny old ladies in knee-length wool coats, young Madrile\u00f1os in skin-tight jeans and mullets, and cross-dressing men who look like Amazonian extras in a Pedro Almod\u00f3var film -- all rushing between the 19th-century town houses, skipping nimbly between piles of dog waste and clutching tiny packages. Sierra (Calle Gr\u00e1vina, 11; 34-91-531-0126) is a friendly bar to take in the scene.  6 p.m.  2) Save the Prado  There is more to Madrid's booming art scene than the Prado. For temporary exhibitions of big-name artists like Roy Lichtenstein without the crowds, check out the smaller museums like the Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March (Calle Castell\u00f3, 77; 34-91-435-4240; www.march.es), the Fundaci\u00f3n Caja Madrid (Plaza San Mart\u00edn, 1; 34-91-379-2349; www.fundacioncajamadrid.es) and the larger but often overlooked Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (Paseo del Prado, 8; 34-91-369-0151; www.museothyssen.org).  10 p.m.  3) Dinner Crawl  Tapas are a Madrid institution and are served in nearly every bar for just a few euros apiece, so you can spread your dinner across the city. The most traditional and popular tapas restaurants line Calle Cava Baja, a curving street just south of Plaza Mayor. Start at Casa Lucas (Calle Cava Baja, 30; 34-91-365-0804), a homey spot for a slice of tortilla espa\u00f1ola (potato omelet), then move up the street for seafood pintxos, the intricate Basque version of tapas, at Txakoli (Calle Cava Baja, 26; 34-91-366-4877). Be warned: these places get more crowded as the night wears on. If balancing plates and shouting doesn't sound like fun, head to Txirimiri, a quieter spot in Salamanca (Calle General D\u00edaz Porlier, 91; 34-91-401-4345) for pintxos supplemented by a full Basque menu. For a global twist on tapas, there is a newcomer called Olsen near Plaza Santa Ana (Calle del Prado, 15; 34-91-429-3659) that swaps the Spanish roster for a Scandinavian smorgasbord. Five sandwiches and five shots of vodka to share, for example, are 22 euros, or $28 at $1.29 to the euro. The stark white Belvedere Vodka Lounge downstairs has a D.J. and stays open until 2:30 a.m.  12:30 a.m  4) Night Rider  Madrile\u00f1os believe that night is the most important time of day. To party like a local, head to the multistory tavern El Viajero, or the Traveler (Plaza Cebada, 11; 34-91-366-9064), which draws everyone from women in their 20s in ''Flashdance'' off-the-shoulder sweatshirts to men in business suits. The roof deck offers unobstructed views of the magnificently illuminated Bas\u00edlica de San Francisco el Grande.  2 a.m.  5) La Vida Loca  It's still early in Madrid, so jump over to La Via Lactea, or the Milky Way (Calle Velarde, 18; 34-91-446-7581), an old-school rock 'n' roll bar that is decorated with three decades of concert posters. The bar opened in 1979 at the height of the Movida, the orgiastic explosion of sex and drugs that followed Franco's death. The clientele may have changed since those days, but the vibe is the same.  Saturday  10:30 a.m.  6) Coffee and Boots  Have a cortado -- a shot of espresso topped with milk -- at trendy Caf\u00e9 Diurno (Calle San Marcos, 37; 34-91-522-0009; www.diurno.com), an airy loftlike coffee shop with Wi-Fi, fresh muffins and croissants in the heart of the gay-friendly Chueca neighborhood. Once you're awake, take a shopping break among the area's small boutiques. Check out Caligae (Calle Augusto Figueroa, 18; 34-91-532-0240) for boots and shoes from Spanish designers like Chie Mihara, or \u00d3ptica Toscana (Calle Hortaleza, 70; 34-91-360-5007; www.opticatoscana.com), a perfectly preserved 19th-century shop, for quirky eyeglasses.  Noon  7) Old Buildings, New Art  Downtown Madrid is dotted with historic buildings that allow visitors a peek into the past. The Centro Conde Duque was built in the 18th century as military barracks; today it is a cultural center (Calle Conde Duque, 11, 34-91-588-5834; www.munimadrid.es) with a small but excellent collection of modern art. Classical concerts are held Saturday evenings in the large internal courtyard; in the summer, string quartets are replaced by jazz, folk and world music singers like Erykah Badu and Cesaria Evora.  3:45 p.m.  8) Barefoot Royals  The Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, or Monastery of Barefoot Royals (Plaza de las Descalzas, 34-91-454-8800; www.patrimonionacional.es), is an imposing convent of Franciscan nuns built in the 16th century. The nuns maintain a remarkable collection of 15th- to 19th-century religious art, including works from Titian and Rubens, some depicting rather gruesome crucifixion scenes. Admission, including a tour, is 5 euros.  5:30 p.m.  9) You Better Shop Around  Skip the Madison Avenue luxury brands on Calle Serrano, and head one block east where shops like Bazaar (Calle Claudio Coello, 88; 34-91-426-0585) and Scooter (Callej\u00f3n de Jorge Juan, 12; 34-91-576-4749) carry of-the-moment French designers like Vanessa Bruno and Tara Jarmon. Nearby, Carmen Kaiser (Calle Claudio Coello, 69 bis; 34-91-576-7496) peddles fancy candles by European labels like Diptyque (41 euros). For post-punk streetwear, head to Mercado Fuencarral (Calle Fuencarral, 45; 34-91-521-4152; www.mdf.es), a three-story market filled with tiny boutiques like Sentido (34-91-521-5373), which sells funky printed T-shirts (18 euros).  10:30 p.m.  10) Royal Cuisine  Rub elbows with the Gucci-clad cr\u00e8me of Madrid society at Pan de Lujo (Calle Jorge Juan, 20; 34-91-436-1100; www.pandelujo.es), a restaurant run by the acclaimed chef Alberto Chicote. The clean and bold design is straight out of Elle Decor: a wall of glass opens onto a reflecting pool illuminated by three big light boxes. Indulge in an appetizer of paper-thin eggplant kissed by olive oil and nestled in delicate hummus (10.50 euros), and then tuck into the poached snapper with crisp baby veggies (20 euros). Reservations are mandatory. For a more traditional but no less happening spot, try Casa Lucio (Calle Cava Baja, 35; 34-91-365-8217; www.casalucio.es), a royal family favorite for 30 years. House specialties include huevos estrellados (broken eggs), served over fries (9.60 euros) and solomillo, a sizzling steak served in a scorching hot pan (21 euros). Paulina Rubio, the Mexican pop star, had waiters swooning on a recent visit.  Sunday  10 a.m.  11) Sunday in the Park  For a bit of green relief, get lost in Retiro, a 330-acre park in the city's center. Rent a bike (By Bike, Avenida Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, 35; 34-902-876-483, www.bybike.info; 4 euros an hour) or just take a Sunday stroll alongside baby carriages and street performers by the artificial lake.  11:30 a.m.  12) Free Art  The big-name museums are free on Sundays, so it's your chance to dip into the Prado (Paseo del Prado; 34-91-330-2800; www.museoprado.es) to see masterpieces like Vel\u00e1zquez's ''Meninas'' or Reina Sofia (Calle Santa Isabel, 52; 34-91-774-1000; www.museoreinasofia.es) for a look at Picasso's ''Guernica.''  1 p.m.  13) Turkey in Madrid  Chances are, you lingered a bit at the Prado. Rest your tired feet at Medina Mayrit (Calle Atocha, 14; 34-902-333-334; www.medinamayrit.com), an authentic Turkish hammam in the heart of Madrid. The hushed terra-cotta subterranean rooms have hot, cold and tepid pools, along with a sultry steam sauna. Take a 90-minute dip (23 euros) and throw in an aromatherapy massage (from 35.50 euros). It's a side of Madrid that Hemingway wouldn't recognize, except that everyone lights up a cigarette as they leave. This is still Spain, after all.  THE BASICS  Continental Airlines flies to Madrid from Newark Airport; Iberia and American fly from Kennedy Airport. A Web search found round-trip fares starting around $500 in February. A taxi from Barajas airport to the city center takes 30 to 45 minutes, and costs about 20 euros, or $25.50 at $1.29 to the euro. The city's Metro (Line 8) takes about 30 minutes and costs 1 euro (www.metromadrid.es).  A number of boutique hotels have opened in downtown Madrid in recent years. Hotel de las Letras (Calle Gran Via, 11; 34-91-523-7980; www.hoteldelasletras.com) is a stylish hotel in a 19th-century town house between Chueca and Puerta del Sol. Rooms start at 140 euros.  AC Palacio del Retiro (Calle Alfonso XII, 14; 34-91-523-7460; www.ac-hotels.com) offers sleek design that appeals to tourists and business travelers alike. Housed in a well-preserved 20th-century mansion, many of the 50 rooms offer views of Retiro Park. Rooms start at 268 euros.  Laura (Traves\u00eda de Trujillos, 3; 34-91-701-1670; www.room-matehotels.com) offers futuristic design at a comfortable price, around the corner from the Monasterio de Descalzas Reales convent.

            "fulltext": "THE BASICS  There are not many hotels in Manhattan with reasonably priced rooms, and perhaps fewer still with an interesting back story. The 120-room Hotel 17 has both. Woody Allen used the different-as-snowflakes rooms, with their throwback feel, as the setting for his film ''Manhattan Murder Mystery.'' A pre-fame Madonna lived in this building, as did the singer Jon Secada. Today the reigning diva is Amanda Lepore, a blond knockout of somewhat hazy gender who is a staple of the downtown New York club scene. It's a cozy hotel, even a little cramped, with slender hallways and a shoebox of a lobby that urges visitors out into the city.  THE LOCATION  The hotel, on the Lower East Side, is centrally positioned to get to the East Village (three blocks away), Union Square (three blocks) and Gramercy Park (four blocks). It's also just a few blocks from the major Union Square-14th Street subway station, where multiple lines stop.  THE ROOMS  It's easy to see why the rooms of Hotel 17 have been popular photo shoot locations for magazines like Vogue. My corner room on the eighth floor had adjacent walls with different wallpapers, neither of which quite matched the bedspread. Red blinds. Blue carpet. The dark furniture had the heavy look of an older era, and the molding was lacquered so heavily it seemed encased in amber. Everything combined to give a pleasantly noir-ish feel. Despite a renovation completed in 2005 that tried to update the look while keeping the place's flavor -- carpeting in the hallways, modern phones in the rooms -- some shabbiness here can't pass for shabby-chic: wallpaper was peeling in one spot; the carpet had a ripple. And yet I've stayed in rooms that cost twice as much that weren't so clean. Moreover, the comfortable, unpretentious mattress did its job and delivered the sleep I'd hoped for.  THE BATHROOMS  The hotel is predominantly shared-bath -- anywhere from two to four rooms a floor share a toilet/shower/tub. This potentially unpleasant arrangement is rescued by two happy facts: the tiled bathrooms were all completely renovated in bright tiles by late 2005, and they're kept immaculate by a crew around the clock. (Now if only those bath towels were more generous, in case you forget the hotel-supplied Breck shampoo across the hall.) Most rooms have also have their own sink and hair dryer.  THE CROWD  About 30 full-time tenants like Ms. Lepore live at Hotel 17, which is also partly an apartment building. ''Most of them are nice,'' the general manager said. I never encountered any celebrity tenants in the small lobby during my stay, but I did see a parade of Europeans, and some British tourists in their late 20s who marched to their rooms or headed out to experience Gotham. Why so many? Simply the good rates, and perhaps also a cultural ease with the notion of sharing a W.C. with strangers.  AMENITIES  This is an old-school, tourist-class hotel. No business center. No fitness center. No day spa. But as the manager said helpfully, ''We have an ice machine on the first floor.''  ROOM SERVICE  No restaurant or room service.  THE BOTTOM LINE  The motto over the door could be: ''You don't come to New York City to stay in your hotel room.'' A clean, safe, offbeat place to crash for a night or two without wiping out your I.R.A. -- but not the place for a snuggly anniversary weekend with your sweetie.

CHRISTOPHER SOLOMON  CHECK IN /CHECK OUT  Correction:  January 14, 2007, Sunday  The Check In/Check Out column last Sunday about Hotel 17 in Manhattan misstated its neighborhood.

            "fulltext": "Rather than cloning the original art-filled Chambers boutique hotel in New York, the Midwestern outpost, which opened in September, strikes an independent profile in a gallerylike compound fashioned from two neighboring pre-1910 brick low-rise office buildings with a a courtyard-cum-lounge in between. Interiors and exteriors showcase the estimable contemporary art collection of the owner, the Minneapolis developer Ralph Burnet, helping to increase Minneapolis's emerging stature as the artiest town on the prairie.  THE LOCATION  Pedestrian friendly. The Chambers's downtown locale is walking distance of theaters, the Target Center sports arena, warehouse district restaurants and retail-centric Nicollet Avenue.  THE ROOMS  The high-tech rooms are a bit cold. A throw rug over the black-stained wood floors would have warmed up my gallery-white standard room, No. 512. But cloudlike feather bedding, down pillows and high-thread-count linens compensate. Business travelers and e-mail users are well served with an expansive desk and countertop that lines an entire wall, as well as with free Wi-Fi and D.S.L. A painting by the local artist Rod Massey, decorative vases and a video art channel on the 42-inch plasma television confirm the art theme.  THE BATHROOMS  Functionally stylish. An opaque window wall in the shower plays peek-a-boo with the entry foyer on the other side. A German-made metal ''ramp'' sink by Alape slopes back toward the blue-glass-tiled wall, heated tiles pave the floor and a 13-inch flat-screen television faces the toilet.  AMENITIES  The Chambers's chief asset is its $7 million art collection spanning painting, sculpture, photography, neon and hybrids like a wall hanging of Indian chipati tongs by Subodh Gupta. Works by Damien Hirst and other marquee artists are displayed in an adjacent gallery that rotates Mr. Burnet's collection, while video art flashes in the lobby, lounge and guestroom corridors.  The \u00fcber-chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten created the menu at the paper-lantern-lighted Chambers Kitchen, where the local fish, walleye, is dressed up with basil and jalapeno ($18). A glass-walled and balcony-ringed bar on the top floor draws a hip, partying crowd, but soundproof doors seal the noise from guestroom hallways.  The outdoor courtyard has a large fire pit and screenings of experimental films on the whitewashed walls. The lobby's shopping nook sells Barbara Kruger tote bags ($65); skateboard decks by a local artist, Sean Tubridy ($58); and Yoshitomo Nara clocks ($250). The basement fitness center was overheated at 75 degrees and offered no privacy from staff members passing in a service corridor.  ROOM SERVICE  Guests must call for morning coffee ($4 per cup) -- there is no maker in the room -- but delivery is speedy. (My order arrived in less than 10 minutes.) All food comes from the Chambers Kitchen, which bears Mr. Vongerichten's stamp even in breakfast basics like a bagel and smoked salmon, which comes with an endive salad dressed in sherry vinaigrette ($16).  THE CROWD  Guests on a Friday night looked like the 40-something sophisticates who might buy the modern art on the walls, whereas the younger, bohemian lounge set looked like those who had created it. With the exception of one indifferent bar host, the helpful hotel staff is free of attitude.  BOTTOM LINE  Art-focused lodgings are poised to appeal to travelers in search of design-forward Minneapolis. The 60 rooms start at $199 and go to $3,500 for the 1,000-square-foot Rock Star Suite with skyline views.  Chambers Minneapolis, 901 Hennepin Avenue, 612-767-6900; www.chambersminneapolis.com.

            "fulltext": "IT might be tempting a curse from the golf gods to enter the Scottsdale city limits without a set of clubs. But it's easy to spend a full weekend here far from the fairways. Just east of Phoenix, Scottsdale was once home to the Hohokam Indians; it was founded in the 1880s by Winfield Scott, an Army chaplain who bought land to farm sweet potatoes. Today, Scottsdale is associated less with farming than with Frank Lloyd Wright, massage therapists and outdoor sports. Wright's influence can be seen in much of the architecture, though a lot of it sits in the shadows of the telltale cranes erecting condos in this ever-expanding region of the West. Golf, if you wish. Or eat, explore and then float in an infinity pool, contemplating your next cocktail.  Friday  7:30 p.m.  1. Starry, Starry Meal  Pay attention on your way to the Star Spangled Tavern (20751 North Pima Road; 480-419-8729; www.starspangledtavern.us), the newest offering from the restaurateurs who created the tiny but popular restaurant row in downtown Scottsdale. The shopping development where this Americana-themed restaurant sits in DC Ranch, an upscale (yes, golf) community in north Scottsdale, can be easy to miss in the dark. Once there, sit under the open sky on the patio and order a flight of wines, like the John Wayne (an array of wines from California, $24), or cold apple cider served in a mason jar ($3). Try the crabby fried green tomatoes ($13), Queen Creek pork chop with creamed corn pudding ($25) and the warm apple and cranberry crisp with brown sugar ice cream ($9). Next door is the Baroque Luxe Lounge, for those who love Champagne, but the scene is a bit snoozy.  10 p.m.  2. Exotic Vintages  Spurn the Baroque, and seek out Kazimierz World Wine Bar (7137 East Stetson Drive, 480-946-3004; www.kazbar.net). Known as the Kaz Bar, it has all the trappings of hipness -- no sign over the door (which is in the back), sofas and a crowd of varying ages and sexual orientation. There are some 2,900 wines from more than 40 nations available -- yes, this is the place to find that elusive Thracian Valley merlot from Bulgaria. And there is live music after 9 p.m. Cavelike and featuring the occasional moment of decoupage on the wall, Kaz Bar makes for good people watching.  Saturday  8 a.m.  3. A Plan Over Pancakes  Scottsdale offers many breakfast options, from the kitschy -- Pischke's Paradise (7217 East First Street, 480-481-0067) -- to the mall-based, like Orange Table Cafe (7373 Scottsdale Mall, 408-424-6819). But the coffee is strong and the banana buttermilk pancakes ($8) yummy at Cafe ZuZu in the Hotel Valley Ho (6850 East Main Street, 480-248-2000; www.hotelvalleyho.com). Sit in the supermodern chairs or comfy booths and plot potential misadventures.  9:30 a.m.  4. Rising Above It All  Work off the wine and pancakes in the Phoenix Mountains Preserve, where hikes of varying degrees of difficulty are plentiful. Huffing up the summit trail of Piestewa Peak in the preserve's northeast district, one alternately dodges or is dodged by sinewy athletes zipping along alone or tourists in the wrong shoes doing their best not to pass out. Hikers climb nearly 1,200 feet in elevation on this moderately difficult trail. Look for saguaro cactuses and coyotes. The trailhead is in the parking lot at the first driveway on the left in Phoenix Mountains Park and Recreation Area: east on Squaw Peak Drive from Lincoln Drive between 22nd and 24th Streets. For more information on hikes in the preserve, log on to www.phoenix.gov/parks or call (602) 495-5458.  Noon  5. A Bit of the Old West  Stroll through Old Town (roughly Second Street to Fourth Street, north to south; Scottsdale Road to Drinkwater Boulevard, west to east), where scores of galleries display everything from works of the masters to American Indian jewelry to large contemporary paintings by local artists. There, too, is questionable Western-themed statuary, store names with puns (Coyo-T's) and the obligatory wind chimes and dried chili peppers lilting and listing in the breeze. Of interest nearby is Guidon Books (7117 East Main Street, 480-945-8811; www.guidon.com), which specializes in out-of-print Western Americana and Civil War volumes.  1 p.m.  6. Then a Taste of the East  While you are in the neighborhood, do as the local residents do and hit Malee's Thai Bistro (7131 East Main Street; 480-947-6042; www.maleesthaibistro.com), a softly lighted room that muffles the sun-drenched action outside. The best bets are the tofu spinach pot stickers ($7.95), evil jungle princess (a pile of chicken doused in coconut cream with mushrooms and fresh mint, $12.25), and the reliable pad Thai ($13.25).  2:30 p.m.  7. There's Always the Rub  The ways to get pummeled, peeled and rubbed in Scottsdale are endless, and there seems to be an almost Constitutional obligation to do so. From the shoulder rubs at the most commonplace hair salons to the in-room ''ceremonies'' featuring 100 percent freeze-dried seawater (30 minutes, $85) for guests at the gorgeous Sanctuary Spa at the Camelback Mountain Resort and Spa (5700 East McDonald Drive, 480-948-2100; www.sanctuaryoncamelback.com), there is something for every (reasonably generous) budget. Right in the middle is the VH Spa for Vitality and Health at the Hotel Valley Ho (www.hotelvalleyho.com), where the Back, Neck, Shoulders massage was heaven (45 minutes, $95, not counting an automatic 20 percent tip) and the Oh! So Cool Foot Refresher (30 minutes, $65) can literally put you to sleep. The spa even offers treatments for dog guests: a canine massage, 30 minutes for $85.  5 p.m.  8. Serenity, Inside and Out  Start dinner right at Elements (480-607-2300, www.elementsrestaurant.com), which is at the Sanctuary resort, by angling for just the right seat on the patio at the Jade Bar, where you can watch the sunset while eavesdropping on first-daters as you munch on wasabi-covered peanuts. This moment is best paired with an Asian pear cucumber and ginger martini ($14) or a glass of sparkling rose ($20). Those looking to impress might order the $55 margarita, but we're not sure why. You will want to ask for a window booth inside the restaurant, where the chef, Beau MacMillan, cooks up seasonal fare as you take in Paradise Valley. The view is really the main course, but there are some standout offerings on the changing menu, like grilled salmon ($27), carrot and millet pot stickers ($11) and a diabolical banana Fluffernutter sundae ($10). The Zen-like setting with stone and fireplaces is serene.  8:30 p.m.  9. Luck Would Be Nice  Somewhere, say, between the glitz of the Venetian casino in Las Vegas and the smoke-choked spots on the Mississippi coast is Casino Arizona 101 & Indian Bend (9700 East Indian Bend Road; 480-850-7777; www.casinoaz.com), a low-key gambling hall run by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indians. Try your luck at blackjack (minimum bets range from $5 to $25), or develop a case of repetitive stress injury by yanking on the slots as a cover band oozes the hits of Lionel Richie.  Sunday  9:30 a.m.  10. The Architect's Home  Do not miss Taliesin West, the international headquarters for the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and the winter campus for the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture (12621 Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard; 480-860-2700; www.franklloydwright.org). Troubled by poor health, Wright took up half-year residence in this 600-acre ''camp'' in 1937, and the complex was built by apprentices. Take the 90-minute tour, (9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily on the half-hour for $22.50, children 4 to 12 $15) which takes you through the living quarters, working areas and outdoor spaces that incorporate indigenous materials and organic forms. Then there's all that Asian art.  Noon  11. Exit Strategy  It's not quite Scottsdale, but just a few exits past the off ramp for the airport on Route 202 is the Phoenix Ranch Market, (1602 East Roosevelt Street, Phoenix; 602-254-6676) a 53,000-square-foot emporium of groceries featuring a food court full of Mexican goodies. One of the best meals around -- and, without a doubt, the best bargain -- is the three tacos for $2.89, with pork or beef or chicken decorated with cheese and cilantro for a tasty goodbye.  THE BASICS  Many airlines serve Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. Carriers with nonstops from from the New York City area include JetBlue, US Airways, Continental and America West. Southwest goes nonstop from Los Angeles.  The Hotel Valley Ho (6850 East Main Street; 866-882-4484; www.hotelvalleyho.com) is an inviting mid-20th-century hotel made chic by a 2004 renovation. It has a nice, low-key spa, a pool, a Trader Vic's restaurant and the cute Cafe ZuZu. It's within walking distance of Old Town Scottsdale. Rooms start at $259 at this time of year, excluding tax and parking.  Sanctuary Camelback Mountain Resort and Spa (5700 East McDonald Drive, Paradise Valley; 800-245-2051; www.sanctuaryoncamelback.com) is a former tennis ranch that has become a truly secluded and elegant spot with its infinity pool and serene spa. The rooms are contemporary with Asian accents, wood-burning fireplaces and canopy beds. Rooms start at $495 in high season, excluding tax and parking.  The 3 Palms Resort Oasis (7707 East McDowell Road; 800-450-8133; www.scottsdale-resort-hotels.com) is a good budget option, with rooms starting at $129 in late January. This contemporary low-rise hotel offers a few things that budget hotels often do not, like views of Camelback Mountain from some rooms, 400-thread-count sheets, down comforters and shuttle service within five miles of the property.  36 HOURS",

Enter HotelsByCity.net, a hotel reservation site, which started a ''Hotel Blog'' section in November filled with candid photos and videos on everything from beds to bathrooms.  In the ''Hotel Throne'' section, there are not only photos of bathrooms all over the world (one in Japan has a sign stating ''On using a shower of toilet please stand up after you have stopped them'') and examples of bizarre art in hotels' public toilets (photos of women, one of them with a magnifying glass, looking down on the urinals), but also pictures of bathrooms with a view.

            "fulltext": "If Rossini had been in the audience on Thursday night at the Harry de Jur Playhouse, he would surely have found the stylish and witty new production of ''Il Signor Bruschino'' by the Gotham Chamber Opera as cheekily funny as everyone else did.  The revival was overdue. ''Il Signor Bruschino,'' the last of five one-act farces Rossini wrote for the Teatro San Mois\u00e8 in Venice between 1810 and 1813, was last staged in New York in 1933, according to the Gotham company.  In this frothy, youthful comedy, Rossini experiments with the comic gift for mistaken identities evident in his later opera ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia.'' The Venetian poet Giuseppe Maria Foppa wrote the libretto for ''Bruschino,'' based on ''Le Fils par Hazard,'' a French farce. Two young lovers, Florville and Sofia, want to marry. But Florville is the son of an enemy of Gaudenzio, Sofia's guardian, who in any event has already promised her to the eminent Bruschino family. Florville waylays and impersonates the legitimate groom, then convinces Gaudenzio that he is Bruschino's son.  Thanks to Robin Guarino's clever directing, an opera that could be mere bumbling slapstick is sharp, with snappy comic timing. Donald Eastman's set updates the action to the Via Veneto in Rome in about 1960. The costume designer Martin Pakledinaz presents Florville, sung by Alek Shrader, as a sort of Marcello Mastroianni, and Sofia, sung by Lisa Hopkins, as a demurely dressed Anita Ekberg.  There were other Felliniesque touches, like a Vespa, a bicycle, a priest and a scampering little boy who knocks on a door to mirror the moment in the overture when the violinists tap their music stands with their bows.  ''Il Signor Bruschino'' has plenty of tongue-twisting recitative and vocal acrobatics, but none of the strong cast seemed trapped in a coloratura torture chamber. At times they even made a merry farce of Rossini's bel canto obstacle course.  There was fiery chemistry between Ms. Hopkins and Mr. Shrader, both promising performers, who sang with good phrasing and control. Eric Jordan gave a fine, confident performance as the jovial, fabulously named Gaudenzio Strappapuppole, who almost seems a personification of Rossini, a cheery, witty gourmand.  Signor Bruschino was updated from a generic buffo character to an oily, scholarly-looking, suit-clad neurotic, excellently acted and sung by Marco Nistico.  As the maid Marianna, Emily Langford Johnson was a sexy, Sophia Loren-like flirt, while Filiberto, the burly barman, was sung with aplomb by Matthew Lau. Steven Goldstein, as the police commissioner and priest, was also strong.  Neal Goren, Gotham's artistic director, conducted a lively, tight performance of the chirpy score. Rossini reportedly declared that he was ''born for opera buffa.'' On Thursday night it seemed that this cast had been as well.  ''Il Signor Bruschino'' continues through Feb. 3 at the Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org.

(Brantley)  'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  * ' 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)  'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  Off Broadway  'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)  *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger)  'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)  'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)  'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)  'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)  'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)  'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)  'RIDDLELIKELOVE (WITH A SIDE OF KETCHUP)' This one-woman show, in which Julie Fitzpatrick tells of her friendship with a deaf woman, is cloying and thin, but the sign-language interpretation provided at each performance gives it an interesting extra dimension, helping to bring the subject to life (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)  'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)  'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)  '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)  'TWO TRAINS RUNNING'  Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)  * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  Off Off Broadway  'FLUKE' A meditative collage of enigmatic riffs on ''Moby-Dick'' presented by the rambunctious experimental company Radiohole (1:30). Collapsable Hole, 146 Metropolitan Avenue, at Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-2251. (Jason Zinoman)  'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)  Long-Running Shows  'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley)  Last Chance  'BUTLEY'  In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)  'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.  'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott)  'BLACK CHRISTMAS' (R, 100 minutes) It's been more than 30 years since the original ''Black Christmas'' revealed how much fun it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Glen Morgan's disastrous remake not only sidelines the original's hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Smothering terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, the movie is no more than a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. (Jeannette Catsoulis)  'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)  * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)  'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)  'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)  * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)  'CODE NAME: THE CLEANER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) Cedric the Entertainer clogs the arteries of what could have been a savvy riff on the ''Bourne'' films with way too much ham, playing a janitor who wakes up with amnesia, a dead man beside him. A missing computer chip fuels the plot, aided by Lucy Liu and Nicollette Sheridan. Though it's all too dumb to amuse grownups, it's harmless fun for tweener types. (Neil Genzlinger)  'COMEDY OF POWER' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) Isabelle Huppert is brisk and fierce as a French investigative judge going after corrupt fat cats. The director, Claude Chabrol, is more interested in the forms of ruling-class behavior than in the details of high-level criminality, but his detached, complacent style makes for an interesting contrast with Ms. Huppert's conviction. (Scott)  'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)  'THE DEAD GIRL' (R, 93 minutes) An impressively well-acted movie, ''The Dead Girl'' has a chip on its shoulder. The relentless emotional violence in it, a compendium of five vignettes related to a young woman whose naked, mutilated corpse is discovered on a barren hillside, is of a level rarely found in movies, even those steeped in gore. There is some gore in ''The Dead Girl,'' but it is eclipsed in intensity by the verbal abuse hurled by its desperately unhappy characters at the people closest to them. (Stephen Holden)  * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)  'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)  'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)  * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)  'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)  'FREEDOM WRITERS' (PG-13, 123 minutes) Hilary Swank uses her characteristic neediness to fine effect in a true-to-life story about a teacher making a difference in a Southern California high school. The writer and director Richard LaGravenese provides the smartly laid foundation, but it's the kids who give the film its strong emotional tug. (Dargis)  'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)  'HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER' (PG, 87 minutes) Like Dreamworks's ''Shrek'' comedies, ''Happily'' is a grab-bag parody set in a fantasyland derived from bedtime stories and Disney films. The adopted chambermaid Ella (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar, drawn like Winona Ryder) and the poor dishwasher Rick (Freddie Prinze Jr.) battle Ella's wicked stepmother, Frieda (Sigourney Weaver). Despite self-aware touches, this is another tired kidsploitation product in which a wasp-waisted ing\u00e9nue and a shallow beau drive the plot and live happily ever after. (Matt Zoller Seitz)  'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)  * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)  'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)  * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)  * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)  'MISS POTTER' (PG, 92 minutes) In ''Miss Potter,'' Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, her face pickled in cheeriness, is Beatrix Potter, the creator of Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin and Mrs. Tittlemouse, among other beloved characters in children's literature. As portrayed by Ms. Zellweger, Potter is almost as chipper as Julie Andrews's Mary Poppins, a proto-feminist, proto-environmentalist and perfect lady to boot. There was plenty of drama in Potter's life, but the movie turns major conflicts and losses into minor setbacks in a charmed, entirely virtuous life. The movie is far too nice for its own good. (Holden)  'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) In this chaotic, overstuffed family comedy, Ben Stiller is a night watchman at the American Museum of Natural History, where the exhibits come to life at night and attack him and one another. This computerized spectacle spares no expense, but the storytelling is weak, and the hit-or-miss jokes miss more than hit. (Holden)  'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zo\u00eb Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis)  * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott)  'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)  'PERFUME: THE STORY OF A MURDERER' (R, 147 minutes) There's no other way to say it: Tom Tykwer's excruciatingly literal-minded adaptation of the best-selling novel about an 18th-century serial killer with an acute sense of smell is a real stinker. (Scott)  'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)  * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)  'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)  'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)  'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)  * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)  'WE ARE MARSHALL' (PG, 128 minutes) This fact-based story of a West Virginia college town recovering from the death of its entire football team in a 1970 plane crash is a stiff, manipulative dud that gets wrong everything ''Friday Night Lights'' got right. Matthew McConaughey hams it up as the college's goofy new coach, who whips the replacement team into decent shape. (Holden)  Film Series  Sven Nykvist Remembered (Tonight through Sunday) Three films this weekend highlight the achievements of this great Swedish cinematographer, who died in September. ''The Silence'' (1963) is one of several films he shot for the director Ingmar Bergman, this time in brooding black and white; ''An-Margritt'' is a 1969 Norwegian film by Arne Skouen featuring one of Mr. Bergman's favorite performers, Liv Ullmann, as a young woman struggling to survive in a 17th-century mining community; ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (1989) finds Woody Allen in a Bergmanesque mood, contemplating the silence of God as Nykvist lights a strangely Nordic New York City. Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (David Kehr)  CRITICS CHOICE: GREAT DOCUMENTARIES (Tomorrow and Sunday) Members of the New York Film Critics Circle introduce some of their favorite nonfiction films. ''The Thin Blue Line,'' presented tomorrow by Mike D'Angelo of Esquire magazine, is the 1993 Errol Morris film that reopened a Dallas murder case, resulting in the exoneration of the man convicted for the crime, told in a slick, semifictional style. Also tomorrow, Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger offers ''Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills,'' a look at a multiple killing in the deep South by the directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, who will attend. On Sunday, J. Hoberman of The Village Voice reaches further back into the past for Dziga Vertov's deliriously subjective Soviet propaganda film of 1928, ''The Man with a Movie Camera,'' which will be shown in an archival print from the George Eastman House. (Through Feb. 25.) Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10.

TUNDE ADEBIMPE AND ALIANnA KALABA (Tomorrow) Time was when the members of TV on the Radio, now the most critically adored band in New York, played in tiny clubs, blending electronic noises with Tunde Adebimpe's haunting falsetto. They have since graduated to much bigger gigs, but tomorrow at Tonic, the Lower East Side headquarters of the avant-garde, Mr. Adebimpe collaborates with Alianna Kalaba, the drummer of the Chicago band We Ragazzi. What will they do? Perhaps they don't even know, and that's why it will be good. Also on the bill are Pit Er Pat, Matteah Baim and Bear in Heaven. At 10 p.m., 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $10. (Ben Sisario)  ANTI-SOCIAL MUSIC (Tomorrow) The final frontier for weird rock is classical music. Anti-Social Music, a collective of New York musicians who play in various pop and new-music bands -- including some big ones, like the Hold Steady -- is one of a handful of groups that boldly go into this realm, playing works for strings, woodwinds and other instruments by its 11 members (six of whom have degrees in music composition, the group's Web site, antisocialmusic.org, declares). Skeptics note: it can get pretty rowdy. At 9 p.m., BAMCaf\u00e9, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; no cover. (Sisario)  MAX BEMIS (Sunday) Screamed warnings of being at the end of one's rope are standard issue in emo. But Mr. Bemis, the singer of the Los Angeles band Say Anything, isn't kidding: the group's latest release was delayed when he went missing, only to turn up in a mental institution in Houston. His songs bounce manically from exuberant to cynical, tender to bombastic, and, even at their most despairing, have a certain swaggering showmanship. He plays a solo acoustic show with Andy Jackson, the guitarist of the band Hot Rod Circuit. At 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12. (Sisario)  ANDREW BIRD (Wednesday) A talented multi-instrumentalist, Mr. Bird shows off his fiddle and guitar playing in songs that are as wistful as they are fantastical. But his most impressive technique is not on fiddle or guitar, nor on the electronic effects that he uses to make the music breathe; rather, it's his dexterous, expressive whistling, which floats high above in eerily beautiful tones. With John Southworth. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)  CARNIVORE (Tomorrow) For fans of obscure New York metal only: before founding Type O Negative, Peter Steele led Carnivore, one of the most aggressive and, perhaps not coincidentally, offensive bands of the mid-'80s thrash scene. (Typical song title: ''Jesus Hitler.'') The new version of the band does not include any original members besides Mr. Steele. With Krieg, Lair of the Minotaur, A.C., Embalmer, Dimentianon and Annunaki. At 7 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $30. (Sisario)  * COLD WAR KIDS (Wednesday) The craggy guitars and piano, verge-of-a-breakdown vocals and elliptical songwriting of this band from Austin, Tex., put it at the top of the music-blogger food chain last year. Now comes the hard part: maintaining popularity as the Internet eye roves again. This month the band is bouncing back and forth between New York and Los Angeles each week in a ''bicoastal residency.'' At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; sold out. (Sisario)  ROBERT CRAY (Tuesday) The embodiment of the clean, commercial -- some might say rootless -- style that has defined the blues since the 1980s, Mr. Cray has an elegant touch with his Fender Stratocaster, and sings about desire and infidelity in a cool croon that is closer to pop than to Howlin' Wolf. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $47 in advance, $50 at the door. (Sisario)  dB'S (Tomorrow) In the early 1980s, the dB's, four guys from North Carolina who relocated to New York, were local favorites for their nervy, hummable hybrid of New Wave and the jangly pop-rock of the Byrds and Big Star, with some country thrown in as well. The reunited band -- Peter Holsapple, Chris Stamey, Will Rigby and Gene Holder -- recorded a song for Hurricane Katrina relief and are working on a new album. The two opening acts here are family: Mitch Easter and his band, and the Sneakers, consisting of Mr. Stamey, Mr. Rigby, Mr. Easter and Robert Keely. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)  MARK EITZEL (Thursday) Depression is Mr. Eitzel's element; as leader of the American Music Club and through a solo career, he has anatomized melancholy down to the molecular level. In a weary voice, with tunes that blur folk songs and torch songs in a smoky haze, he looks at estrangement and betrayal, loneliness and separation, and bad luck. It's easy to believe him when he sings, ''I'm tired to the bone of always telling you goodbye.'' With the Black Swans. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Jon Pareles)  * FALL OUT BOY (Tuesday) One of the first groups to get wide attention for its popularity on MySpace, Fall Out Boy, from Chicago, is the model second-wave (or is this the third?) emo band: snarky and jumpy, interested in relationships over solitude, and bursting with melodic pop-punk riffs that come down from Green Day and Blink-182. With New Found Glory, Lifetime and Permanent Me. At 6:15 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $35.

(Sisario)  GRUPO NICHE, JIMMY BOSCH (Tomorrow) Grupo Niche, from Colombia, holds on to the high-powered horns-and-percussion salsa forged in the 1970s. Jimmy Bosch is a trombonist who savors the Latin jazz tradition of the descarga, a jam session everyone can dance to. This ''hard salsa'' takes musical chances but never lets go of the beat. At 8 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West and Goulden Avenue, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $30 to $45.

Playing the sintir (a long-necked, resonant lute), Mr. Hakmoun leads spellbinding trance ceremonies, and with castanets around his ankles, performs acrobatic dances. Also on the bill is Berber music by Abderahim Boutat. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 545-7536,symphonyspace.org or worldmusicinstitute.org; $27; $15 for students.

(Pareles)  LITTLE RICHARD (Monday) He may always be most celebrated for bringing scat to rock (''A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boom!''), but Little Richard's delirious falsetto ''oooh!'' and androgynous showmanship have influenced everybody from Paul McCartney to Prince. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $60 in advance, $64 at the door.

(Pareles)  LIZ McCOMB (Thursday) A mezzo pop-gospel singer who grew up in Cleveland but has lived in Europe for the last 25 years, Ms. McComb moves from smoothness to Pentecostal abandon; she has been something of an ambassador in France and not that well known in her home country.

(Stephen Holden)  RON SEXSMITH (Tonight) Mr. Sexsmith seems self-effacing and hesitant at first, with a voice that sidles up to notes like a wallflower trying to slip into a party unnoticed. But behind the outward modesty is a craftsman who stubbornly upholds the verities of 1960s songwriting, placing supple melodies atop unexpected harmonies and offering wistful regret and consolation in equal parts. With Kim Taylor. At 8:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $17. (Pareles)  SLOAN (Thursday) Like modern metafictions, Sloan's pop-rock songs twist inward on themselves. With their winsome tunes and neo-Beatles intricacies, Sloan's songs are not just about unrequited yearnings, but also about the process of writing pop songs about unrequited yearnings. They're rarely so clever that their heart doesn't come through. With Spiral Beach and the Love Loves.

(Chinen)  JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. Her Tuesday night engagement features different players each week; this time around, the cast includes the clarinetist Doug Wieselman and the guitarist Steve Cardenas. At 7 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)  TERELL STAFFORD (Tomorrow) Mr. Stafford, a bright and assertive trumpeter, previews material from his next album, ''New Beginnings'' (MaxJazz), with a quintet that includes Tim Warfield Jr. on saxophones, Bruce Barth at the piano, Derrick Hodge on bass and Dana Hall on drums. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30. (Chinen)  LOREN STILLMAN AND TRIO ALTO (Thursday) ''Trio Alto Volume One'' (Steeplechase), the most recent album by the alto saxophonist Loren Stillman, suggests an explorer with one foot planted in tradition and the other caught in midstride. Mr. Stillman leads a different rhythm section here -- Sean Conly on bass and Take Toriyama on drums -- but his confident and probing approach should come across just fine. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)  * TERRASSON, OKEGWO, PARKER (Wednesday and Thursday) Throughout the latter half of the 1990s, the pianist Jacky Terrasson led one of jazz's fresher-sounding acoustic piano trios, distinguished not only by his fluid pianism but also by the resonant bass tone of Ugonna Okegwo and the pared-down percussive drive of Leon Parker. Last spring the trio regrouped as a collective, with uneven but deeply promising results. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  J. D. WALTER / REFUGE TRIO (Tomorrow) J. D. Walter's voice is a flexible instrument, given to soaring scat solos and growling burrs.

At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)  Classical  Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.  Opera  * 'CONCRETE' (Wednesday and Thursday) Robert Ashley's operas have been compared to James Joyce's writing: the composer examines the ordinary world, and its language, by running it through the filters of his own creativity. ''Concrete,'' here in its world premiere, is billed as ''an old man's musing'' about people he has cared about. Mr. Ashley's orchestra will consist of computer samples that vary at each performance, and the singers will key their pitches and inflections to the sounds, creating music truly born of speech, with a conversational spontaneity. Many of the singers have worked with Mr. Ashley for decades, including Joan La Barbara, Jacqueline Humbert and Sam Ashley, the composer's son. (Through Jan. 21.) At 8 p.m., La MaMa Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15 and $20. (Anne Midgette)  'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tomorrow) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread interest among the general public in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score to ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' have resulted in a sold-out run for ''The First Emperor.'' Though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving, ponderous and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. His music, though, seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)  * 'MOSTLY OPERETTA' (Tonight, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) Once popular entertainment, today often presented as hackneyed spectacle, operetta deserves to be rehabilitated for the 21st century. At least, this is the premise of an ambitious festival at the Austrian Cultural Forum that presents both the familiar (excerpts from Lehar's ''Merry Widow'') and the less familiar (Lehar's little-known songs), sung by operetta specialists, with innovative, cutting-edge visuals by Victoria Coeln. Tonight's program (in English) is a salute to operettas that appeared on Broadway; Monday and Tuesday's is an all-Lehar program; and Thursday's juxtaposes Lehar and Kalman with less-known composers like Rudolf Friml and Leo Fall. Tonight at 8 (introductory lecture at 7); Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7; 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required. (Midgette)  NEW YORK GILBERT AND SULLIVAN PLAYERS (Tonight through Sunday) When this troupe was founded by Albert Bergeret in 1974, it was one of a handful of small companies devoted to the Savoyard repertory in New York. Now it is the only one left, and its performances, with Mr. Bergeret still at the helm, and with casts well drilled in the style, are always a treat. Its current season includes two perennial favorites, ''The Mikado'' and ''Yeomen of the Guard,'' and the company can be counted on to bring their splendid silliness to life. ''The Mikado'' is tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.; ''Yeomen of the Guard'' is tomorrow night at 8. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $40 to $96. (Allan Kozinn)  * 'OTELLO' (Wednesday) Rossini's 1816 version of ''Otello'' predates Verdi's great opera by more than 70 years. Choosing Shakespeare's complex play as a subject was a risky stroke for Rossini at the time. The Naples opera company that presented it forced the composer to tweak, soften and simplify the story. The first two acts are uneven. But the great third act, dominated by Rossini's noble music for the anguished Desdemona, struck the composer Meyerbeer as ''really godlike.'' The Opera Orchestra of New York is billing its concert performance as the first New York presentation of Rossini's work. In any event, the cast looks promising, with the soprano Ruxandra Donose as Desdemona and the tenor Robert McPherson as Iago. (The tenor Ram\u00f3n Vargas was to have sung the title role, but dropped out because of illness; he is being replaced by Bruce Ford.) Eve Queler conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)  'THE TENDER LAND' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In 1976, when the enterprising Bronx Opera Company first presented Copland's ''Tender Land,'' the composer participated in rehearsals and attended productions. For its current production, the company is using the effective chamber version of the orchestral score, arranged by Murry Sidlin. Royston Coppenger is the director. Elizabeth W. Scott conducts tomorrow, and Michael Spierman on Sunday. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Lovinger Theater, Lehman College, Bedford Park Boulevard West and Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, bronxopera.org; $15 to $30. (Tommasini)  'LE VILLI' (Tonight through Sunday) This opera, Puccini's first work for the stage, is a short tale of a trusting young woman from a Black Forest town in medieval Germany who is forsaken by her betrothed. When the grieving woman dies, her guilt-stricken fianc\u00e9 is subjected to supernatural justice. Though the score was deeply influenced by operatic styles of the day, Puccini's intensely lyrical and richly harmonic voice comes through. The adventurous Dicapo Opera Theater presents a choreographic production of this seldom-heard work on a double bill with a staged performance of Puccini's major sacred work, the ''Messa di Gloria.'' Francisco Bonnin conducts. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, at St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini)  'DIE ZAUBERFL\u00d6TE' (Tonight) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. James Levine conducts a cast that includes Lisa Milne as Pamina, Erika Miklosa as Queen of the Night, Matthew Polenzani as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno, Eike Wilm Schulte as the Speaker and Morris Robinson as Sarastro. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 tickets remaining. (Vivien Schweitzer)  Classical Music  ISABEL BAYRAKDARIAN AND RUSSELL BRAUN (Sunday) Patriotism has brought the fine Canadian soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian and the light Canadian baritone Russell Braun together frequently before. But the motivation for this weekend's joint recital is the George London Foundation, which presents the two singers, together with their spouses, the pianists Carolyn Maule and Serouj Kradjian, in a program of Schumann, Schubert, Debussy and Pauline Viardot (whose songs Ms. Bayrakdarian has recorded, very well). At 4 p.m., Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 877-6347, www.themorgan.org; $45; $30 for Morgan members. (Midgette)  CALEFAX (Sunday) The intimate chamber music hall at the Frick Collection has become a reliable place to discover soloists and ensembles who are new to New York but prove durable additions to the city's musical life. Calefax, a reed quintet from the Netherlands, makes its debut with an era-spanning program that runs from music by Ockeghem (born in 1410) through Sander Germanus (born in 1972). At 5 p.m., 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; $25. (Kozinn)  CARNEGIE HALL FESTIVAL CHORUS (Tomorrow) Helmuth Rilling leads the Carnegie Hall Festival Chorus and the excellent Orchestra of St. Luke's in a performance of Bach's monumental ''St. Matthew Passion.'' The soloists are the tenor James Taylor, who sings the Evangelist; the bass Klaus H\u00e4ger, who sings Jesus; the soprano Sibylla Rubens; the mezzo-soprano Ingeborg Danz; the tenor Thomas Cooley; and the bass Michael Nagy. At 7 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $82. (Schweitzer)  CHAMBERFEST (Tuesday through Thursday) ChamberFest is an appropriate name for this series of concerts, which showcase Juilliard students who have spent their final week of winter break in daily rehearsals and coaching sessions. The program on Tuesday includes Strauss's ''Till Eulenspiegels Lustige Streiche'' and Debussy's String Quartet; Wednesday night's concert includes Ravel's ''Introduction et Allegro'' and Brahms's Clarinet Trio, while on Thursday, works by Prokofiev, Brahms and Walton will be performed. At 8 p.m., Paul Hall, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. (Schweitzer)  * EIGHTH BLACKBIRD (Tonight and tomorrow) This inventive and energetic young new-music ensemble from Chicago has built its audience with eclectic programming and commissioning. It has also impressed listeners by playing complex scores by memory, a feat rarely seen in ensembles playing even much more familiar music. The group's program tonight includes works by Steve Mackey, Jennifer Higdon, Gordon Fitzell and David M. Gordon. Tomorrow it is performing as part of the closing concert of the Chamber Music America national conference. Tonight at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; $10.

Max Levinson, her husband, is the pianist. At 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)  GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Sunday) In its continuing campaign to make classical music available to all, the indispensable Peoples' Symphony Concerts, which offer leading artists and ensembles at very affordable prices, present the Guarneri String Quartet at Town Hall in a program of works by Haydn, Dohnanyi and Dvorak. At 2 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9 and $11. (Tommasini)  MET ORCHESTRA (Sunday) High in fiber, high in calories and generally high in content, the Met Orchestra's Carnegie Hall concerts are the Danny Meyer meals of classical music. They are long, satisfying and generally delectable, depending on the condition of the chef-conductor, James Levine. The program offers something for every taste, including the expected high-modernist course -- the premiere of ''Theologoumenon'' by Charles Wuorinen -- and the expected star soloist: the brilliant, rigorous violinist Christian Tetzlaff, playing the Beethoven concerto. But the main course is the Brahms Third. At 3 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $50 to $160. (Midgette)  NEW YORK COLLEGIUM (Tonight) Those favoring a reductive sweep of music history called Arnold Schoenberg and his contemporaries the Second Viennese school, the implication being that the thriving music world running roughly from Mozart through Beethoven and Schubert was the First. But what of Viennese music before that? The New York Collegium explores Baroque-era Viennese music, with works by Biber, Schmelzer and others who might prove worth a fresh look. At 8 (preconcert talk at 7), Church of St. Vincent Ferrer, Lexington Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 717-9246, nycollegium.org; $30 to $60. (Kozinn)  NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) Zubin Mehta, music director of the Philharmonic from 1978 to 1991, returns to conduct the orchestra in Bruckner's Symphony No. 7. But the highlight of the evening is likely to be Alisa Weilerstein, a passionate and highly talented 24-year-old cellist, who makes her subscription debut with the orchestra, playing Elgar's intense Cello Concerto. On Thursday Riccardo Muti conducts a program including Scriabin's ''Divin Po\u00e8me'' and Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, with the excellent Russian violinist Vadim Repin as soloist. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96. (Schweitzer)  'SONGS OF PEACE AND WAR' (Wednesday) Delving into the song repertory to uncover surprising and pleasing nuggets, the New York Festival of Song has as much to teach singers as audiences. For their second collaboration with singers enrolled at the Juilliard School, the directors Steven Blier and Michael Barrett return to a program that originated in 2003, offering a range of songs, by composers from Shostakovich to Bob Dylan, on themes that remain all too timely. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, www .nyfos.org; free, but tickets are required. (Midgette)  TRIBUTE TO ARTURO TOSCANINI (Tuesday) The Symphonica Toscanini, founded last year in Rome, with Lorin Maazel as its music director, is introducing itself to New York in a collaboration with Mr. Maazel's other orchestra, the New York Philharmonic. The concert, billed as a tribute to the Italian orchestra's namesake on the 50th anniversary of his death, includes Strauss's ''Don Juan'' and Tchaikovsky's ''Francesca da Rimini,'' as well as arias by Cilea, Puccini and Rossini. Ren\u00e9e Fleming is the soloist. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $50 to $175. (Kozinn)  Dance  Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

Yes, that Taye Diggs.

For this event's 10th anniversary, the Japan Society has relocated to the Joyce. But the eclectic, pop-influenced sampler should be just as strange and beguiling as ever. Two programs feature work by Pappa Tarahumara, Kim Itoh & the Glorious Future, Leni-Basso and Noism07. (Through Jan. 21.) Tuesday through Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $30; $23 for members. (La Rocco)  * LOWER LIGHTS COLLECTIVE (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) Members of this multimedia group have worked with some pretty impressive people in dance. And how can you go wrong with a group that describes its collaborative process as ignoring one another while allowing for the subtle influence of what is seen out of the corner of the eye? In its new ''CRAM,'' the group will pour dance; a ''live horror film''; sound and noise installations; a ''living sculpture'' using potatoes as percussion; and an orchestra of instruments made from architectural salvage into every cranny of this space.

The project continues on Wednesday and Thursday with ''Tradition and Innovation'' (George Balanchine's ''Mozartiana'' and ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,'' and Mauro Bigonzetti's ''In Vento'').

A collaboration with the visual artist Kenjiro Okazaki and the performance artist Laurie Anderson, ''robots'' will feature what Mr. Okazaki describes as two interactive ''sculptural apparitions.'' The evening also includes performances of Ms. Brown's 1983 ''Set and Reset'' and her 2005 ''how long does the subject linger on the edge of the volume?'' (Through Jan. 21.)

Museums  * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)  China Institute: 'Shu,' through Feb. 24. This second installation of a two-part show glances back at the period of artistic expansion in the 1970s, and its contraction, after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Qiu Zhijie's photographic ''library,'' which papers the walls of the China Institute's main staircase, makes evident the information explosion in the 80s. Among the thousands of titles are Chinese classics, books on natural sciences and treatises by Plato, Disraeli and Harold Bloom. Such a trove might have been considered a treasure before Tiananmen Square; afterward, such resources became sources of angst. The figure that appears throughout Zhang Xiaogang's 1991 series ''Private Notes,'' for example, looks as if he is losing his mind -- and his head, torso and myriad other body parts -- as he struggles to write letters and decode illegible manuscripts. Without easy access to words, the images imply, there can be no such thing as free expression. 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)  Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)  * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)  * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)  * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)  * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)  * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)  Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Holland Cotter)  Galleries: Chelsea  * SERGIO PREGO To take the fullest pleasure in this exhibition, you must stand perfectly still and quiet in front of ''Black Monday'' (2006), a single-channel video of still life photographs of con trolled fireworks explosions taken inside an abandoned factory in Bilbao, Spain. In all, the artist took more than a thousand photographs of 17 different explosions, using 40 cameras. He then scanned them into a computer, cropped them and ran them together to create the video. He also composed what he calls ''a sequencing of sounds,'' a series of repeating ambient electronic noises that serve as the soundtrack. The result is a multifaceted representation of something that is usually invisible to the eye: explosion clouds immobilized in time and space, forming immensely beautiful sculptural shapes. Lehmann Maupin Gallery, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-2923, www.lehmannmaupin.com, through Feb 10. (Benjamin Genocchio)  Last Chance  * HENRY DARGER: THE VIVIAN GIRLS EMERGE Further proof that Henry Darger's epic art did not spring whole from a fevered outsider brain is provided by a cache of his early forays into image collecting and collage. Most spectacular is ''The Battle of Calverhine,'' a leathery, reliclike panorama of carefully knit and hand-tinted found images. It teems with all things Darger (and not a little Pop) and has never been exhibited in this country. Andrew Edlin Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9723; closes tomorrow. (Smith)  * CANDIDA HOFER  In large color photographs of the different galleries of the Louvre, taken on Tuesdays when the museum is closed, both the long, vaulted spaces and the painting and sculpture they contain speak of different times and styles. Equally affecting, if not a little frightening, is the lavish, timeless grandeur of these vistas. A palace that became a museum, the Louvre is also a precursor of the barrel-vaulted arcades that sprang up in Paris in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them are gone, but the Louvre's arcades live on. Sort of. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1018; closes tomorrow(Smith)  NINA KATCHADOURIAN: 'OFFICE SEMAPHORE' Ms. Katchadourian has borrowed marine flag signaling techniques to create an interactive art project consisting of an old-fashioned tourist telescope installed at the corner of a plaza in the middle of the financial district, its lens trained on the window of an upper-floor office in a nearby skyscraper. Each day the man working in the office, or his assistant, arranges objects on his widow sill. The combination and order of the objects represent a specific message, which viewers down on the plaza can interpret using a key-chart on the telescope. 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, corner of Liberty and William Streets, Lower Manhattan; stairway entrance to the plaza is on William Street, at Cedar Street; www.publicartfund.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio)  * The MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT' The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. They are complemented by tiny independent watercolors that Mr. Scully sees as ''antidotes'' to the big ones. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks), whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. ''I'm trying to turn stone into light,'' Mr. Scully has said, and the more you look at them, the more filled with light and life they become. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Monday. (Glueck)  HELEN MIRRA: BREAK CAMP This show of carefully composed, low-lying sculptures made from cut-up wood pallets has a smooth, almost Zen serenity, but its thoughtful brand of Post-Minimalism seems both precious and overly familiar, creating the impression of an engaging sensibility that could aim much higher. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154; closes tomorrow. (Smith)  * Museum of Arts & Design: 'Simply DROOG: 10 + 3 YEARS OF CREATING DISCUSSION AND INNOVATION' . Droog Design, a many-headed, loosely affiliated collective of usually, but not entirely, Dutch designers and architects, has probably generated more discussion than innovation in its 13 years of existence. Presented in a free-flowing, Droog-designed layout, this show vigorously continues the process. It includes about 150 mostly domestic objects by scores of designers. Some are great, some are silly, some are Conceptual Art. But there is plenty to sink your teeth into, especially with help from the small free brochure containing label information and rationales for each item. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)  * Moma: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS' This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Smith)  * P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER'  With 46 artists and a mix of usual and unusual suspects, this exhibition forms a black hole in which Dada, Fluxus, Punk, Pop, Conceptual and Neo-Conceptual mingle like cackling furies, along with Performance art, feminism, abject art and various forms of appropriation. While its dour tone becomes a bit relentless, it is admirably consistent and shows artists grappling with reality, which has its own kind of comfort. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Smith)  P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'THE GOLD STANDARD' Gold is both color and subject in this glittering, pertinent show, installed on creamy yellow walls. Even though a generally dim view of contemporary society prevails, it is scary how good gold makes everything look. (See above.) Closes on Monday (Smith)  Sigmar Polke Painting is man's oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show, new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The show simulates a Wunderkammer, a darkened wonder cabinet of the 17th or 18th century. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, www.michaelwerner.net; closes tomorrow (Kimmelman)  Queens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once' . The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as of Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The show tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video ''Everyday,'' which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Martha Schwendener)",

            "fulltext": "''NEW YORK CITY is beautiful!''  Br\u00edan F. O'Byrne had just come down off the high of a 12-minute helicopter ride above Manhattan and gave it an exuberant review, using a common expletive to modify ''beautiful.'' Mr. O'Byrne, a Tony Award winner and a four-time nominee, is starring in Tom Stoppard's marathon of a play at Lincoln Center, ''The Coast of Utopia,'' about voluble Russian philosophers. On this night, Mr. O'Byrne had taken his dressing-room partner and colleague, Jason Butler Harner, who plays the novelist Ivan Turgenev, on an aerial tour of the city, courtesy of a Christmas gift certificate. ''The way the city blocks look with the lights, just gorgeous,'' Mr. O'Byrne said, with the expletive preceding ''gorgeous.'' (Mr. O'Byrne uses that word so often, some of his quotations here are the equivalent of the A&E version of ''The Sopranos.'')  It was Monday, the actors' requisite day off. Sort of. Mr. O'Byrne (whose first name is pronounced BREE-in) had recorded a voice-over as Alexander Hamilton for a PBS special. He kept insisting he should have been home in Queens memorizing lines. The first two parts of ''The Coast of Utopia'' are running in repertory, while the third part of the trilogy begins previews on Tuesday.  The friends headed to dinner in the theater district at Angus McIndoe, where Mr. McIndoe joined them. Mr. McIndoe, a Scot, and Mr. O'Byrne, an Irishman, go back a decade. Not to be outdone, Mr. Harner insisted he was part Welsh, which he learned reading a book of names.  A book! Both actors lamented how little time they have to read anything not Russian-related. Mr. O'Byrne again fretted about not being home memorizing. Adding stress was the thought that Mr. Stoppard might be writing another scene for him.  Over beet and goat-cheese salad and juicy mussels, the three mocked and cajoled. The two actors rib each other like brothers and finish each other's sentences like lovers, though they are neither. Mr. O'Byrne has a girlfriend in Los Angeles and Mr. Harner is single. Mr. McIndoe, also single, pulled out a picture of his half-Scottish, half-Chinese son.  ''I thought your ex-wife is Japanese?'' Mr. O'Byrne said, sounding serious.  ''Oh, you're right, I must be wrong,'' Mr. McIndoe said gamely.  The discussion turned to reviews; Mr. O'Byrne reads them all. ''You learn from them,'' he said. He talked of performing in ''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' in Galway. One night, a stranger at a pub recognized him from the play and Mr. O'Byrne asked his opinion of it. When the stranger gave a dead-on assessment of the production's shortcomings, Mr. O'Byrne introduced him to the director, Garry Hynes. They followed the stranger's advice and everything ''clicked into place,'' as Mr. O'Byrne put it. The icing on the cake? The guy later married the girl from the box office.  More war stories followed:  ''I heard about a play at the Abbey, where a doctor stood up in the middle and said: 'I'm a doctor. Is there an actor in the house?' '' Mr. O'Byrne said.  Coffee arrived. Mr. O'Byrne checked his voice mail. Mr. Stoppard had called: he'd finished the scene. History in the making.  The bartender played Keane. Mr. McIndoe and Mr. O'Byrne gushed: ''What a great band.''  Soon, Mr. O'Byrne checked his watch. ''One a.m.! I have to get home.''  Back to Queens he went, to sleep, perchance to dream. Or, to stay up all night, perchance to memorize.",

            "fulltext": "The block of Williamsburg's North Sixth Street between Kent and Wythe Avenues has long been a sort of street-art gallery. Not long ago, a life-size head and torso of the children's character Waldo perked up a corrugated-metal fence there, for instance, and beside it was a delicate mauve drawing of a sword-wielding woman with flowers for eyes. The caption read, ''Flower Face Killah: Fierce Warrior.''  Neighbors knew that the block had arrived last summer when a work appeared by the well-known but shadowy British artist known as Banksy. In the stenciled drawing, a girl jumped rope on one side of a door and a boy reached for an electrical switch on the other. One end of the girl's jump rope, a line of neon-green paint, ran across the pavement, up the wall and into the switch.  ''On weekends, it's amazing how many people would come by to see that piece,'' said Norman Rabinovich, 29, a graphic designer who works in the building that served as Banksy's canvas. ''There were tour groups coming by.''  But no longer. Last week, Waldo had been half covered by a drippy mass of teal paint, as had some tongue-in-cheek takeoffs of '50s comic book covers. The Banksy stencils were obscured by gray paint.  ''Art: the Excrement of Action,'' proclaimed a typed flier pasted nearby. After two Nietzschean paragraphs, the flier concluded: ''The passion for destruction is a creative passion. We are all capable of manifesting our desires directly, free of representation and commodification. We will continue manifesting ours by euthanizing your bourgeois fad.''  Whoever defaced the art on North Sixth has been splashing paint on urban artworks in the city for more than a year. The vandal (or vandals) often leaves fliers, sometimes barbed with broken glass, that attack art as decadent or accuse street artists of ''selling out.'' (The paint-splashing on North Sixth Street was first reported on imnotsayin.blogspot.com, a Williamsburg blog.)  Those who make and follow street art accept that well-loved works eventually disappear. But many expressed irritation at the recent wave of vandalism.  ''I don't mind destruction, I don't mind debate, but I do mind something that comes off as being intellectual but is actually simplistic and juvenile,'' said Marc Schiller, whose Web site, Wooster Collective, documents street art. Someone, probably the North Sixth Street vandal, splashed paint on the exterior of a NoLIta building where Mr. Schiller had helped organize a street-art exhibition last month, and Mr. Schiller said that he had become wary of giving the locations of artworks on his Web site. ''Why give someone a road map?'' he said.  Many street artists were reluctant to speak publicly about the destruction, for fear of gratifying the vandal. Patrick Miller, a member of a three-person collective known as Faile, said that the Banksy piece had been splashed with yellow paint, but that he and others had covered it with a coat of gray to deny the vandal attention. Mr. Miller, whose work has also been splashed, said his group would try to incorporate the splashes into its art.  ''We're going to start co-opting it and just embracing it,'' he said.

            "fulltext": "WHEN Barbara Winston had a stone replica of a Mayan temple built in her backyard, it was meant to give her a sense of peace.  Instead, it started a war.  In August 2005, Mrs. Winston, who lives on a 13-acre estate with her husband, Bruce, had a stonecutter erect a $25,000 replica of Guatemala's Temple of the Great Jaguar at the rear of their property. While the temple's scale is one-seventeenth of the original, it is by no means small, with granite blocks forming three staircases rising nine feet to a rectangular platform.  It is also 24 feet from the horse barn and riding ring of the Winstons' neighbor, Diane Lewis, who complained to the Town of Bedford that the temple detracted from the enjoyment of her property.  In September, the Zoning Board of Appeals rejected the Winstons' request for a variance and said that the temple was a structure requiring permits and a 50-foot setback from adjacent property. It questioned why the Winstons, with 13 acres to choose from, put the temple so close to Ms. Lewis's property.  The ruling left the Winstons with three choices: tear down the temple, move it, or fight. In October, they sued the board in state court.  ''I swear to you, I will chain myself to it,'' Mrs. Winston said recently. ''I love her. I'm not moving one stone.''  She said the temple, which she calls ''Tikalita'' -- Tikal was a legendary Mayan city -- was built for spiritual comfort after the recent deaths of her father and sister, and was placed at the back of the property to catch the sunlight. Moving it would destroy it, she said.  In their lawsuit, the Winstons argue that the temple was not a structure as defined in the ordinance. Even if it were, they said, the town should grant the variance because of the temple's spiritual significance.  Joel Sachs, the town attorney, said the temple clearly met the definition of a structure. In a letter to the board, he wrote that the Winstons' claims that it was infringing on their right to religious expression was ''a sham.'' Even churches must meet zoning requirements, Mr. Sachs said.  If the Winstons lose their case, they would face a $250 fine, and the fine could grow if they fail to take down the sculpture.  Mrs. Winston said she and her husband, the son of the jewelry magnate Harry Winston, were mystified by the board's unwillingness to compromise. The Winstons have planted dozens of spruce trees to block the view from Ms. Lewis's property.  Mrs. Winston said that before building the temple, she had no problems with Ms. Lewis and never complained when Ms. Lewis had several trees chopped down to build the horse barn. Records show that around the time the temple was built, Mrs. Winston called the building inspector's office, complaining that the barn smelled and that riding lessons were being given there.  Ms. Lewis could not be reached. Her phone number is unpublished.  Reactions to the temple were mixed among several people here on a recent afternoon.  Kathryn Phelps-Summers, who has lived in Katonah for 37 years, said that, at the least, the Winstons should have informed Ms. Lewis before starting construction.  ''It all boils down to being a good neighbor,'' she said.  Eunice Lawson, a resident of nearby Brewster who works in a Katonah art gallery, said the town was wasting time and money.  ''There are other issues to deal with,'' she said. ''Get a life.''  ZONING",

It is built like, and looks like, a fortress; it can -- and did -- sleep 300; and it contains an apartment fit for a commodore. Its large common area has hardwood floors but is perfect for parking tanks, storing ammunition and conducting military drills. For a starting bid of $800,000, the old armory here is available.  Built in 1894, the New Jersey National Guard Armory, former home to the state's Second Regiment, was abandoned by the military more than 40 years ago. It is now for sale by the City of Paterson, which is looking for a buyer who will preserve the historic building, with its intricate masonry and rich history.  ''It's tough, because what can you really do with an armory?'' Mayor Jos\u00e9 Torres said.  The city's deadline for bids ended Jan. 11, and the mayor says a commission is assessing the four offers that were submitted. He said he had originally hoped the Paterson School District would buy the property and turn it into a much-needed recreation area.  But the district, plagued with financial concerns and bound by oversight from the state, said it could not take on the building.  So Mr. Torres, intent on keeping the building intact rather than being demolished and sold for scrap (''People like to build mansions with these old bricks,'' he said) is hopeful that one of the bids will suit everyone's needs. The city did not identify the bidders, but Mr. Torres said one was interested in using the armory for sporting events and other activities and another wanted it as a site for a business.  A recent tour of the building showed that it is in need of significant repair. There is a thin layer of feathers and pigeon waste in the great hall, from birds that roost on the giant steel beams and the sills of boarded windows. There is a potential asbestos problem and no sprinkler system. The electrical system is shot, and the floors on the second level crack and buckle underfoot.  ''It's a real challenge,'' Mr. Torres said. ''We need someone with deep pockets.''  The city took over the property several years ago after the armory's owner, a private citizen who used it to store military memorabilia, had failed to pay property taxes for several years.  Mr. Torres said the sale of the armory, along with nine other vacant lots or abandoned buildings throughout the city, would add about $8 million to the city coffers. He said he hoped to have a decision on the building's fate by the end of this month.  There once were more than 100 National Guard facilities around the state, but only 34 remain. While some of the decommissioned armories have been demolished, others have become space for movie sets and storage, turned into community centers, or, like the former armory in East Orange, converted into mosques.  Joe Bilby, assistant curator of the National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey in Sea Girt, said the Paterson armory was among the oldest in the state, with most having been built between 1890 and 1920.  ''Before that, the buildings weren't made to last and often the ammunition was stored in city halls,'' he said. ''These buildings can last.''  Soldiers based at the Paterson Armory saw combat during the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II, Mr. Bilby said. He said a unit descended from the old Second Infantry had been there as late as 1956.  Mayor Torres, a lifelong Paterson resident, said he remembered attending the circus, concerts and boxing matches at the armory in his youth. He said he hoped that the building -- with its castlelike entrance, wide staircases, steel arches and expert masonry -- could regain some of its former glory and help the city with redevelopment.

Petraeus as the top American military commander in Iraq, part of a broad revamping of the military team that will carry out the administration's new Iraq strategy, administration officials said Thursday.  In addition to the promotion of General Petraeus, who will replace Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the choice to succeed Gen. John P. Abizaid as the head of the Central Command is expected to be Adm. William J. Fallon, who is the top American military officer in the Pacific, officials said.  The changes are being made as the White House is considering an option to increase American combat power in Baghdad by five brigades as well as adding two battalions of reinforcements to the volatile province of Anbar in western Iraq.  Mr. Bush, who said Thursday that he would present details of his overall strategy for Iraq next week, and several top aides held a video teleconference on Thursday, speaking with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq and his top deputies about plans to add forces in the capital and other matters. The session lasted roughly an hour and 45 minutes.  ''I said that 'You show the will, we will help you,' '' Mr. Bush told reporters.  Echoing the comments of both military and political advisers in recent weeks, he added, ''One thing is for certain: I will want to make sure that the mission is clear and specific and can be accomplished.''  Senior administration officials said that the choice of General Petraeus was part of a broader effort to change almost all of the top American officials in Iraq as Mr. Bush changes his strategy there.  ''The idea is to put the whole new team in at roughly the same time, and send some clear messages that we are trying a new approach,'' a senior administration official said Thursday.  In addition to the military changes, Mr. Bush intends to appoint the ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, as the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, a senior administration official said Thursday.  ''It was clearly time to move the players around on the field,'' said the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Mr. Bush had yet to announce the changes. ''This helps the president to make the case that this is a fresh start.''  Admiral Fallon would be the first Navy officer to serve as the senior officer of the Central Command, which is managing simultaneous ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Admiral Fallon is regarded within the military as one of its stronger regional combat commanders, and his possible appointment also reflects a greater emphasis on countering Iranian power, a mission that relies heavily on naval forces and combat airpower to project American influence in the Persian Gulf.  General Petraeus, who is now the head of the Army's Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., helped oversee the drafting of the military's comprehensive new manual on counterinsurgency. He has served two previous tours in Iraq, and some former officers say he sees the need for additional troops in Baghdad.  He will replace General Casey, whose plan for troop reductions in Iraq faltered last year in the face of escalating sectarian strife and who initially expressed public wariness about any short-term increase in troops in Iraq, a move that is now a leading option under consideration by the White House.  The departures of both General Casey and General Abizaid were expected, though in General Casey's case it appears to have been moved up several months from the originally anticipated shift in spring or summer. General Abizaid's tour had already been extended for a full year beyond the typical two-year stint, and he has announced that he will retire soon.  The troop increase option under discussion would focus on improving security in Baghdad. Under this approach, two Army combat brigades would be sent to the capital during the first phase of the operation. A combat brigade generally consists of about 3,500 soldiers. At the same time, a third brigade would be positioned in Kuwait as a reserve, and two more brigades would be on call in the United States.  The expectation is that these three brigades would eventually be sent to Baghdad as well, though the president would have the option to limit the reinforcements. Part of the increase could be achieved by holding some units past their currently scheduled return home.  Scaling up by five brigades would more than double the number of American combat troops involved in security operations in the Iraqi capital. The emphasis on Baghdad reflects the view that stability in the capital is a precondition for any broader effort to bring calm to the whole country. It is also a recognition that the administration sees sectarian violence as a greater threat to Iraq's stability than the Sunni Arab insurgency.  While Baghdad is the principal focus, the option also provides for sending two battalions of reinforcements to Anbar, where overstretched Marine and Army forces have been battling Sunni Arab insurgents. A basic battalion generally consists of 1,200 troops.  One issue under discussion is how to mesh the emerging American strategy with the Iraqis' capabilities. Bush administration officials say they want the increase in American troops to be paralleled by a considerable rise in the number of functional Iraqi troops. But the Iraqis failed in the summer to send all the reinforcements that had been requested, and some Iraqi security forces, particularly the police, have been infiltrated by militias.  Another point of contention is that some senior aides to Mr. Maliki have been notably unenthusiastic about an increase in American troops in Baghdad. During his meeting with Mr. Bush in Jordan in November, Mr. Maliki presented a plan that would shift most Americans to the periphery of Baghdad so they could concentrate on fighting Sunni insurgents while the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government asserted more control over the capital. That has left some American officials wondering whether the Maliki government was making a legitimate bid to exercise sovereignty or is committed to a sectarian Shiite agenda.  Bush administration officials believe that their new Iraqi strategy must involve political steps toward reconciliation and reconstruction programs to produce jobs.  In their teleconference, Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki discussed the Iraqi government's efforts at political reconciliation and the Iraqi prime minister's vows to rein in militias, the pace of which American officials have found painfully slow. Discussing the execution of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush said the Maliki government was right to investigate the circumstances surrounding the hanging.  General Petraeus participated in the initial invasion of Iraq as the commander of the 101st Airborne Division. The division fought its way toward Baghdad and was later sent to Mosul in northern Iraq, where the general focused on political and economic reconstruction efforts.  ''We are in a race to win over the people,'' read a sign in his Mosul headquarters. ''What have you and your element done today to contribute to victory?''  General Petraeus did a second tour in Iraq in which he oversaw the efforts to train the Iraqi Army. At his current post at Fort Leavenworth, he has been involved in the push to change the United States Army's training and education to emphasize counterinsurgency operations.  Jack Keane, the retired Army general who served as vice chief of the Army, called General Petraeus an ''imaginative commander who is experienced and knows how to deal with irregular warfare,'' as the Army refers to insurgencies.  The Iraq commander post is considered a four-star general's command, a promotion that would add a star to General Petraeus's shoulder.  Officials also said Admiral Fallon received a persuasive recommendation from the Joint Chiefs as one of the military's stronger commanders of a geographic theater, with his current command including the challenges of North Korea and China.  In that capacity, he also took the unusual and punitive move in December of canceling a large, annual field exercise with the Philippines over a local judge's failure to honor the bilateral treaty governing protections for American military personnel. The judge refused to honor the agreement's rule that American military personnel remain in American custody pending final appeal of all criminal proceedings against them, and ordered a marine convicted of rape held in a local jail even though the case was on appeal.

The new plan focuses on stabilizing Baghdad by adding thousands of American troops with newly expanded powers to take on Shiite as well as Sunni rebels. It also includes a limited increase in United States forces in Anbar Province, and calls for Iraqi forces to take formal control of the security mission in November. The president was refreshingly candid, saying that ''where mistakes have been made, the responsibility rests with me.''  But taken as a whole, the speech raised more questions than it answered.

            "fulltext": "Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, President Bush's new choice as the top commander in Iraq, told senators on Tuesday that the new military strategy to secure Baghdad can work, and that he had asked that the additional troops the administration promised be deployed as quickly as possible.  In his first public comments about Mr. Bush's plan to send some 21,500 troops, the general described the situation in Iraq as ''dire'' but not hopeless. He asserted that the ''persistent presence'' of American and Iraqi forces in strife-ridden Baghdad neighborhoods was a necessary step, but also cautioned that the mission would not succeed if the Iraqi government did not carry out its program of political reconciliation.  ''The way ahead will be neither quick nor easy, and undoubtedly there will be tough days,'' he told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ''We face a determined, adaptable, barbaric enemy. He will try to wait us out. In fact any such endeavor is a test of wills, and there are no guarantees.''  But much of the hearing focused not on details of the strategy about to unfold in Iraq, but rather on the political debate within the Senate over resolutions that would signal disapproval of the new strategy.  When Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has long favored sending more troops to Iraq, asked if approval of a Senate resolution assailing Mr. Bush's new strategy could hurt the morale of American troops, the general replied, ''It would not be a beneficial effect, sir.''  Asked by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who also backs the plan, if a resolution would also ''give the enemy some encouragement'' by suggesting that the American people are divided, General Petraeus replied, ''That's correct, sir.''  That answer sparked admonishments by critics of Mr. Bush's strategy, who insisted that the point of the Senate resolutions is to put pressure on the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq to follow through on its political program and take more responsibility for its own security.  ''We know this policy is going forward,'' said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York. ''We know the troops are moving. We know that we're not likely to stop this escalation. But we are going to do everything we can to send a message to our government and the Iraqi government that they had better change, because the enemy we are confronting is adaptable.''  Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is promoting a resolution opposing Mr. Bush's troop reinforcement plan, cautioned General Petraeus to be sure that ''this colloquy has not entrapped you into some responses that you might later regret.''  By the end of the hearing, General Petraeus sought to extricate himself from the political tussle by insisting that as a military man he did not want to take a position on the Senate debate. ''There are a number of resolutions out there,'' he said. ''Learning that minefields are best avoided and gone around rather than walked through on some occasions, I'd like to leave that one there.''  Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the Democratic chairman of the panel, said later that he was satisfied that the general had not intended to involve himself in the debate. The exchanges at the hearing did not appear to have any ill effect on the prospects for the confirmation of General Petraeus, and Mr. McCain said he hoped the commander would ''catch the next flight'' to Iraq after winning Senate confirmation.  When their questions focused on the military plan, senators elicited several new details. General Petraeus said Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the day-to-day commander of American troops in Iraq, advised that in order to carry out the new strategy, five additional brigades were needed in Baghdad and two additional battalions were needed in Anbar Province in western Iraq.  Under the current deployment schedule, it will be May before all five of the brigades are in Iraq, but General Petraeus hinted that he would like them sooner, saying that he had asked the Pentagon to dispatch them ''as rapidly as possible.''  General Petraeus acknowledged that the guidelines in the military's counterinsurgency manual implied that 120,000 troops would be needed to secure Baghdad. But he reasoned that the roughly 32,000 American troops that would be deployed in the capital under the plan would be enough, because the total number of American and Iraqi security personnel would be about 85,000, while the use of civilian contractors to guard government buildings would reduce troop requirements.  If the troops are sent according to the current schedule, General Petraeus said the United States would know by late summer if the plan to clear contested neighborhoods of insurgents and militias, hold them with American and Iraqi security forces and win public support through reconstruction was working.  He said he would raise the issue of suspending troop reinforcements with his military superiors if the Iraqi government appeared to have not lived up to its commitments. But he suggested that withholding assistance from specific Iraqi institutions that fall short would have a greater influence. The general also said that a decision to withdraw American troops within six months would lead to more sectarian attacks and increased ''ethnic cleansing.''  General Petraeus acknowledged that he had concerns about the absence of a unified command structure. Under the new plan, the Iraqi Army and police units will be under direct Iraqi command. The American Army units that work with them will be under a parallel American command. To ensure proper coordination, American officers are trying to establish joint command posts.  Senator Levin said his committee had repeatedly asked the administration to make available a list of the security and political ''benchmarks'' the Iraqi had agreed to meet. He warned that the committee would use its subpoena power or hold up military nominations if benchmarks were not provided.  By insisting on that the benchmarks be provided, Mr. Levin seemed to be trying to position himself to argue that the ''surge'' of reinforcements be suspended if the Iraqis fell short of meeting commitments.

            "fulltext": "Even before the November elections, President Bush and his national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, were informally discussing what Mr. Hadley was calling ''the big push'' -- whether it made sense to make a show of increased American force in Baghdad to take back the city.  But when Mr. Hadley traveled to Iraq in late October, the commander there, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., repeated his frequent warning that to send more troops to Iraq could be counterproductive, because it might make the Iraqi government less likely to defend itself. By the time Mr. Bush met Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki in Jordan on Nov. 30, Mr. Maliki was insisting upon taking control over all Iraqi troops and urging the Americans to withdraw to the outskirts of his capital.  Over the past two months those diametrically opposed options -- adding American troops, or pulling back to let the Iraqi factions fight it out -- marked the boundaries of a vigorous debate inside the Bush administration. At one point, as Mr. Bush, Mr. Hadley, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the newly appointed secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, weighed their options, the president asked his deputies, in effect: ''Why can't we just pull out of Baghdad and let the factions fight it out themselves?''  Ultimately, the president and his advisers came back to the idea of adding American troops -- the new approach they concluded was the best of a series of difficult choices, according to a senior administration official involved in the process.  A narrative pieced together from interviews with participants and from public testimony suggests that through much of the process, generals who had been on the ground in Iraq during the past year had favored that the new strategy begin with a substantially smaller force than the one that President Bush announced to the nation on Wednesday night. In the end, it was Mr. Bush who appeared to drive his commanders along to the conclusion that more troops were needed.  In an appearance before Congress on Thursday, Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed that General Casey had requested only two new American brigades, about 9,000 troops, for Baghdad, along with three Iraqi brigades. The White House gave him five brigades. Gen. John P. Abizaid, who heads the Central Command, was opposed to any increase in American troop levels until mid-November, when he became convinced that the economic commitments by both Iraq and the United States made it worth adding troops.  White House officials were clearly sensitive on Thursday about any suggestions that the president countermanded his generals, and said his new plan had their full support. They said the generals sought and received assurances that the Iraqis would undertake political initiatives and end the practice of releasing militia figures who were friends of the government and captured by American or Iraqi forces.  In public comments before the elections, Mr. Bush resisted calls for troop increases from some of his own supporters, saying his generals saw no such need. During an interview session with conservative columnists in September, Mr. Bush said: ''If General Casey feels like he needs more troops, we'll send them,'' according to a transcript posted by The National Review. Asked by an interviewer, ''What if he's wrong?'' Mr. Bush shot back, ''Then I picked the wrong general.''  Still far ahead of Election Day, Mr. Bush had decided to oust Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Rumsfeld was seen by people inside and outside the administration as opposed to a major change. ''It was clear Rumsfeld was committed to the strategy that he had employed from the beginning,'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said. Several officials inside and outside the administration said Mr. Rumsfeld's departure on Nov. 8 helped to empower Mr. Hadley, along with his deputy at the National Security Council, Jack D. Crouch, as they ran the review process inside the White House. Both said they considered many options. But Mr. Hadley was clearly focused on troop levels early on, suggesting in a Nov. 8 memorandum that the president should ask the Pentagon and General Casey to recommend whether more forces were needed in Baghdad.  Mr. Hadley believed from the start of the review that the administration's approach through much of 2006 -- that political reconciliation would lead to stability -- was not working. ''You have this Catch-22 element,'' Mr. Hadley said in a conversation in his office before he took his late-October trip to Baghdad. ''You can't have security without political and economic progress, but it's hard to have political and economic progress without security.''  One senior official involved in the discussions said that Mr. Bush's instinct toward the start of the review process -- and that of others -- was to consider a withdrawal from Baghdad, allow Iraqi-vs.-Iraqi fighting to settle itself, and dedicate United States forces to focus on pursuing Qaeda fighters. ''As you peel that back and look at it, it just doesn't war-game out for you,'' said the official. ''You're supposed to go flying through Baghdad looking for Al Qaeda, and when you see ethnic cleansing going on look the other way?''  In the end, the official said, Mr. Hadley's teams concluded that an American withdrawal from Baghdad would ''crater the government.''  Another option discussed was to try to steer the Iraqi government toward a political realignment that would essentially depose Mr. Maliki, and put a stronger figure in place. By elimination, those discussions led Mr. Bush's top advisers back to the idea of a troop increase. According to an account by one senior official, General Pace traveled to Crawford, Tex., to meet with Mr. Bush after Christmas and took with him a recommendation calling for two more American brigades in Baghdad, with three more American brigades on call, along with two additional American battalions for Anbar.  According to a senior administration official, Vice President Dick Cheney was among those who wanted a bigger force. Ultimately, Mr. Bush concluded that General Pace's initial request was too small and should be augmented by three more American brigades for Baghdad. General Pace said that General Abizaid, who is retiring this year, had opposed the idea of a troop increase. But General Abizaid came around, General Pace said, when he saw that the additional American combat forces would be accompanied by a ''political and economic surge.''  THE REACH OF WAR",

            "fulltext": "President Bush intends to name Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born diplomat who has been ambassador to Iraq for the past 21 months, to be the new envoy to the United Nations, part of a diplomatic shakeup as Mr. Bush prepares to announce a new strategy for the war.  A senior administration official, who had been briefed on the decision but had to discuss it anonymously because the change had not been formally announced, confirmed Thursday that the president had decided to nominate Mr. Khalilzad to the United Nations post.  The official said Mr. Bush intended to name Ryan C. Crocker, the ambassador to Pakistan, to replace Mr. Khalilzad in Baghdad.  If confirmed by the Senate, the appointments would put seasoned, respected diplomats into two of the State Department's most challenging posts. Mr. Khalilzad would replace John R. Bolton, who served temporarily as United Nations ambassador but resigned late last year after concluding he could not win Senate confirmation.  Mr. Bush's decision to transfer Mr. Khalilzad, among the most visible Americans working in Iraq, would effectively accomplish two goals for the administration. As a Sunni Muslim, Mr. Khalilzad has been perceived by some Iraqi Shiites as not sympathetic enough to their views; removing him from Baghdad would help Mr. Bush make a fresh start there. And Mr. Khalilzad had told colleagues that he was ready to leave.  The change also would give the United States the strong voice it needs at the United Nations, particularly after the storm surrounding Mr. Bolton.  The senior administration official said the White House believed that Mr. Khalilzad, as a Muslim who had extensive experience overseas including a stint as ambassador to his native Afghanistan, would bring an important understanding of the Muslim world to his work at the United Nations.  Daniel P. Serwer, the executive director of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which recently issued a report recommending a new strategy for Iraq, said a Khalilzad nomination would send a message ''that we are taking the U.N. seriously and sending somebody who has real weight with this administration, and who has served in our toughest post.''  But Leon E. Panetta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who was one of five Democrats on the study group, said he feared removing Mr. Khalilzad from Baghdad would leave ''a vacuum'' there at a critical time.  ''The problem we've had in Iraq is that the people who finally get to understand how that country works suddenly leave,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''He's probably a pretty good appointment for the U.N., but you do have to be nervous about who is going to speak for us in Iraq.''  But some in the administration have suggested that perhaps Mr. Khalilzad has been too prominent a figure in Iraq.  In a classified memorandum written Nov. 8 after visiting Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki in Baghdad, President Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said that the president might urge Mr. Khalilzad, who goes by the nickname Zal, to take a lower profile as one way to buttress the Maliki government.  Under the heading ''What we can do to help Maliki,'' Mr. Hadley ticked off a list of suggestions, among them: ''Encourage Zal to move into the background and let Maliki take more credit for positive developments. (We want Maliki to exert his authority -- and demonstrate to Iraqis that he is a strong leader -- by taking action against extremists, not by pushing back on the United States and the Coalition.)''  Unlike the other changes to Mr. Bush's foreign policy team in the last 24 hours, which caught much of Washington off guard, the moves involving Mr. Khalilzad and Mr. Crocker have been the subject of speculation here for weeks, since Mr. Bolton resigned on Dec. 5.  By that time Mr. Khalilzad had already told colleagues that he was ready to for a change of assignment. ABC News first reported the decision about Mr. Khalilzad on its Web site on Thursday afternoon.  Educated in Beirut and the United States (he holds a doctorate from the University of Chicago), the blunt-spoken Mr. Khalilzad, 55, has been a prominent figure in American foreign policy circles since the Reagan administration, when he advised the State Department on the Iran-Iraq war and the Soviet war in Afghanistan.  He later joined the administration of the first President Bush, where he earned a reputation as a hawk who called for the ouster of Saddam Hussein, advice that administration did not take. More recently, senior administration officials say, he was considered for the No. 2 State Department job that John D. Negroponte is expected to take.  Mr. Crocker, 57, has been a Foreign Service officer since 1971 and is among the State Department's most respected voices in the Middle East. He has been ambassador to Pakistan since 2004, and has served as ambassador to Syria, Kuwait and Lebanon.",

            "fulltext": "John D. Negroponte, whom President Bush installed less than two years ago as the first director of national intelligence, will soon leave his post to become the State Department's second-ranking official, administration officials said Wednesday.  Mr. Negroponte will fill a critical job that has been vacant for months, and he is expected to play a leading role in shaping policy in Iraq. But his transfer is another blow to an intelligence community that has seen little continuity at the top since the departure of George J. Tenet in 2004 as director of central intelligence.  Mr. Negroponte had been brought to the intelligence job to help restore credibility and effectiveness to agencies whose reputations were badly damaged by failures related to the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and mistaken prewar assessments of Iraq's illicit weapons. He has maintained a low public profile but provides Mr. Bush with a briefing most mornings.  President Bush has hailed the establishment of the intelligence post as an essential step in helping prevent another terrorist attack. On paper, the director of national intelligence outranks the deputy secretary of state, raising questions about why the White House would seek -- and why Mr. Negroponte would agree to -- the shift.  The move, expected to be announced this week, comes as the president prepares to announce a new strategy for Iraq as sectarian violence worsens there and approval ratings sag at home.  The administration has had great difficulty filling the State Department position. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has asked several people who have turned down the post, according to senior State Department officials.  But administration officials interviewed on Wednesday would not say whether Mr. Negroponte was moving because the White House saw him as uniquely qualified for the diplomatic post, or because President Bush was dissatisfied with his performance as intelligence chief, or whether it was a combination of the two.  Mr. Negroponte has served as ambassador to the United Nations and to Iraq, and administration officials say Ms. Rice was trying to recruit him to bring more Iraq expertise to her office.  Administration officials from two different agencies said Wednesday that the leading candidate to become the new intelligence chief is J. Michael McConnell, a retired vice admiral who led the National Security Agency from 1992 to 1996. Admiral McConnell was head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Gen. Colin L. Powell during the first Persian Gulf war, in 1991.  Mr. Bush had at first been reluctant to set up the intelligence post, but ultimately bowed to Congressional pressure and made the office a cabinet-level position.  As deputy secretary of state, Mr. Negroponte, who would need Senate confirmation for the post, would fill a pivotal foreign policy position that has been vacant since Robert B. Zoellick resigned to take a post at Goldman Sachs.  The shift of Mr. Negroponte, first reported Wednesday evening by NBC News, reflects a further transformation in President Bush's foreign policy team that has already seen Robert M. Gates take over as defense secretary from Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Bush still has other top posts to fill, including that of ambassador to the United Nations, left vacant with the departure of John R. Bolton.  Mr. Negroponte would move to the State Department as the administration is preparing a shift in Iraq strategy.  As a career diplomat who also served as ambassador to Mexico, the Philippines and Honduras, Mr. Negroponte brought a policy maker's perspective to the role of intelligence chief, a post established by Congress at the end of 2004 to address a lack of coordination among intelligence agencies. He took over the job in April 2005, and said in an interview on C-Span last month that he expected to stay in his position until the end of the Bush administration.  Admiral McConnell is a career intelligence officer who is a senior vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, an international consulting firm. During his tenure at the Pentagon and as director of the National Security Agency, Admiral McConnell worked closely with Mr. Gates during Mr. Gates's time as deputy national security adviser and as director of central intelligence, and with Dick Cheney while he was defense secretary during the first Persian Gulf war.  Senator Susan M. Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Senate Government Reform Committee, was a major backer of the intelligence post, and on Wednesday she said of the reported transfer: ''The director of national intelligence is an absolutely critical position. I'm disappointed that Negroponte would leave this critical position when it's still in its infancy. There are a number of people who could ably serve as deputy secretary of state, but few who can handle the challenges of chief of intelligence.''  Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat who also pressed for establishment of the intelligence job, said: ''I'm worrying that our deficit in intelligence will not be corrected. I'm sorry Negroponte isn't completing his term because he at least understood intelligence.''  Mr. Negroponte's move to the State Department has been rumored for months. Ms. Rice was pushing to bring Mr. Negroponte in as her deputy, and officials in Washington speculated that the career diplomat might be more comfortable returning to the State Department.  The White House press secretary, Tony Snow, declined to comment on the change. ''We don't comment on personnel matters until the president has announced his intentions,'' Mr. Snow said in an e-mail message Wednesday night.  Officials said one priority in replacing Mr. Negroponte had been to select someone who could pass swiftly through the Senate confirmation process. They also cautioned that the choice of Admiral McConnell was not final.  The job of deputy director of national intelligence is also vacant, and the White House is conscious that a long nomination battle in the Senate, where Democrats are now in the majority, could throw the intelligence office into disarray.

But the reported return to the foreign policy fold of this former ambassador to Baghdad, and, before that, to the United Nations, has a certain logic to it.  The diplomacy-challenged Bush administration could surely use the help. We hope that Mr. Negroponte can provide Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with the intellectual and bureaucratic reinforcement she so desperately needs to help guide the administration to a wiser course on Iraq.  Mr. Negroponte certainly has experience. In a 40-plus-year career -- including an early stint as a political officer in Vietnam -- he has also served as ambassador to Honduras (during Ronald Reagan's contra war), Mexico and the Philippines. He is known as a canny, and sometimes ruthless, bureaucratic player. What he doesn't have, unfortunately, is much of a reputation for challenging the unwise policy presumptions of his bosses.  In his 10 months in Baghdad from mid-2004 to mid-2005, Mr. Negroponte undoubtedly saw the yawning gap between Iraq's grim reality and the delusional claims of success issuing from Washington. While President Bush and other top officials trumpeted effective military training programs, a flowering Iraqi democracy and an insurgency ever on its last legs, anyone on the ground had to see paper Iraqi battalions, the rise of sectarian militias and ever-expanding chaos.  If Mr. Negroponte made a serious effort to jolt his bosses back to the real world, there is no public record of it. That will have to change if he is to have any chance of improving things. Before confirming him, the Senate should make sure he understands that asking hard and unwelcome questions is an essential part of the job.  Mr. Negroponte's switch will mean another wrenching shift in the top ranks of America's deeply troubled intelligence agencies. One of the main problems that the national intelligence director's job was created to solve was the destructive rivalries between intelligence agencies run by the Defense Department and their civilian counterparts.  That infighting reached a crescendo during the reign of Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. Mr. Rumsfeld's replacement, Robert Gates, a former director of central intelligence, will have the credibility -- and we hope the will -- to calm those rivalries and improve interagency coordination. Even then, Mr. Bush must quickly find a credible replacement for Mr. Negroponte, preferably one who is willing to jolt his bosses with the truth. This administration's record of failures in Iraq is matched only by its failures on intelligence.  Editorial",

            "fulltext": "President Bush told Americans last night that failure in Iraq would be a disaster. The disaster is Mr. Bush's war, and he has already failed. Last night was his chance to stop offering more fog and be honest with the nation, and he did not take it.  Americans needed to hear a clear plan to extricate United States troops from the disaster that Mr. Bush created. What they got was more gauzy talk of victory in the war on terrorism and of creating a ''young democracy'' in Iraq. In other words, a way for this president to run out the clock and leave his mess for the next one.  Mr. Bush did acknowledge that some of his previous tactics had failed. But even then, the president sounded as if he were an accidental tourist in Iraq. He described the failure of last year's effort to pacify Baghdad as if the White House and the Pentagon bore no responsibility.  In any case, Mr. Bush's excuses were tragically inadequate. The nation needs an eyes-wide-open recognition that the only goal left is to get the U.S. military out of this civil war in a way that could minimize the slaughter of Iraqis and reduce the chances that the chaos Mr. Bush unleashed will engulf Iraq's neighbors.  What it certainly did not need were more of Mr. Bush's open-ended threats to Iran and Syria.  Before Mr. Bush spoke, Americans knew he planned to send more troops to pacify lawless Baghdad. Mr. Bush's task was to justify that escalation by acknowledging that there was no military solution to this war and outlining the political mission that the military would be serving. We were waiting for him to detail the specific milestones that he would set for the Iraqis, set clear timelines for when they would be expected to meet them, and explain what he intended to do if they again failed.  Instead, he said he had warned the Iraqis that if they didn't come through, they would lose the faith of the American people. Has Mr. Bush really not noticed that the American people long ago lost faith in the Iraqi government -- and in him as well? Americans know that this Iraqi government is captive to Shiite militias, with no interest in the unity, reconciliation and democracy that Mr. Bush says he wants.  Mr. Bush said yet again that he wanted the Iraqi government to step up to the task of providing its security, and that Iraq needed a law on the fair distribution of oil money. Iraq's government needs to do a lot more than that, starting with disarming the sectarian militias that are feeding the civil war and purging the police forces that too often are really death squads. It needs to offer amnesty to insurgents and militia fighters willing to put down their weapons. It needs to do those things immediately.  Iraq's Shiite-dominated government has heard this list before. But so long as Mr. Bush is willing to back that failed government indefinitely -- enabling is the psychological term -- Iraq's leaders will have no reason to move against the militias and more fairly share power with the Sunni minority.  Mr. Bush did announce his plan for 20,000 more troops, and the White House trumpeted a $1 billion contribution to reconstruction efforts. Congress will debate these as if they are the real issues. But they are not. Talk of a ''surge'' ignores the other 132,000 American troops trapped by a failed strategy.  We have argued that the United States has a moral obligation to stay in Iraq as long as there is a chance to mitigate the damage that a quick withdrawal might cause. We have called for an effort to secure Baghdad, but as part of the sort of comprehensive political solution utterly lacking in Mr. Bush's speech. This war has reached the point that merely prolonging it could make a bad ending even worse. Without a real plan to bring it to a close, there is no point in talking about jobs programs and military offensives. There is nothing ahead but even greater disaster in Iraq.  Editorial",

            "fulltext": "President Bush came to this Georgia military base looking for a friendly audience to sell his new Iraq strategy. But his lunchtime talk received a restrained response from soldiers who clapped politely but showed little of the wild enthusiasm that they ordinarily shower on the commander in chief.  Under the new plan, more than 20,000 additional troops will be sent to Iraq, some from Fort Benning who learned Thursday that they would go earlier than expected. But instead of centering his address on the soldiers' situation, Mr. Bush seemed to be aiming his talk at ordinary Americans and members of Congress who are skeptical of his proposal.  Mr. Bush acknowledged, as he did in his televised address to the nation on Wednesday night, that he had miscalculated the number of troops necessary to execute the military's ''clear, hold and build'' strategy of securing Baghdad neighborhoods and tamping down sectarian violence.  ''What's new about this plan is there will be enough troops to clear, build and hold, and that our troops will be able to move alongside the Iraqis without political interference, and that's very important,'' the president said. He added, ''This is something different that enables the military folks to predict that we will succeed in helping quell sectarian violence in Baghdad.''  Mr. Bush pledged that the strategy would produce a return to peaceful society in Baghdad, but said it would take time. ''The new strategy is not going to yield immediate results, it's going to take a while,'' he said, adding, ''Yet over time, we can expect to see positive results.''  The president was not specific about how long he meant. But a senior official at the National Security Council who helped develop the policy said the administration's target is significant improvement in a year.  ''By the end of this year,'' this official said, ''Baghdad's got to look significantly different. Decisive change in Baghdad is the focus.''  Senior aides to Mr. Bush acknowledge that he is taking a risk in putting his faith in the government of Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Mr. Bush said Thursday that he had been heartened this week by Iraqi and American forces fighting together to root out terrorists on Haifa Street in Baghdad, and that he also was encouraged by Mr. Maliki's recent statements that sectarian violence would not be tolerated.  ''The prime minister and I have had some plain talking,'' the president said. ''I have made it clear that the patience of the American people is not unlimited.''  As Mr. Bush spoke here, two members of his cabinet, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, were testifying about the plan on Capitol Hill, where Democrats are promising a vote on the plan and may go so far as to place limits on financing for the war. Traveling with Mr. Bush to Fort Benning, Dan Bartlett, counselor to the president, warned that if Democrats were going to criticize, they must come up with something better.  ''Those who have decided to judge this plan before it has a chance to work have a greater responsibility to propose something that will work,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''We've yet to see that from the Democrats.''  Soldiers from Fort Benning have already contributed heavily to the Iraq war effort. Members of the Third Infantry Division, Third Brigade, have served two tours in Iraq, and some were notified Thursday that they would serve a third starting in mid-March, about two months ahead of schedule, as a result of the president's plan.  In his speech, Mr. Bush took note of that, saying, ''I appreciate the sacrifices our troops are willing to make.'' But he did not dwell on sacrifice; a senior White House official said the president did not want that to be the major theme of his talk.  It was difficult to know how the soldiers felt about returning to the war zone, or the president's new Iraq plan. Though Mr. Bush's lunch was open to the press, the base commander, Maj. Gen. Walter Wojdakowski, would not let the troops in attendance talk to reporters. His spokeswoman said the commander wanted ''the focus to be on the president.''  THE REACH OF WAR",

            "fulltext": "Added to the Winter X Games 10 years ago as an appeal to youth, skiercross has instead come to be dominated by retired Alpine racers creating a second act to their competitive careers.  A new event for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, skiercross features four or more racers on a downhill course of big jumps, banks and rollers. Often compared to motocross, competitors bump and jostle one another, leading to some spectacular crashes.  At the X Games on Sunday, the sport lived up to its reputation for contact on Buttermilk Mountain's 3,600-foot course. Nine of 24 racers fell -- three were treated at a hospital and released -- beginning with elimination rounds and carrying into a thrilling final. In that race, the Aspen skier Casey Puckett grabbed the lead out of the gate and hung on to win despite a late charge by Jake Fiala of Frisco, Colo.  Coming off the course's last jump, where the snowboardcross racer Lindsey Jacobellis wiped out a day earlier, Fiala made a final push to finish first, but he got his tips up while airborne and went skidding to the snow. His momentum carried him across the finish line, and he wound up with the silver medal.  ''I knew if I went too far to the left, I wouldn't make the landing,'' said Fiala, 31, who competed in Alpine events at the 2002 Olympics. ''I pretty much flew into the fence.''  Puckett, 34, who competed in downhill events at four Olympics from 1992 through 2002, said of Fiala's late push, ''I don't want to put people into the fence, but I'm going to protect my lead.''  Enak Gavaggio, 30, of France finished third, his seventh bronze medal at the Winter X Games. All three women's medalists were French: Ophelie David (gold), Valentine Scuotto (silver) and Meryll Boulangeat (bronze).  The most successful and famous racer in the field was the 33-year-old Daron Rahlves, of Sugarbowl, Calif., who has 28 Alpine World Cup podium appearances in downhill and super-G, including 12 victories. Rahlves retired from Alpine competition after the 2006 Olympics, his third.  Although it was his first Winter X Games, Rahlves was favored to win the gold medal in skiercross after finishing first in qualifying and in each of his quarterfinal and semifinal heats.  But during the final, Rahlves inexplicably lost his balance on an upper portion of the course and went careering sideways off a jump, crashing and losing a ski.  His spill demonstrated how unpredictable skiercross can be.  ''The big thing is,'' Puckett said, ''you can be the fastest skier in the world, which Daron arguably is, and still not win the skiercross.''  Its simplicity and unpredictability led Ron Semiao, the senior vice president of ESPN Original Entertainment and X Games creator, to add the event for the Winter X Games's second season. No skiing events were held during the first Winter X Games in 1997 because the sport was viewed as stale and stodgy compared with snowboarding.  Since its debut at the X Games, skiercross has become a World Cup discipline governed by the International Ski Federation.  But the sport's biggest boost was its inclusion in the next Winter Olympics. Skiercross will be the third X Games event to be added to the Olympics, joining snowboarding halfpipe and snowboardcross.  Later Sunday, with the biggest, most stylish 1080-degree spins, Steve Fischer wound back the clock during the men's superpipe, winning the gold medal.  Fischer, 24, of Breckenridge, Colo., last won X Games gold in 2004 when he was among a select group of riders who pioneered the 1080, a spin of three full rotations. He has since struggled, finishing out of the top 10 at the X Games, and failing to qualify for the 2006 Olympic team.  But in the X Games final, Fischer beat out three American Olympians, including the halfpipe gold medal winner at the Turin Games, Shaun White, who wound up with silver.  ''It's nice to be on top,'' Fischer said. ''This one is great.''  The first of Fischer's three runs turned out to be the winner, with a score of 92. White was second with a 91, and 19-year-old Mason Aguirre of Duluth, Minn., won the bronze with a 90.66.  Since Fischer helped introduce the 1080 three years ago, it has become a requirement for a winning run. All three medal winners included at least two during their routines.  As it turned out, an easier trick undid White.  Because White, 20, of Carlsbad, Calif., finished first in qualifying, he had the last run and a chance to unseat Fischer for gold. He could do no worse than second, but on his final run he landed low on a 540-degree spin known as a McTwist, a relatively midlevel move. On his prior run, White's board struck the deck during a McTwist.  ''I had a sketch, and that's what cost me gold,'' said White, who has not competed in a halfpipe contest since winning the U.S. Open of Snowboarding in March 2006. White has been inundated with commercial opportunities since winning Olympic gold, and he said they have interfered with his riding.  EXTREME SPORTS",

She was 99.  Her death was confirmed by her lawyer, Richard Hatch.  Starting in 1922, Orcutt won more than 65 major tournaments. Her first of 10 Women's Metropolitan Amateur championships came at age 19 and her last, at 61. Her last title of any kind was a club championship in Durham, N.C., when she was 82.  From 1932 to 1938, Orcutt played on the United States team in the first four Curtis Cup matches against British amateurs. She was the runner-up for the United States amateur title in 1927 and 1936.  In her prime, there was no women's professional tour and only a handful of female pros, notably Babe Didriksen Zaharias. Once, when Orcutt beat Zaharias in an exhibition, Zaharias was so upset that she stalked off without paying a $10 bet.  Orcutt also played in exhibitions with the best male professionals. She was barely in her 20s when Walter Hagen, the celebrated pro, arrived in Augusta, Ga., and learned she would be his partner in an exhibition.  ''I would get a lady golfer,'' Hagan said sarcastically. Orcutt overheard him.  ''I didn't say anything,'' she once recalled. ''But the next day, I carried Hagen for nine holes and we won.''  In friendly matches, she hit off the back tees used by men, and with her solid build she usually outdrove them, averaging 240 yards with wood-shaft clubs.  Orcutt was born April 1, 1907, in New York City. Her father was Benjamin Sinclair Orcutt, a Mayflower descendant who was the assistant Sunday editor of The New York Times and later an associate editor of The Wall Street Journal. Her mother was Elizabeth Kelly Orcutt, a prominent golfer.  For their daughter's seventh birthday, they gave her a cutdown hickory-shafted mashie niblick (now called a No. 7 iron). At 12, for the first time, Orcutt counted her strokes for an 18-hole round. She shot 128 (it would be her highest score), but she was hardly dismayed.  A year later, she told her mother, ''If you can be runner-up for the club championship, I can win it.''  Her mother replied: ''You are a fresh brat. If you can beat me, I'll give you my golf clubs and my membership at the club.''  Orcutt borrowed her father's clubs, played her mother and won the match, the clubs and the club membership. Her mother never played golf again.  At Englewood High School in New Jersey, Orcutt started winning golf tournaments and was also captain of the girls' basketball team. In her first year at New York University, she injured a knee in gym class. A doctor advised her to recuperate in the heat of Florida and play golf there. She did and never went back to college.  When she returned to New York, she covered women's golf for The New York Journal, The New York Evening World, the North American Newspaper Alliance, Golf Illustrated and the National Golf Review.  In 1935, she married John D. Crews, a Miami investment-bond broker. They were divorced in 1937 and had no children. She had no immediate survivors.  It was 1937 when Orcutt began covering women's golf and writing a column called ''Women in Sports'' for The New York Times. For years, she was the only woman among some 50 men in the sports department.  All the while she continued to play in tournaments. Among Orcutt's 65 victories were 10 Women's New Jersey Association championships, 7 Women's Eastern match-play titles, 6 New Jersey Amateurs, 5 Metropolitan Seniors, 3 North and South Amateurs, 2 United States Seniors and 2 Canadian Amateurs.  In 1969, she received the first Tanqueray Award for contributions to amateur sports. She was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame and the New York Sports Hall of Fame.  After retiring from The Times in 1972, she moved to Durham, where the mild winters allowed her to play golf year-round. At age 69, she had a hole in one.  Correction:  January 19, 2007, Friday  An obituary last Friday about Maureen Orcutt, an outstanding golfer starting in the 1920s and one of the first women to become a sportswriter, attributed a distinction to her erroneously.

His record in the mile, 4 minutes 6.4 seconds, set in 1937, stood for nearly five years. It was broken, then advanced several times by two runners from Sweden.  Wooderson also held world records for 800 meters and 880 yards.  In 1946, at the European Championships in Oslo, the first major postwar international track meet, Wooderson won the 5,000 meters in 14:08.6, what was then the second-fastest time ever. Three days later, with a troublesome Achilles' tendon, two years removed from rheumatic fever and hinting at the effects of wartime privation, Wooderson retired from international competition. He continued to race, however, and in 1948 won the national cross-country title for the Blackheath Harriers; he later served many years as an official for the club.  Wooderson was known as the Mighty Atom, but he resisted, in bearing and temperament, the extravagance of a nickname. He stood 5 feet 6 inches, weighed barely 125 pounds and wore thick glasses. His poor eyesight kept him out of the war, although he served as a fireman during the blitz of London. He eventually went blind.  Harold Abrahams, the sprinter immortalized in the film ''Chariots of Fire,'' once said, ''If someone were to point out Sydney Wooderson to you on the running track and tell you he was the athlete who had run a mile more quickly than any other human being, you just wouldn't believe it.''  His career was also one of opportunities denied. He failed to advance past the first heat in the 1,500 meters at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, having injured his ankle stepping in a rabbit hole while taking a walk. In 1938, he skipped the Empire Games to take his law school exams. There were no Olympics in 1940 or 1944.  Wooderson remained an inspiration to generations of British runners. Sir Roger Bannister, who in 1954 became the first man to run a mile in under four minutes, remembered watching Wooderson race in 1945. ''He was always a gallant fighter, and I admired him as much for his attitude to running as for the feats he achieved,'' Bannister wrote in his autobiography. ''He was a methodical and unassuming athlete who gave up his time and energy to encourage youngsters even if they showed no promise.''  Like all European athletes before commercial trans-Atlantic flight, Wooderson had limited exposure to his American counterparts. But in June 1939, he arrived at Princeton for what was billed as the Mile of the Century, a showdown against the great United States runners Glenn Cunningham, whose world record Wooderson had broken, and Archie San Romani. A year earlier, Cunningham ran 4:04.4 on a fast indoor track at Dartmouth. The International Amateur Athletics Federation would not recognize the time because Cunningham was paced for each quarter-mile by a different sprinter. But his feat was not lost on other milers.  The race on the Princeton cinders proved a disappointment from the start, with slow splits for the first two laps assuring that there would be no record. With a half-lap to go, Wooderson, who had led the entire way, collided with another runner and stumbled. He finished last in the five-man field, the victory going to Chuck Fenske. The British newspapers cried foul and clamored for a rematch. Wooderson said, characteristically, ''It's better forgotten.''  Wooderson ran his fastest mile, 4:04.2, in 1945, finishing second to Arne Andersson, one of the Swedes who had lowered his world record. But his last chance at Olympic glory ended in disappointment. Asked to carry the Olympic torch into Wembley Stadium to open the 1948 London Games, he was told upon arriving that the honor would go to someone else. According to the organizer of the torch relay, the organizing committee wanted ''a handsome final runner to light the Olympic flame'' and that ''even the then-Queen remarked to me, 'Of course we couldn't have had poor little Sydney.' ''  Wooderson was made a Member of the British Empire in 2000.  He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Pamela, a son and a daughter.  Correction:  January 29, 2007, Monday  An obituary on Jan. 2 about Sydney Wooderson, a British runner who once held the world record for the mile, misstated the name of the federation that did not recognize a 1938 record for the 4:04.4 mile set by Glenn Cunningham at Dartmouth. It was the International Amateur Athletic Federation, not Athletics.  The obituary also referred incompletely to the reasons given by the federation for rejecting the record. It did not recognize any indoor records until 1987, and it has never recognized indoor records set on tracks with laps longer than 220 yards; the Dartmouth track was 264 yards a lap. (As the obituary noted, the federation also rejected the record because Cunningham used four different quarter milers to pace him.)",

            "fulltext": "The economy seems to be shaking off a slowdown brought on by the precipitous drop in housing, the latest economic data suggested yesterday.  More new home construction was started in December than in November, the Census Bureau reported, and the Consumer Price Index, the nation's best-known inflation gauge, rose at its fastest pace in eight months -- on the surface, at least, an indication of robust demand. Fine print in the reports, however, signaled that the five-year-old recovery is far from being on solid ground.  ''The economy is performing significantly better than many economists had expected as recently as a month ago,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist for the Investment Strategies Group at Bank of America. ''But the housing downturn and cutbacks in auto production are still likely to hamper growth.''  The housing starts came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.6 million units, up 4.5 percent from the November rate. The number of building permits issued last month also rose, suggesting that prices may have fallen enough to draw people back into the market.  Nevertheless, the increase in construction starts was entirely in apartment buildings. Builders started fewer single-family homes in December than in November. And compared with a year ago, permits and construction for any type of housing were down about 25 percent.  ''Very simply, the benchmark single-family sector is very weak,'' Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, wrote to his clients.  The inflation numbers were also ambiguous. The 0.5 percent increase in December came after no increase in November, and sharp drops in September and October.  Not since the 0.6 percent rise in April, has the Consumer Price Index jumped so sharply in one month -- suggesting to Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, that inflation is far from subdued, as the Federal Reserve would like.  ''All this talk about the Fed lowering rates is looking increasingly unlikely,'' Mr. Baumohl said, ''and the possibility is growing that the Fed will have to raise rates in the second half of this year.'' Like many economists, Mr. Baumohl focuses mainly on the so-called core inflation rate, which measures price changes other than those for food and energy.  The core rate rose 0.2 percent in December, matching the increase in four of the last six months. It appears to be leveling off, he said, at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, which was the year-over-year increase reported yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  If so, that would be well above the 1 to 2 percent annual rate that Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, describes as acceptable.  Patrick Jackman, an economist at the bureau, argued that home rents are playing a big role in the core rate's steady increase to 2.6 percent last year from 2.2 percent in 2004 and 2005. The bureau measures housing costs not by the purchase price of a house, but by rents and by what it describes as the rental equivalent of owning a home.  Indeed, more people are seeking to rent homes, driving up rental prices. Compounding the impact on inflation, no other item counts as heavily as rents in the bureau's monthly calculation of changes in the Consumer Price Index.  Most of the 0.2 percent increase in the core inflation rate last month came from rising rents, the bureau reported. Meanwhile, the cost of many other major items -- recreation, for example, education and health care -- rose only mildly or not at all. Car prices fell.  The two exceptions were apparel and tobacco prices, the former going up because of an anomaly in the seasonal adjustment formula the bureau uses for the Christmas season, and the latter because wholesalers raised prices last month.  ''If I were on the Fed, I would say there is really no inflationary pressure in the broad economy,'' Mr. Jackman said.  The 0.5 percent increase in the overall inflation rate last month came mainly from a spike in fuel costs. After falling from August until early November, fuel prices rose until late December -- and then started to fall again.  Absent the spike in gas prices, the overall price index would have risen by about 1.25 percent last month. Oil prices in 2006 rose much more slowly than in 2005. As a result, the rise of 2.5 percent in the overall price index last year was well below the 3.4 percent increase in 2005.  ''Inflation does seem to be subsiding,'' Ms. Reaser said, ''and I think that will continue partly because the Fed's earlier rate increases are still putting a lid on economic growth.''",

Several government reports suggested that the economy remains robust -- perhaps too much so to justify a cut in the Fed funds rate, the Fed's benchmark short-term rate, which has remained at 5.25 percent since June. On Friday, for example, the Commerce Department said that new-home sales in December jumped to an annual rate of 1.12 million units, and durable-goods orders in December rose 3.1 percent.

            "fulltext": "American companies sold more goods like airplanes, cars and precious metals overseas in November, helping to narrow the trade deficit for a third consecutive month.  Despite the improvement, the United States is still on track to end 2006 with a record trade imbalance, eclipsing the $716.7 billion deficit in 2005.  The Census Bureau reported yesterday that the trade deficit -- the amount by which the value of America's imports of goods and services exceeded the value of its exports -- fell to $58.2 billion in November, the smallest it has been since July 2005. In October, the deficit was $58.8 billion.  Yesterday's figures surprised many economists, most of whom expected the deficit to widen. Through November, the cumulative deficit for 2006 was $701.6 billion, well within reach of the previous record.  But some economists expect the trade outlook to improve this year as a weaker dollar combined with a slower domestic economy and stronger growth overseas help narrow the disparity between imports and exports.  ''The factors that are causing the improvement are really in the case of exports and the strengths of the economies abroad,'' said Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with the Bank of America. ''Japan continues to grow moderately, and emerging Asia is growing at a good clip, led by China. Then Europe also continues to at least outperform expectations. When you put all of that together, that's a boost to U.S. exports.''  In November, exports grew to $124.8 billion, from $123.7 billion in October. The increase was fairly broad-based. Exports of consumer goods like jewelry and sporting goods rose, as did exports of heavy duty goods like parts for commercial aircraft.  At the same time, imports are slowing. American businesses imported $183 billion worth of goods and services in November, up $500 million from October. That brought the three-month moving average for imports down to $184.3 billion, the lowest level since June.  The gap narrowed in November in part because Americans bought fewer goods from China, one of the nation's main trading partners. The net deficit with China fell to $22.9 billion in November, down from $24.4 billion in October. Also, the trade gap shrank because of the third monthly decline in petroleum imports, a factor that economists expect to help improve the trade gap this year if oil prices continue falling.  The Chinese government reported its full-year trade figures yesterday as well, posting a record surplus of $177.5 billion with the world as a whole in 2006. China's exports, and its surplus, continue to grow rapidly; the 2006 surplus was 75 percent greater than 2005's. Imbalanced trade with China has become an issue straining relations with the United States.  Top American officials, including the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, traveled to China last month to press for a shift in the country's trade and currency policies. China accounts for a larger portion of the deficit than any other country.  A reason that Washington says that trade with China remains one-sided is the exchange rate. China keeps its currency, the yuan, loosely pegged to the dollar and the euro at a level that many economists say is undervalued, making its exports affordable and imported goods more expensive.  But economists expect Chinese imports to have less appeal in the United States as a slowing housing market damps consumer appetites.  ''I imagine as U.S. domestic demand growth slows,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist with Capital Economics, ''the wider trade deficit with China will probably continue to grow, but probably at a slower pace.''  Also yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that inventories at American wholesalers accumulated in November at the fastest pace in three months, a sign that imports could slow further.  Surplus Widens in Canada  OTTAWA, Jan. 10 (Bloomberg News) -- Canada's trade surplus widened more than expected in November to the largest since March, as exports of cars and energy products rebounded.  The surplus widened to 4.67 billion Canadian dollars ($3.97 billion), from a revised 3.76 billion Canadian dollars in October, Statistics Canada said. Exports rose 2.8 percent, to 38.1 billion Canadian dollars ($32.4 billion).",

            "fulltext": "HOUSING bulls took heart on Dec. 27, when the Commerce Department reported that sales of new one-family homes rose 3.4 percent in November from October. While the figure was still well below the rate of November 2005, it represented a recovery from the sharp declines of the summer.  ''Sales of new and existing homes showed tentative signs of stabilizing, although at levels well below their mid-2005 peaks,'' the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee said at its December meeting.  But those who think that the worst may be over for the housing market should take another look at the data, economists say. For the figures on new-home sales have a strange wrinkle that, in the current environment, may lead the government to overstate sales (and to understate inventory) by up to 20 percent. ''The market is weaker than the data say,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's/Economy.com.  New-home sales are tallied by the Census Bureau, based on a sampling of contracts signed by home buyers. Running at a pace of more than one million a year for the last four years, new-home sales have been a significant contributor to the housing boom -- and to the economy. (Existing-home sales, reported monthly by the National Association of Realtors, count actual closings.)  But here's the rub: If a contract to buy a home, signed in November, is canceled in December, the Census Bureau does not subtract the failed transaction from the number of sales, or add the house back to its inventory total. In the last year, as the housing market has cooled, the volume of cancellations has risen to epidemic proportions.  Speculators who signed contracts to buy homes in new communities in hot markets like Florida simply walked away from their deposits when they realized they couldn't flip the houses for a quick profit. And as prices and interest rates rose, noted Joseph Carson, chief economist at AllianceBernstein, ''people who committed to making new home purchases found they were having difficulty selling their own houses.''  And so, in the quarter ended on Oct. 31, Toll Brothers, the high-end home builder, noted that cancellations totaled 37 percent of contracts signed in the quarter, up from 18 percent in the same quarter the previous year. Pulte Homes, the builder based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., reported a 36 percent cancellation rate in its third quarter, up from 17 percent in the 2005 third quarter.  ''Cancellations have really affected big, publicly held builders the most, because they are relatively heavily concentrated in what had been the hottest markets,'' said Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. Basing his findings on a survey of 30 large builders, Mr. Seiders concluded that in November 2006, cancellations constituted 38 percent of gross sales, compared with 26 percent in November 2005 and about 18 percent in the first half of 2005.  Of course, the large publicly held builders comprise a minority of the home-building industry. Lawrence Yun, senior economist at the National Association of Realtors, noted that ''smaller home builders aren't affected as much by cancellations because they generally try to sign up clients before they start construction.''  On its Web site, the Census Bureau acknowledges: ''As a result of our methodology, if conditions are worsening in the marketplace and cancellations are high, sales would be temporarily overestimated.'' By how much? Mr. Carson of AllianceBernstein estimates that the government is overestimating the pace of annual sales by 100,000 to 150,000. Mr. Zandi of Economy.com estimates that the differential is even greater. ''Given the rise in cancellation rates, it suggests that between 150,000 and 200,000 home sales are being counted that actually did not occur.''  Just as the rising tide of cancellations leads the Census Bureau to overreport sales in the short term, it leads the government to underreport inventories. New homes on which contracts are not consummated are not added back into the inventory figure. The most recent report found that the seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of November was 545,000, or 6.3 months of supply. Given the high rate of cancellations, it's likely that inventory is substantially higher.  This much is clear: Given the failure of the reports to account for cancellations, demand isn't as strong as it appears, and supply is greater than it seems.  The large builders are clearly taking action to remedy the situation. In recent months, they have thrown in extras and cut prices as part of an effort to reduce inventory. These moves may have stemmed the tide of cancellations. ''In our survey of big builders, the absolute volume of sales cancellations did seem to top out in the third quarter,'' Mr. Seiders said.  That's good news. But it may also mean that the housing market's recovery and stabilization may turn out to be like ski trips planned in the Northeast for the week between Christmas and New Year's. Given the climate, both have been postponed until 2007.  ECONOMIC VIEW",

            "fulltext": "Low mortgage interest rates are buoying the housing market even as experts are debating whether the market has hit bottom.  The recent decline in rates has been relatively small, and there is still concern that the slump will worsen in the spring when more homes come on the market. But the low rates, real estate and mortgage brokers say, have still provided a significant boost to their business, which had dropped significantly from 2005, the best year for home sales in history.  Lower rates get ''them off the fence,'' said Tom Carlson, an agent at Pacific Union GMAC Real Estate in San Francisco. ''There's a sense of urgency that mortgage rates probably will rise.''  The national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 6.04 percent, after peaking at 6.8 percent in late June, according to Bankrate. (These rates are averages for what consumers can expect to pay nationally for conventional home loans.)  Mortgage applications, while they are some distance from their peak during the housing boom a year ago, surged 30 percent in early December from their summer lows as buyers took advantage of falling prices and low rates to buy homes before the holidays.  Daniel and Marcie Quaroni were part of that surge. Last month, the couple agreed to pay $560,000 for a four-bedroom colonial with cathedral ceilings in Waltham, Mass., near Boston; they have a 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 5.88 percent. The young couple had fruitlessly searched for a house in the summer only to realize they could not afford to buy the kind of home they wanted.  Now, however, they have enough money left over to spend nearly $15,000 on improvements like a new air-conditioner, gas stove, granite tile and a new coat of paint.  ''You're talking about a couple of hundred dollars a month'' in savings with lower rates, said Mr. Quaroni, a 28-year-old software engineer. ''That definitely impacts the bottom line. It's basically like we're getting free heat.''  For their cheaper home loans, the Quaronis and other home buyers can thank bond investors, including Asian central banks and hedge funds, who have been lending billions of dollars to the federal government. Mortgage rates are closely tied to the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. After a bout of inflation worries pushed it above 5 percent last summer, the yield on the 10-year note fell to as low as 4.424 percent last month amid hopes that the Federal Reserve would need to cut interest rates this year.  ''It's low long-term interest rates that are helping to provide the safety net for housing,'' said Delores A. Conway, director of the Casden Real Estate Economics Forecast at the University of Southern California.  Yesterday, however, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Donald L. Kohn, dispelled some of the hopes for a rate cut by saying that inflation remained a worry even as lower energy prices help reduce its threat.  ''Despite the recent favorable price data, I believe it is still too early to relax our concerns about whether the run-up in price pressures in the spring and summer of last year is truly unwinding,'' he said at a speech before the Atlanta Rotary Club.  There are also some who are skeptical about a soft landing for housing, noting that sales are still far lower than a year ago and that the number of homes on the market will take more than seven months to sell off. They note that many sellers took their homes off the market late last year after being unable to sell at their desired price. Many of those properties could flood back on the market in the spring, which is the busiest part of the sales year.  While still low, yields and interest rates have been inching back up of late. Since early December, for instance, the yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen from 4.42 percent to 4.65 percent yesterday, after recent reports suggested that the economy was growing faster than earlier thought. The rate on the 30-year conventional mortgage climbed back to 6.04 percent, from 5.8 percent.  Mortgage applications have fallen since peaking in early December, though at least some of that is probably a function of a seasonal slowdown during the holidays.  Ms. Conway and many other economists do not expect yields and rates to rise significantly from current levels in the coming 12 months.  Still, a sustained climb in interest rates could hit some parts of the housing market harder than others. The East and West Coasts and the Southwest remain vulnerable because a surge of new construction has left them with a big inventory of homes for sale.  If rates ''keep going down, it will help,'' said W. Scott Simon, a managing director at Pimco Advisors. ''But it postpones the inevitable. You still have massive amounts of inventory on the market.''  Furthermore, many borrowers may not be able to take advantage of the current lower interest rates because banking regulators issued rules late last year to tighten lending standards on adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans made to borrowers with poor credit scores, known as subprime loans.  Under the regulations, banks will have to judge the creditworthiness of borrowers by whether they can afford to make monthly payments at the highest interest rates possible under hybrid loans that start with low, introductory rates.  ''The ability to get credit is tightening, especially in subprime,'' Mr. Simon said.  Adjustable-rate loans, which drove the boom in home prices in California and other formerly hot housing markets, have also lost much of their attractiveness. The rates on such mortgages are more closely tied to short-term rates, which rose steadily in 2005 and 2006 and have remained high even as longer-term rates have fallen. For instance, the rate on a one-year adjustable rate loan was 5.12 percent yesterday, up from 4 percent in early 2005, according to Bankrate.  ''The housing bubble was worst in areas where people were using adjustable-rate mortgages,'' said David Kelly, a senior economic adviser at Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company. ''In those bubble areas, the slide may continue for a while.''  In an odd twist, the interests of the housing market are aligned, at least for the time being, with a slow-growing economy that keeps inflation at bay, encourages investors to lend and allows the Fed to start cutting interest rates this year.  ''We really need that outcome for a gradual upswing on the sales side,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.  By contrast, strong growth, which is typically considered good for housing, could send inflation higher and prompt the Fed to raise interest rates, spooking bond investors and driving up mortgage interest rates. Another threat would be any move by big foreign investors like the central banks of Japan and China to reduce their purchases of United States Treasury securities.  Jeffrey J. Jaye, a mortgage broker in Danville, Calif., said he had seen a flood of applications from people looking to buy and refinance their mortgages in December, a usually quiet period of the year. Many are moving from adjustable-rate loans to fixed-rate mortgages, he added.  ''They are seeing the big adjustment coming,'' said Mr. Jaye, who is the executive vice president of the Upfront Mortgage Brokers Association, a trade group. ''They are taking advantage of the lower-rate environment.''  So, is the worst over for housing? For at least some experts, that is too great a leap to make, especially with data showing that residential building continues to slow around the country even with lower mortgage rates providing a boost to sales and to refinancing activity.  ''We are close to the bottom, but I don't think we have hit bottom as far as construction news is concerned,'' said Frank E. Nothaft, a vice president and chief economist at Freddie Mac, the buyer of mortgages. ''What we will probably see is a couple more bumpy reports before we hit the trough. Longer term, I do think the outlook is very positive for the housing sector as long as we continue to have economic growth and mortgage rates at the 6 to 7 percent rate.''",

            "fulltext": "TALK of a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut began spreading almost from the moment of the last rate increase, in June, but it is now sounding more like urban legend than economic analysis.  The Fed stopped raising short-term rates last summer and is expected to hold firm again on Wednesday, yet it has continued to warn of the risks of inflation and offered few, if any, hints of a cut. Wall Street got a reality check when the employment report a month ago showed surprising strength, and one market strategist expects another dose of uncomfortable economic facts on Friday, in the next update on jobs.  A Bloomberg News poll of economists predicts 140,000 net new jobs in January, down from 167,000 last month. Edward E. Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, warns that stocks and bonds may sell off if, as he anticipates, the final figure is closer to 200,000.  ''If the number is stronger than expected and we get a '2' handle, the markets won't be too happy with it,'' he said. ''It would definitely bury any expectations still out there that the Fed's next move will be an easing one anytime soon.''  Mr. Yardeni noted that in past economic growth spurts, 200,000 new jobs a month was routine. But that has changed, he said.  ''At the Fed there's a perception that somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000, there's a number consistent with an economic expansion that's quite mature and an unemployment rate that's close to full employment,'' he said.  But Mr. Yardeni contends that the economy has more room to maneuver, that jobs can be added at a faster pace without a worrisome rise in wage inflation. He expects his belief to be put to the test this year. He thinks that unemployment, now at 4.5 percent, will decline to 3.5 percent, a level unseen since 1969.  ''Most economists subscribe to the theory that there's no trade-off between unemployment and inflation,'' he said. ''You can have an even tighter labor market and better-than-expected economic growth without inflation.''  But Mr. Yardeni said that stronger job reports would worry the markets unless a certain handful of economists made clear that they held to the same theory.  ''I'm entitled to my opinion,'' Mr. Yardeni said, ''but at the end of the day what matters is what they think at the Fed.''  DATA WATCH -- Other items on a busy economic calendar include the Institute of Supply Management's snapshot on Thursday of the nation's manufacturing activity in January. The Bloomberg poll predicts a slight increase, to a reading of 51.6 from 51.4 in December.  The same day, reports on personal spending and income in December are expected to show increases. Income is estimated to have risen 0.5 percent, after a 0.3 percent gain in November. Spending is predicted to show a 0.7 percent increase, versus a November climb of 0.5 percent.  MARKET WEEK",

            "fulltext": "WOMEN generally have better credit scores than men, so why do they pay considerably more for mortgages than men?  That is the question at the heart of a study released last month by the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit advocacy group, showing that women are 32 percent more likely to carry mortgages with high interest rates than men with similar incomes. And wealthier women were 50 percent more likely to carry expensive loans than their male counterparts.  ''When people are paying 7.5 percent or 9.5 percent interest on a mortgage loan, it really slows the wealth-building effect of home ownership,'' said Allen Fishbein, the federation's director of housing and credit policy. ''It can be a tremendous drain.''  The study, which relied on 2005 federal data on mortgages from across the country, focused on so-called subprime loans, which lenders typically market to those with credit ratings lower than 660 and with other credit characteristics that make them higher-risk borrowers. In 2005, interest rates on prime mortgage loans averaged 5.87 percent, Mr. Fishbein said, compared with 7.66 percent for subprime loans, and more than 9.66 percent for the highest-cost category of subprime loans.  In 2005, according to the study, 10 percent of women who took out mortgages received the highest-cost subprime loans, compared with about 7.5 percent of men.  Mr. Fishbein said that although the data he used for the study did not include credit scores and debt-to-income ratios, this would not have been enough to explain the mortgage discrepancies between men and women.  Mr. Fishbein said the most likely reason for the disparity was that women were less familiar with the mortgage market than men and were therefore less likely to shop around for the best mortgage deal. ''There is some research indicating that women are, on the whole, less likely than men to bargain for major consumer purchases and credit transactions,'' he said.  ''And one of the things that's still relatively unknown is that mortgage loans can be negotiated with lenders and brokers,'' Mr. Fishbein added.  Mortgage industry executives and consumer advocates alike say that borrowers should start their mortgage shopping by getting free credit reports from major reporting bureaus like Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. (Borrowers can often spruce up their ratings by getting errors and black marks removed.)  After that, borrowers should research the going rates for mortgage loans given to prime borrowers. Rates typically quoted on banks' Web sites and by aggregators like BankRate.com reflect prime interest rates. The lower borrowers' credit scores, the higher the interest rates they can expect to pay, but lenders and brokers compete aggressively for business, and they will often reduce their fees and interest rates if borrowers bring in competing offers.  African-American women are particularly likely to take out subprime loans, according to the study. In fact, those who earn less than the median income in their region are nearly two and a half times more likely to receive a subprime mortgage than white men with the same incomes. Upper-income African-American women are nearly five times more likely to receive such loans than upper-income white men.  Ellen Bitton, the chief executive of the Park Avenue Mortgage Group, a brokerage firm in Manhattan, said she was surprised by the findings. ''Maybe there are other markets in the country where the numbers are really coming from,'' she said, ''but it doesn't seem to me to reflect the market in New York City.''  In some cases, Ms. Bitton said, a couple with a bankruptcy or a foreclosure on their record will take out a subprime mortgage because it is the only option. ''And many times the husband has the lower credit score, so they might put the mortgage into the wife's name,'' she said.  Otherwise, Ms. Bitton said, ''I'm really shocked by this data.''

            "fulltext": "A tight labor market is pushing up many workers' wages, consumers are spending more at their local shopping malls and the skid in the housing market is easing in some areas of the country.  These observations, reported in the latest regional survey of economic conditions by the Federal Reserve, offered further evidence that the economy is expanding at a slower pace, but one that has so far defied predictions of a sharper slowdown.  The Fed's report, known as the beige book from its jacket cover, came amid other signs of economic resilience yesterday.  A survey of industrial production showed unexpected growth last month. Furthermore, a sampling of confidence among home builders rose in December.  Together, the findings are consistent with some other signs of a muted but healthy expansion -- including job growth and rising stock prices -- that have come into clearer focus recently.  Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, commented: ''In the last few weeks we've been getting a string of data that consistently seem to point to an economy that is turning out to be stronger than anyone expected. We really are shifting into a higher gear.''  Yet there were reminders on two fronts yesterday that resurgent inflation could counterbalance such positive data. In remarks at an economic conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Janet L. Yellen, said that a labor market ''going gangbusters'' could touch off a spike in prices. And a Labor Department report showed that the prices businesses charge one another for a wide range of wholesale goods rose in December.  The Producer Price Index increased 0.9 percent last month and 1.1 percent for all of 2006, significantly slower than 2005 but fast enough to give some investors and economists pause. Stocks closed down yesterday after a day of mixed trading.  Food became a lot more expensive in December, causing much of the overall increase. The prices of fruit and vegetables jumped by more than one-fifth. Chicken and fish also cost significantly more than in November. And economists noted that with freezing temperatures laying waste to crops in California in recent days, food prices are likely to increase further.  Rising energy costs also contributed to the overall increase in producer prices. Gasoline climbed 7.1 percent and home heating oil was up 4 percent. Still, the rate of increase was down significantly from November.  Some economists said that the new report was not likely to change any minds among Federal Reserve policy makers as they consider whether to change their essentially neutral stance on interest rates when they meet at the end of the month. The Fed generally gives more weight to the Consumer Price Index, which will be released today, as a gauge of inflation in the economy.  Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, said, ''The fact is that when you look at the correlation between the Producer Price Index and the price increases the Fed watches more closely, there's not real high month-to-month correlation.''  Whether the rise in wholesale costs portends a rise in prices for consumers is unclear, and economists dispute this point.  ''We're starting to see some yellow flags now,'' Mr. Baumohl said. ''I won't call them red, but there are some flags.''  The beige book, which surveyed economic conditions from late in November through early January, said that overall inflation was moderate, and in some cases appeared to be stabilizing. In New York, for example, businesses reported some increase in cost pressures, ''but no discernable acceleration in consumer prices.''  John Shin, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said the overall theme of the report -- moderate and healthy overall growth -- was consistent with what Fed officials have been saying recently about the state of the economy. ''The basic message of the Fed is still one of fairly strong inertia,'' he said.  While wages rose moderately in most regions, there was little evidence that businesses increased prices as a result. Finding workers, especially skilled ones, continued to be a problem for businesses in most parts of the country. The Kansas City Fed reported worker shortages of many kinds, in groups as diverse as hotel housekeepers and accountants. In West Virginia, a retailer reported having to pay lower-wage workers more because competition for their services was so tight.  Almost all housing markets experienced continued softening. But real estate activity in Manhattan remained relatively isolated from the price declines, with sales of co-ops and condominiums rising noticeably. Manhattan rents rose by an estimated 5 percent on average, with the increases on small apartments steeper.  The Fed's report noted that a ''significant proportion'' of new condos were being purchased by investors, who turn around and rent the units.  Commercial real estate activity was even stronger. Vacancy rates in Lower Manhattan and Midtown fell to their lowest levels in more than five years. In upstate New York and New Jersey, however, sales were sluggish, the report said.  Elsewhere, there were signs that the market was leveling off. In Richmond, Va., for example, real estate agents said sales grew 9 percent in December compared with a year earlier. In Minneapolis and St. Paul, where inventories of unsold homes declined, contractors are adapting to the slowdown by focusing on remodeling rather than new construction.",

            "fulltext": "The cost of putting a roof over one's head in the New York metropolitan region rose faster last year than at any other time since Edward I. Koch was mayor, the federal Labor Department reported yesterday.  The cost of housing was the main driver of inflation in the region in 2006, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over all, consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in the region last year, but the cost of shelter rose 6.5 percent, the biggest leap since 1989, said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of labor statistics.  ''The prices of homes in the last couple of years have gone up very, very significantly,'' Mr. Dolfman said, adding that shelter costs in the region are a mixed measure of apartment rents and home ownership.  The previous peak in housing inflation came just before a wrenching recession that dragged the region's housing market into a long slump. So far, the market for real estate has remained strong locally, though it has weakened rapidly in other parts of the country.  Nationally, the cost of housing rose 4.2 percent in 2006, while overall consumer prices increased 2.5 percent.  ''There is kind of a parallel between the mid- to-late 1980s and what we're seeing today in terms of rapid appreciation,'' said Michael Slattery, a senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York.  Prices are still rising locally, but at a significantly slower rate than in the first half of 2006, Mr. Slattery said. That moderation indicates that current prices may be sustainable, he said, adding that there were no signs of a significant downturn like the one that occurred in the early 1990s.  The overall index of housing costs, which takes into account the cost of utilities as well as rents and mortgage costs, rose 5.4 percent last year, which was also the fastest rate of increase since 1989, when it rose 6.5 percent, Mr. Dolfman said.  Housing supplanted energy costs as the financial gremlin for local consumers last year, the bureau's figures show. After soaring in 2005, energy costs rose just 1.7 percent last year, the bureau said.  The price of gasoline rose 5.3 percent, while the cost of natural gas for heating homes fell 6 percent and electricity rose just 1.7 percent.  The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes changes in the prices of food and energy because they are volatile, rose 3.7 percent in the region last year, the biggest annual increase since 1993, the bureau reported.  The only other category of consumer spending that increased 5 percent or more in the region last year was the cost of eating in restaurants. Prices of food outside the home rose 5 percent, while the cost of groceries was flat.  For the country as a whole, the cost of eating out rose more slowly (3.2 percent), but the cost of eating in rose faster (1.4 percent), according to the Labor Department.",

            "fulltext": "In the last 30 years, no major economy in the world has grown at the speed of China's, and no other country has been able to do it year after year, for over a decade.  And on Thursday China did it again, saying that its economy grew by a whopping 10.7 percent in 2006, the fastest pace in more than a decade, with only modest signs of inflation.  ''This is pretty impressive,'' said Shen Minggao, an economist in Beijing for Citigroup. ''I'd say 2006 was about the best year in a decade -- fast growth and low inflation.''  The 10.7 percent growth recorded in 2006 was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit economic growth and China's strongest year since 1995, when the economy grew 10.9 percent.  The economic miracle -- fueled by soaring exports and huge investments in buildings, roads and cities -- goes on even in the face of frequent warnings from government officials and private specialists about asset bubbles, excessive bank lending and an overheating economy.  ''Right now, the economy is growing at the upper limits of what is acceptable,'' said Li Lianfa, an economist at Peking University. ''The government is facing a lot of challenges.''  Chief among them are balancing the supersize growth and heavy investment, and trying to distribute the riches as evenly as possible.  Analysts say the government is determined to keep the economy revving, but is also wants to prevent anything from spoiling the party before 2008, when Beijing is to play host to the Olympic Games.  To help cool the economy, Beijing has raised interest rates and pressured banks to temper lending, with some results. Fixed-asset investment slowed in the latter part of last year, for instance, and economic growth in the last months of 2006 slowed from a feverish second-quarter pace of 11.5 percent.  Many economists are now forecasting that Beijing will take additional steps, possibly raising interest rates again early this year.  Beijing is also under pressure to allow the Chinese currency, the yuan or renminbi, to appreciate more quickly against the dollar, in the hope of easing the country's trade surplus with the United States.  The yuan has strengthened somewhat against the dollar, climbing to about 7.8 yuan to the dollar, from 8.26 yuan in 2005.  Economists have warned that if the yuan does not continue to appreciate against the dollar and other major currencies, China could face protectionist action, which could pose an even more serious threat to economic growth.  These are the trials of a country where everything is red hot -- foreign investment, trade, real estate and stock prices, which climbed more than 130 percent last year and have soared even higher in the opening weeks of this year.  Although inflation, driven largely by higher food prices, jumped to 2.8 percent in December, from 1.9 percent in November, analysts say they are not overly concerned about inflationary pressure. The core inflation number, excluding volatile items like food, was modest, with inflation rising just 1.5 percent in 2006.  But other economists say that accelerated growth often leads to higher prices, and that there could be a lag before stronger signs of inflationary pressure are seen.  Among the government's chief worries has been overinvestment in certain sectors of the economy, like real estate. Stock prices are another concern. After dipping to their lowest level in six years in mid-2005, stock prices in Shanghai have nearly tripled in a record-breaking run.  The central bank said that last October, for the first time in five years, the bank savings of Chinese citizens slid from the month before as more money went into the stock market. An abrupt change in the market, analysts say, could create havoc.  While the stock run-up means that Chinese companies can once again raise money with stock offerings in the domestic market rather than relying on the Hong Kong stock market, huge risks remain. Analysts have long derided the Chinese market as a gambling den crowded with companies using suspect accounting.  In yet another effort to tame the economy, the government raised the banking reserve requirement ratio last month, to help restrict lending. And several economists say they expect interest rate increases in the coming months.  But not all specialists share the view that China's booming economy is in any jeopardy. One such contrarian is Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS, who says his firm's internal figures show that China's economic growth has actually moderated over the last few years. Those figures show that the Chinese economy was growing even faster, at closer to 12 percent, not the 10 percent the government reported.  So the new numbers, he says, are not so alarming.  ''This really shouldn't be an issue for the authorities,'' he said. ''What you're seeing is a very stable economic situation with very little inflation.''",

As a media player, the N800 handles MP3 and Windows Media files and other common audio and video formats, displaying images on a 4.1-inch color screen and playing audio through built-in stereo speakers or a headphone. Content can be loaded from SD or MMC memory cards, streamed from the Web or downloaded through a U.S.B. connection from another computer. The tablet uses Wi-Fi networking, but it can also connect to a compatible Nokia phone via Bluetooth and use it as a wireless modem.  The tablet, available from retailers and www.nokiausa.com for $400, has an on-screen keyboard. It will recognize text written with a stylus, which can also be used for doodling.

            "fulltext": "Offline Options For Backup  Q. What are the alternatives for backing up a computer's data if you don't want to use an online service?  A. Online services that let you back up your computer's files to a remote server can put your mind at ease, but they are just one option for stashing copies of your valuable files and folders. Because computer hard drives can be quite large, many people still use the traditional backup method of copying files onto an even larger external hard drive.  Many hard-drive makers include basic backup software with their drives, and you can also buy your own preferred program for Windows or Macintosh at most computer stores. Maxtor, LaCie, Western Digital and Iomega are among the many makers of external drives designed for home users. Prices vary, but it is possible to find a 250-gigabyte external drive for $150 or less on the Web.  Most drives now use the U.S.B. 2.0 connection to copy data between drives at a relatively fast clip. You can usually use a U.S.B. 2.0 drive with an older computer that just has U.S.B. 1.1 ports, but the data-transfer speeds will be much slower. Some backup drives also have FireWire connections, which are found on many Macintosh computers.  Although it is usually not included in the default installation, Windows XP has its own backup software that you can install from your Windows XP system discs. Mac OS X users with .Mac accounts can use Apple's free backup software.  Once you select a drive and install your backup software, you can set it up to back up your files, songs, pictures, videos and other data at regularly scheduled intervals, so if you accidentally delete a file or your computer dies, you have a copy of everything. Depending on how much data you have, most backup programs let you back up your files to a recordable CD or DVD instead of a hard drive.  Smartphones And the Mac  Q. Many of the best new smartphones run Windows Mobile or seem to be otherwise PC-only for synching data. Is there any way to use one with Mac OS X?  A. Smartphones, the Internet-connected hand-helds that combine voice calling with e-mail and other functions, typically allow you to transfer contact and calendar information between Mac and phone. If the smartphone you seek doesn't come with Mac OS X software, you can often find a third-party program that will sync up the phone and your Mac. (Apple's recently announced smartphone, the iPhone, will certainly be compatible with the Mac, but its price, exclusive arrangement with Cingular Wireless and lack of availability until midyear may put it out of contention for many people.)  PocketMac (pocketmac.com) and the Missing Sync (markspace.com) are two families of synchronization programs that let Macs communicate with smartphones and other devices designed for Windows. Both offer software for use with Windows Mobile smartphones, although PocketMac is still working on support for Windows Mobile 5.0; both also have programs, or soon will, designed to sync a Mac to some versions of the BlackBerry hand-held. Expect to pay $20 to $40 for the software, depending on what device you use.  Owners of newer Macs running Intel processors also have the more expensive option of installing Apple's free Boot Camp software and buying a copy of Windows XP to use the system on their Macs. Programs like Parallels Desktop for Mac ($80 at parallels.com) also let you run many Windows programs on a Mac.  Gatekeeping For Pop-Ups  Q. Is there a way to temporarily override the function that blocks pop-up windows in my Web browser to browse sites that legitimately use pop-ups?  A. Most Web browsers -- including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari -- now include a function that blocks the pesky pop-up and pop-under windows favored by advertisers. This feature can cause problems, however, with sites like banks that sometimes use the extra windows for certain functions.  Check your browser's settings or preferences area for the pop-up blocker function. On many versions of Internet Explorer or Firefox, you can choose to allow pop-ups only from certain sites -- and have the browser block the rest. In the Safari browser for Mac OS X, you can quickly turn pop-up blocking off or on with a keyboard shortcut (Command-K) when you get to a site that uses pop-ups you want to see.  J. D.

Using a non-Windows-based PC may be one defense against these programs, known as malware; also, anti-malware programs and antivirus utilities for the PC are available from several vendors. Windows users should use the Windows update feature.  Microsoft itself entered the computer-security business last year and now offers a free malware-removal tool for download from its Web site. The company says the program removes about two million pieces of malware each month, of which 200,000, or about 10 percent, are botnet infections.  Like Windows, Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is also a large, convenient target for code-writing vandals. Alternative browsers, like Firefox and Opera, may insulate users. Microsoft's most recent browser release, Internet Explorer 7, is said to offer significantly improved defenses.  Adding software to your browser like Noscript, a plug-in utility, can limit the ability of remote programs to run potentially damaging programs on your PC.  Security experts also offer these tips:  Don't share your computer (on which you pay your bills) with your children (who download games).  Use a firewall program that warns you about outgoing connections that botnets make to communicate with control software.  Don't use the same password on more than one financial site.  Don't let your browser store your password for such sites.  Don't buy anything offered by a spammer.  Don't click if someone offers you something too good to be true. It is.  JOHN MARKOFF",

The CU400 is a G.S.M. phone that will work on cellular networks overseas. The push-to-talk service allows you to connect to another user of the service on Cingular or even send a broadcast message to up to 30 contacts.  The phone has a monochrome external screen, a bright main screen, a basic camera, Bluetooth wireless capabilities and supports Cingular's streaming audio and video services. It offers about five hours of talk time on one charge and weighs three ounces.  The CU400 sells for $30 with a two-year contract and rebate or $230 without a contract.

Those devices, typically costing $200 to $400, let you do more than just make phone calls and take pictures. They are pocket-size computers equipped for many functions, including e-mail, Web browsing and contact management, note taking, financial recordkeeping and a calendar.  But as it turns out, that humble cellphone in your pocket may be able to do all this and more, depending on its built-in features and the available add-on software.  The screen may be a bit smaller than on a palmtop, and you will lack an alphanumeric keyboard, making typing a lot harder -- but as anyone who has sent text messages or entered names into their phone's address book knows, you can peck out letters using the numeric keypad.  Cellphone manufacturers, carriers and independent application providers are now offering lots of programs and services that can be used on a wide number of phones. Not all services work on all phones. Some are carrier-specific, and some work only on certain phones.  Many require that the phone be able to handle programs written in Java (most new ones are). Some services are free; others charge a monthly fee.  There are a variety of ways to get these applications, and you probably already have some. In addition to Bluetooth and a camera, the Nokia 6102i, effectively free after a rebate from Cingular Wireless, comes with software applications including an audio recorder, an alarm clock, a calendar, a to-do list, a note taker, a calculator, a countdown timer and a stopwatch. It also has AOL, Yahoo, ICQ and MSN instant messengers, a text messaging program, an FM radio, e-mail and, of course, an Internet browser.  And all of this is before you download any applications over the wireless network from the Cingular Mall, where you can buy games, ring tones, graphics and other applications.  Sprint's Samsung M500, available for as little as $9.99 after rebate, has a comparable list of built-in features, along with a dictionary and the ability to store files and play music. Like more expensive hand-helds, it comes with a U.S.B. cable to sync with a PC and a 64-megabyte microSD card (for about $30 you can buy a one-gigabyte card) to store MP3 files that you can play on the phone.  It can even display an analog clock, but the real power of this and many other phones is the applications you can buy and download.  Some of the productivity programs that can be downloaded from Sprint are RandMcNally StreetFinder, MapQuest Mobile, Vindigo City Guide, Zagat restaurant guide and FlyteSource Mobile, which gives real-time flight status. These or similar services are also available on phones from other carriers.  All cellular carriers offer some type of e-mail service, sometimes for an extra fee. But consumers have choices. In addition to the carrier's services, there are free third-party services you can use, including Yahoo Mail, Gmail and Flurry.  Before using any of these services or downloading any applications, check to see what, if anything, it will cost. Even if the application is free, there may be data or air-time charges from your carrier, and there may be plans that can reduce those charges.  Flurry, a free service that works with several carriers, is both an e-mail application and an R.S.S. (for Really Simple Syndication) news reader, which you can use to subscribe to frequently updated content. You start by visiting www.flurry.com from your PC and entering your cellphone number, carrier name, e-mail address and password, and any R.S.S. feeds you wish to subscribe to. The service then sends a text message to your phone with a link for downloading the program.  The service works with most publicly available e-mail accounts, the company's chief executive, Sean Byrnes, said. It can also import up to 430 contacts from Outlook, Gmail and any other program or service that can export standard comma separated values, or CSV, files. You can also dial a phone number from that contact list.  Google recently started offering a free cellphone version of its popular Gmail service. If you have signed up for a Gmail account, you can download the application by pointing your cellphone browser to gmail.com/app. You enter your Gmail user name and password, and a few minutes later you are reading your mail. You can also compose and respond to mail and bring up your Gmail contact list.  Yahoo is conducting a public beta test of its free Go 2.0 service, which has numerous applications, including a phone-centric Internet search tool. You tell it where you are (a satellite-based locator will be available later) and it can find nearby restaurants, movie show times, stores and services and display a map to your destination. Because it is a downloaded application (at mobile.yahoo.com), it is faster than using a Web page, but it can also link you to Web pages through your phone's browser.  Yahoo Go also gives you access to Yahoo e-mail synchronized with your Web account. Mail is searchable, and you can display JPEG graphic files. You can track your stock portfolio, follow sports teams and get weather reports. You can also connect to a Flickr photo account to see or share photos from the road. Yahoo Go works with a limited number of phones from Cingular, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, Alltel, Telus and Rogers.  You're not going to find Microsoft Outlook on a run-of-the-mill cellphone. But with SoonR, a free application (at www.soonr.com) that runs in your cellphone's browser, you can use your phone to gain access to data from Outlook and other programs running on a PC or Mac.  You can view thumbnails of Word and Excel files, and Windows users can read, respond, compose and send Outlook e-mail. You can make calls from your Outlook contact list and consult and update Outlook's calendar. The files and programs are not on the phone -- you are using the phone for remote access to your home or office computer, and any changes you make on the phone show up on the PC.  You can remotely use most popular PC and Mac desktop search programs and forward files through your computer's broadband connection. You can even run the Internet phone service Skype on your PC from your cellphone.  Many of today's phones make use of the satellite-based Global Positioning System, mainly to help responders find you in an emergency, but the technology can also be tapped for location-based services, like turning your phone into a portable navigation device with turn-by-turn maps and audible directions through the phone's speaker.  I test-drove both the TeleNav service, which works with select phones from most carriers, and Verizon's VZ Navigator. Both are $10 a month. VZ Navigator can also be bought for $2.99 a day. Both use the phone network to provide directions, maps and points of interest that are updated on an ongoing basis. They have a ''points of interest'' database with millions of listings. TeleNav also has a ''gas by price'' feature that taps into an online database of gas station prices to lead you to the cheapest gas in your area.  So instead of lusting over that palmtop or Apple's highly anticipated iPhone, reach into your pocket and see what that phone of yours has to offer. You might just be carrying around a poor man's BlackBerry -- minus the keyboard.  BASICS",

            "fulltext": "Getting Graphic With Vista  Q. When shopping for a new computer, what kind of graphics card will be necessary to run Microsoft's Windows Vista?  A. The Windows Vista operating system, due at the end of the month for consumers, will be available in several versions with a range of system requirements, so your graphics-card needs will vary. Most hardware makers are labeling new computers as either Vista Capable to run the basic version, or Vista Premium Ready for a PC that can handle more Vista features.  To run the low-end Vista Home Basic version of the system, Microsoft states that a compatible PC needs to have at least an 800-megahertz processor, 512 megabytes of system memory and a graphics processor that can run the DirectX 9 multimedia software and has at least 32 megabytes of graphics memory.  While these hardware requirements are designed for the simplest version of Vista, they are not enough to display Windows Aero, its sophisticated graphical interface. Windows Aero -- which works with the Vista Home Premium, Vista Business, Vista Enterprise and Vista Ultimate editions of the system -- features shimmering effects like translucent windows and 3-D graphics.  According to Microsoft, a Windows Aero-compatible graphics card must be able to handle DirectX 9, Pixel Shader 2.0 technology and support 32 bits per pixel for color depth. The card needs at least 128 megabytes of graphics memory (although 256 megabytes of dedicated graphics memory is often recommended) and be able to run the Windows Display Driver Model software. Also known as W.D.D.M., that is the code that lets Vista and the graphics card communicate properly.  The Windows Vista home page of Microsoft's site has the full system requirements at www.microsoft.com/windowsvista.  Many PC makers now have areas of their Web sites devoted to Vista systems and information (www.dell.com/vista, for example) and may be helpful for research. For those looking to upgrade existing computers, graphics-card manufacturers like Nvidia (www.nvidia.com) and ATI (ati.amd.com) detail their product specifications on their Web sites and tell which cards work best with Microsoft's new system.  Voice Quality On the Internet  Q. Is there a way to make VoIP phone calls sound smoother, with fewer gaps in the audio?  A. Voice-over-Internet protocol, or VoIP, is technology that converts a phone conversation into data that can travel over a computer network -- and uses the Internet's cables instead of the telephone company's wires to carry the chat.  VoIP can be used for free computer-to-computer audio calls with software like Skype (www.skype.com). Many companies also offer residential and business VoIP phone plans that work pretty much like standard telephone service except for the use of Internet networking to carry the calls.  One factor that can affect call quality is network traffic. If your home or office network is being used to upload, download or stream a lot of data while you are trying to talk over your VoIP connection, the audio quality of the call may suffer from the lack of available bandwidth. Most VoIP services require a broadband Internet connection.  Call fidelity may vary by VoIP provider, and several consumer-oriented product sites and magazines have compared the different services for value and call quality. Consumer Reports has tested VoIP service, and sites like ConsumerSearch (www.consumersearch.com) have also done VoIP roundups.  New Background For a Mac Desktop  Q. How do I make my Mac automatically change its desktop background?  A. In recent versions of Mac OS X, you can set the computer to change its desktop background image at specified intervals in the System Preferences area. To get there, go to the Apple menu to System Preferences. Click on the Desktop & Screen Saver icon and click the Desktop tab.  In the dialog box, you can select a folder of photos or iPhoto album to use as background images. Put a check in the box next to ''Change picture'' and use the drop-down menu to select the length of time to display each image.  J. D. BIERSDORFER  Q & A",

            "fulltext": "After falling behind Google in Internet search and advertising, Yahoo is trying to remain No. 1 in the battle to deliver information and online services to mobile phones.  Yahoo's latest weapon is software that will let users find information like weather, news, stock quotes and sports scores more quickly on their cellphones. The software, called Go for Mobile 2.0, was unveiled Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, just as Google announced a partnership to put its own mobile software on Samsung cellphones.  Internet services on mobile phones remain a tiny market today, especially in the United States. But industry analysts and Internet companies believe they will eventually outgrow the market for computer-based Internet services as the capabilities of cellphones and the bandwidth of wireless networks improve rapidly.  ''We view the mobile Internet today as entering an era where the PC-based Internet was in '96 or '97,'' said Steve Boom, Yahoo's senior vice president for broadband and mobile. ''It is just on the cusp of taking off.''  For Yahoo, securing a leading position in that market is especially important. The company has struggled over the last year, as Google solidified its lead in search and leaped ahead in online video by acquiring YouTube. Yahoo has also been criticized as lacking initiative and being slow to capitalize on Internet trends like social networking, now dominated by MySpace and Facebook.  Yahoo's introduction of mobile software was reported Monday in The Wall Street Journal. The software, a revamped version of technology that the company introduced last year, makes it easy to move among various online services providing news, sports scores, maps, weather, movies, photos and e-mail. The free ad-supported services will be tailored to match a user's settings, like ZIP code and stock preferences, on Yahoo's existing online services.  The software will also be equipped with a search service, oneSearch, that will interpret a user's intent and deliver results accordingly. For instance, when a user searches for a sports team, the service will make a bet that the user is interested in the latest scores, a team profile and news related to the team, and return those first. More general Web links, like those returned in typical Internet searches, will be de-emphasized.  ''It's the kind of thing that Yahoo very much needs to extend further onto the mobile platform,'' said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm based in Bethesda, Md.  The service is already available on about 70 handset models and is expected to be on some 400 devices by the end of the year, Mr. Boom said. Yahoo has signed agreements with handset makers to preload or distribute the software. Yahoo is also encouraging users to download the software directly onto their devices.  Yahoo's mobile services were used by 6.8 percent of cellphone users in the United States in October, according to Telephia, a research firm. That made Yahoo, whose most popular wireless service is e-mail, the No. 1 mobile Internet company. But in mobile search, Google already tops Yahoo, according to Telephia.  Google said its cellphone search, e-mail and map products would be preloaded on Samsung phones. Deep Nishar, Google's director of wireless products and strategy, said the company's mobile search service already emphasized results that users typically want, like sports scores and movie times and locations.  To succeed, both companies will need to secure cooperation from wireless carriers, which could prove a challenge for some time as several offer competing services, said Julie Ask, an analyst at Jupiter Research.  Yahoo said some overseas carriers had agreed to support its services. Mr. Boom said it was ''a matter of time'' before American carriers followed suit. As an incentive, Yahoo is offering to share revenue from any advertising on the system, he said.  Ms. Ask noted that, for now, most cellphone advertising consists of text messages sent directly to users, and that ad revenues from mobile search and Web browsing are minuscule.",

Mr. Gillitt, a graphic designer from Alameda, Calif., is exasperated by his high-definition cable box, made by the technology giant Motorola and leased to him by his local cable provider, Comcast. The $10-a-month device, he says, has a poorly designed electronic program guide and responds slowly, or not at all, to commands from the remote control.  ''Paying for something this awful hurts,'' Mr. Gillitt said.  For many Americans, the cable box -- still commonly called the set-top box, though it is now too big to balance on top of increasingly thin TVs -- may be the most disappointing piece of technology in their homes. As inventions like TiVo and YouTube alter the way people watch and control video, the traditional box has largely failed to keep up.  Now that is beginning to change.  At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, makers of set-top boxes exhibited devices with a host of new features: more hard-disk space for storing digitally recorded TV shows, easier-to-navigate program guides, connections to Web sites, DVD burners and video games.  The box manufacturers and the cable operators like Comcast, Cox and Time Warner Cable that they sell to, have an age-old motivation for improving their products: fear. New competitors are flooding into the TV business, including the industry's rivals in the telephone business, and the computer kingpins Microsoft and Apple.  Consumers can buy those alternatives at regular retail outlets, including the newest high-definition version of TiVo. It sells for $800 (with a $20 monthly fee) and can replace the box that cable and satellite providers lease to customers, instead of merely sitting on top of it and adding to living room clutter.  Cable operators are being forced to play nice with these new entrants. The Federal Communications Commission has set a deadline of July 1 for all cable operators to make their services work with boxes from all third-party manufacturers, and last week it rejected a request from Comcast to extend the deadline.  ''Set-top boxes are becoming the central piece of equipment in the home for accessing entertainment and information,'' said Joshua Goldman, chief executive of Akimbo, a Silicon Valley start-up trying to bring programming to the TV over the Internet. ''Consumers will buy their own device if they feel like they are not getting the services they want from their television operators.''  For decades, the cable industry did not worry much about introducing new features into their typically black set-top boxes. They faced little competition in their local markets and bought their equipment from one of two companies: General Instruments, which was purchased by Motorola in 2000, and Scientific Atlanta, acquired by Cisco Systems in 2005.  Both companies build TV boxes according to the specifications of cable companies, who lease them to customers and then make their money on monthly subscriptions. Because they are essentially giving the boxes away, the industry's focus, not surprisingly, is on keeping the cost of the equipment low.  But now new players are offering more sophisticated alternatives to cable boxes. Over the last two years, 30 million personal computers have been sold with Media Center software from Microsoft, which enhances video viewing on the PC, making it more like a television. The computers come with a remote control and can pause and fast-forward through video.  Many of those PCs can now replace set-top boxes, thanks to a federal law passed over a decade ago that requires cable operators to sell credit-card-size devices called CableCards. These cards can plug into a Media Center PC, or other consumer electronics appliances like DVD players, allowing them to receive regular cable channels.  Last week, Apple also joined the fray with Apple TV, a slick silver box that connects to the television and displays programs and movies that have been downloaded from iTunes. It goes on sale next month for $299.  The message to cable companies and their equipment vendors is clear: if they want to keep up, they must build a better cable box.  They appear to be listening. At the Las Vegas show, just as many visitors swarmed around Motorola's new set-top boxes as its latest mobile phones. The company showed a line of new boxes compatible with high-definition TV, with one-third more hard-disk space than its previous models, like the clumsy device Mr. Gillitt has under his TV.  The new boxes are designed to offer greater control over the television. For example, one new feature Motorola is promoting is called ''program restart.'' If cable customers miss a show by a few minutes and do not record it, they can click a button and get the cable company to retransmit it directly to them, instantly. Time Warner Cable is currently testing the service in San Antonio.  Padmasree Warrior, the chief technology officer of Motorola, said consumers now demand more from their televisions, largely thanks to TiVo, which has forced the cable companies to ask suppliers for more innovative set-top boxes. ''Enough people are experienced with time-shifting that there's a demand that the industry dynamics change,'' Ms. Warrior said.  Across the showroom floor, Scientific Atlanta executives agreed that the old featureless TV tuner was quickly becoming a relic. Among its new boxes, the company showed off one called the MCP-100: a silver set-top box with a digital video recorder and one surprising new feature: a slot for DVDs. In addition to getting live TV, the device can play movies and burn programs and movies onto discs. It is now being tested by cable companies.  Scientific Atlanta is also building Internet connections into all its boxes, so consumers can get programming from the Web in addition to the traditional ways, by cable or satellite.  ''There's a growing need for high-quality video that goes right to where it's supposed to, the television, and not to the PC, where only college kids are looking at it,'' said Robert C. McIntryre, Scientific Atlanta's chief technology officer.  The cable companies and their equipment vendors must adapt to the Internet age quickly, because soon customers will have more choices than ever. Telephone companies like AT&T and Verizon are investing heavily to bury fiber optic cables in most major cities and roll out their own TV offerings.  Because the telephone companies deliver television using Internet standards and typically package it with telephone and Internet service, they say they can offer consumers more choices and control over the viewing experience. AT&T, for example, showed off a set-top box at the Las Vegas show that received four different streams of programming (compared with most new digital cable boxes, which receive only two). That allows a customer to watch a program live while simultaneously recording three others.  One new feature that AT&T was showing, called picture-in-picture browsing, or PIP, lets a TV viewer channel surf on a small screen while continuing to watch another program on the rest of the screen.  AT&T hopes to have its TV service, called uVerse, accessible to 19 million homes by the end of next year. If it can pull it off, it would position AT&T as a serious rival to cable and satellite television providers.  All of these established companies also have to watch out for smaller rivals with their own set-top box innovations. TiVo's Series3 HD Digital Media Recorder, which went on sale last fall at electronics stores like Best Buy, is CableCard-ready, which means buyers can plug in a card from their local cable operator and use it as a substitute for a cable box.  Another technology start-up at the show, Digeo, exhibited its new Moxi service, a set-top box with digital video recorder that it plans to start selling in the latter half of this year. The Moxi also works with a CableCard and comes with smaller optional ''Moxi mates,'' which buyers can connect to the other TVs in their homes. Those televisions will then have access to the programming received by and recorded on the primary set-top box.  Digeo's chief executive, Mike Fidler, said increased competition was ushering in a renaissance in set-top-box design. ''Companies can now come in with innovative products that change the consumer experience and bring a whole new level of enjoyment to television,'' Mr. Fidler said.",

            "fulltext": "Importing Contacts From Eudora  Q. Is there a way to transfer a large address book from Eudora to another e-mail program?  A. Relocating your Eudora e-mail address book is possible in most situations. The exact steps will vary based on the version of Eudora you have, the operating system you have and the new e-mail program you want to use.  In many cases, you can simply use an importing tool from your new e-mail software to pull in the address book from your Eudora program. Microsoft Outlook Express and Mozilla Thunderbird are two programs with such an option.  Some versions of Eudora use a full-feature address book that can hold more information than just a name and an e-mail address, offering fields for notes, photos and multiple mailing addresses as well. If your Eudora address book is fairly detailed, you may want to consider getting conversion software that can move all of this information more accurately between mail programs.  Address Magic by Connected Software (www.connectedsw.com/AddressMagic.php) is one such utility for Windows. The eMailman Web site, which devotes itself to all things e-mail, has a page of links to other address-book conversion programs for Mac and Windows systems at www.emailman.com/conversion.  Untangling A Mess of Cables  Q. What can I do about the tangle of computer cables on and behind the desk?  A. If you find your desk area has become knotted with snaking cables, there are a couple of approaches to untangling the problem.  One way to cut down on cables is to use wireless peripherals. For example, many mice, keyboards, speakers and other computer hardware items now come in Bluetooth versions that use radio signals to transmit data between devices instead of a cable. This option, however, can be expensive, and you may not be able to find wireless products for all of your hardware needs.  A cable-management system is a cheaper option. Companies like Cable-Safe (www.cable-safe.com) offer several products for tying down (or tying up) the power cords and wires coming out of the computer.  Office supply stores like Staples (www.staples.com) and Office Depot (www.officedepot.com) also sell a variety of inexpensive cable ties, clips and sleeves to keep cords neatly bound and under control. Threading your cables through plastic tubing (like the kind sold for aquariums) is another option, and is sometimes favored by those with pets who like to nibble on computer cables.  Adding Titles To Songs in iTunes  Q. Sometimes when I try to import music from a CD into iTunes, the computer lists the songs as ''Track 01, Track 02,'' etc. Is there any way I can manually add the information for each song?  A. The iTunes program pulls down album information over the Internet from the Gracenote CD Database (also known as the CDDB). If you are not online when you import the songs from the CD, iTunes cannot download the titles. You may also see the ''Track 01'' listing if you are connected to the Internet but there is no information about that particular album in the database.  If you imported the tracks when you were offline, you can go back and look for the song information the next time you fire up your Internet connection. Once you are online, go to iTunes and click on the nameless tracks you want to identify.  On the Windows version of the program, holding down the Shift key lets you select multiple tracks listed next to each other, and holding down the Control key while you click lets you select nonadjacent songs in a list. (On the Mac, the Shift and Command keys provide the same functions.)  Once you have selected your tracks, go to the Advanced menu and select ''Get CD Track Names.'' If iTunes can find the album, it should apply the song information to your selected tracks.  If all else fails, you can manually type in the information for each song. One way to do this is to select the song or album you want to change and choose Get Info from the File menu. Click the Info tab and make your changes. If you are editing a whole album's worth of tracks, click the next button to go to the next track and click the O.K. button when finished.  J. D. BIERSDORFER  Q & A",

Vitamin B12 reduces the blood levels of homocysteine, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the reduction apparently has no effect on survival.  The review covered 12 studies with 16,598 participants who had pre-existing illness. All of the studies showed a reduction in homocysteine levels in people who took folate supplements, but there was no correlation between the amount of reduction in blood levels of homocysteine and the risk of heart attacks, coronary heart disease, stroke or mortality from any cause, and no difference between those who took folate supplements and the participants in control groups who took none.  ''We haven't found any magical supplement pills to prevent cardiovascular disease,'' said Dr. Lydia A. Bazzano, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.  ''The things people have to do are hard; they have to quit smoking, exercise, lose weight, eat properly,'' Dr. Bazzano continued. ''This means getting omega-3 fatty acids and a well-balanced diet in terms of carbohydrates and proteins. And eating fruits and vegetables is always good. No one has been able to contradict that yet.''  The study, published in the Dec. 13 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, covered only people who were already ill with vascular disease, but the authors wrote that no randomized, controlled trials have shown a beneficial effect of B12 supplements in preventing vascular disease in healthy people, either.

            "fulltext": "Moderate alcohol consumption appears to pose little danger to men with high blood pressure, and may even reduce their risk of heart attack, according to a study published Jan. 2.  Beginning in 1986, researchers followed 11,711 male health professionals previously given diagnoses of hypertension, using a questionnaire about diet, alcohol consumption and medical history every four years. The study, which followed the men through 2002, appears in The Annals of Internal Medicine.  During 16 years of follow-up, the study recorded 653 heart attacks, of which 279 were fatal. There was little difference between abstainers and those who consumed up to 4.9 grams of alcohol per day. But after adjusting for age, smoking, the use of blood pressure medication and other factors, men who consumed 15 to 29.9 grams a day -- the equivalent of one to two drinks -- lowered their risk for fatal heart attack by 30 percent. The more alcohol they consumed, the more they reduced their risk, by up to 60 percent for those who consumed more than 50 grams a day.  ''In no way does this suggest that people should be drinking more than three drinks a day,'' said Eric B. Rimm, a co-author of the study and an associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''But the results do suggest that people who have hypertension have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease if they drink moderately.''  Alcohol consumption also lowered the risk for nonfatal heart attack, but it did not affect the risk of death from cardiovascular disease or death from all causes.  The authors acknowledge that their data depends on self-reports, which are not always reliable. Dr. Rimm received an honorarium two years ago from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.

Tympanostomy, or the insertion of tubes to drain the fluid and improve hearing, is one of the most common pediatric operations and is generally believed to help prevent developmental problems. But this study, published on Jan. 18 in The New England Journal of Medicine, suggests that tubes in otherwise healthy children has no effect on development through age 11.  The researchers studied 429 children younger than 2 months with persistent episodes of fluid in the middle ear. The children were randomly assigned in a clinical trial to undergo tympanostomy promptly or six to nine months later. At the same time, researchers randomly selected a comparison group of 241 children who had persistent fluid in their ears but were not eligible for the clinical trial; almost none of those children received ear tubes.  Examinations at ages 9 to 11 with tests of hearing, speech and academic skills showed no significant difference between the children who received early tube placement and those who received later placement. Among the children not eligible for the trial, correlations between the duration of episodes of fluid in the ear for various periods in the first three years of life and developmental outcomes at ages 9 to 11 were generally insignificant.  ''These findings do not apply to children with acute infections,'' said Dr. Jack L. Paradise, the lead author and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh. ''But with children whose only problem is fluid in the ear, we should be conservative and wait at least a year before considering tubes.''  VITAL SIGNS: CHILD CARE",

Researchers gave 15 volunteers 1,000 milligrams of Echinacea purpurea daily for 10 days. They collected stool samples before the supplementation, and at 10 days and 17 to 18 days after the volunteers had stopped taking the herb, then analyzed the samples for six types of bacteria. The study was published in December in The Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics.  After controlling for other diet variables, the scientists found significant increases in microbial counts for Bacteroides, Bacteroides fragilis, and total aerobic bacteria. There was no effect on enteric bacteria, enterococci, Lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, or total anaerobic bacteria.  ''This changes the balance of the normal bacterial fauna,'' said Jerald C.

Researchers compared blood levels of LDL cholesterol in 124 Parkinson's patients with a control group of 112 of their healthy spouses. Compared with people in the highest one-quarter in LDL levels, those in the lower 75 percent were two to three and a half times as likely to suffer from Parkinson's. There was no association between Parkinson's and levels of HDL cholesterol.  Normally, having a low LDL level is a healthy sign. But does this mean that having a higher LDL is actually a good thing? Absolutely not, said Dr. Xuemei Huang, the lead author of the study.  ''If a person is healthy with a cholesterol in the middle range, and no family history of heart disease, radically lowering cholesterol may not be necessary,'' she said. ''But at the same time, we're not urging anyone to change his diet or medication based on this finding.'' Dr. Huang is a Parkinson's expert and a neurologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.  The findings, based on retrospective data, could not demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between a low level of LDL and Parkinson's, the authors said. The paper was published online Dec. 18 in the journal Movement Disorders.  Men and women in the study who used cholesterol-lowering drugs were about a third as likely to have Parkinson's as those who did not use the drugs. This finding led researchers to suggest that testing the effect of statins on neurodegenerative disease with a much larger sample of patients could be useful.  VITAL SIGNS: AT RISK",

Researchers followed 965 Medicare recipients 65 or older for an average of six years, administering diet questionnaires to estimate their intake of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, and performing medical examinations at about 18-month intervals. Members of the study group lived in northern Manhattan, were largely Hispanic and black, and had high levels of diabetes, hypertension and other vascular risk factors. Alzheimer's developed in 192 of them.  After adjusting for age, hypertension, current smoking and other variables, those in the highest one-quarter in total folate intake, from both diet and supplements, were 50 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's than those in the lowest one-quarter. There was no significant association of Alzheimer's risk with dietary folate alone, or with vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 intake.  Dr. Jos\u00e9 A. Luchsinger, the lead author and an assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at Columbia, said there was nothing definitive in these results.  ''This study is observational, not a clinical trial,'' he said. ''It builds evidence and suggests hypotheses, but should not be used to recommend treatment.''  The authors, writing in the January issue of The Archives of Neurology, suggest that folate lowers blood levels of homocysteine, which may decrease the risk of brain atrophy.

But a new study suggests that combat veterans who suffer from the disorder may also be at increased risk for heart attacks and fatal coronary heart disease.  The study is the first to suggest that the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or P.T.S.D., may actually be a cause of heart disease. And the more severe the symptoms of P.T.S.D., the researchers found, the greater the risk for disease.  The analysis was based on data from 1,946 veterans participating in a continuing study. The men, whose average age at the start of the study was about 62, had no pre-existing heart problems. Beginning in 1986, they were followed for more than 10 years, with periodic physical examinations and the updating of their medical records. Two self-administered scales were used to assess the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and to estimate their severity.  Over the course of the study, which appears in the January issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, 255 of the men developed either nonfatal heart attacks, fatal coronary heart disease or angina pectoris, the chest pain associated with heart problems.  The number and severity of the veterans' symptoms were significantly associated with nonfatal heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease, and somewhat less strongly linked to angina.  These results, the authors suggest, mean that people with more symptoms of the stress disorder are not simply prone to reporting aches and pains but actually at higher risk for disease.  ''In this sample, symptom levels were actually low to moderate,'' said Laura D. Kubzansky, the lead author and an assistant professor of society, human development and health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''So the fact that we have evidence of risk at these levels means that at even higher levels of symptomatology, where people might be significantly distressed and meet diagnostic criteria for P.T.S.D., you would expect to see even higher levels of risk.''  The exact mechanism through which post-traumatic stress might affect heart health is not known, but some researchers have suggested that the stress-caused release of hormones called catecholamines may lead to injury of the coronary arteries by altering blood flow or setting off chemical changes in the body. These hormones may also encourage the release of fatty acids that can be harmful to the heart.  The new study, the authors say, is the first to demonstrate an association between heart disease and symptoms of post-traumatic stress while controlling for many of the variables that might affect risk, including depression, smoking, a family history of heart disease, cholesterol levels and alcohol consumption.  The researchers acknowledge that the study's findings pertain largely to older white men who served in the military and therefore cannot be generalized to women, nonwhite men or civilians. Also, the data on psychological symptoms (although not on heart disease) depend on self-reports by the veterans rather than on interviews by doctors, and therefore may be less reliable.  The fact that the researchers determined the presence of post-traumatic stress before the onset of any heart disease strengthens the findings, they said, because it eliminates the problems of recall bias, when people erroneously attribute an illness to some unconnected event or anxiety in the past.  For a long time, Dr. Kubzansky said, people have assumed that those with anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder were simply more likely than others to report pain, and that the pain might not be real.  But the new findings, she continued, ''suggest that there are significant cardiotoxic effects of these disorders beyond just a sense of discomfort or pain.  ''We should be concerned about P.T.S.D. because it's a bad outcome in and of itself,'' she said. ''But this makes an even stronger argument that we should pay attention to those who have it to make sure they don't develop further problems down the road.''",

Researchers randomly assigned 818 men and women ages 50 to 70 to take a daily oral dose of 800 micrograms of folic acid or a placebo. All the subjects, who were otherwise healthy, had elevated blood levels of homocysteine, which has in previous studies been associated with poor cognitive performance.  All the subjects took five tests of mental functioning. At the beginning of the study, there was no significant difference in the scores between the groups. But at the end, after controlling for cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass, smoking status and other variables, the folic acid group performed significantly better on three of the five mental tests, and their average for all tests was significantly higher.

Researchers randomly selected 5,008 people older than 50 and followed them for five years. At the start of the study, they interviewed the subjects about medications and general health. The subjects filled out yearly questionnaires reporting fractures caused by falling from a bed, chair or standing height. (A co-author of the study has received grants and honorariums from several drug companies.)  One hundred and thirty-seven people, or 2.7 percent of the subjects, were daily users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, a rate similar to that of the general populations of the United States and Canada. After controlling for the use of other psychotropic medicines, age, sex, education, height, weight, smoking status and other variables, daily users of S.S.R.I.'s were 2.1 times as likely to suffer fractures as those who did not use the medicine. The study  appears in the Jan. 22 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.  ''We're not recommending that people stop their S.S.R.I.'s,'' said Dr. David Goltzman, a professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal and the senior author of the study. ''But people should realize that this is a risk and that they might want to undertake lifestyle changes like participating in exercise and making sure their diet is appropriate in calcium and vitamin D.''  Using S.S.R.I.'s was also associated with an increased risk of falls and with decreased mineral bone density. But after controlling for falls and low bone density, the risk of fracture persisted. The scientists speculated that other pathways leading to impaired bone quality might be at work.  VITAL SIGNS: HAZARDS",

            "fulltext": "Bosch has found the radiation victim's Toyota in an alley not far from the overlook, and inside it, many objects asociated with Stanley Kent's murder, particularly the cesium. In the process, however, Bosch, too, has been exposed to the radiation.  The car jerked forward as Walling pulled out of the alley and into southbound traffic on Cahuenga.  ''I'm taking you back to Queen of Angels so Dr. Gardner can have a look at you,'' she said. ''Just hang in there for me, Bosch.''  He knew that the last-name endearments were probably about to come to an end. He pointed toward the left-turn lane that led onto Barham Boulevard.  ''Never mind the hospital,'' he said. ''Take me back to the Kent house.''  ''What?''  ''I'll get checked out later. Go to the Kent house. Here's the turn.''  She slipped into the left-turn lane.  ''What are you telling me, that that little fainting spell back there was -- ''  ''I had to get you away from the crime scene and away from Brenner so I could check this out and talk to you.''  ''Check what out? Talk about what? Do you realize what you just did? I thought I was saving your life. Now Brenner or one of those other guys will take the credit for the recovery. Thanks a lot. That was my crime scene.''  He opened his jacket and pulled out the rolled and folded-over yoga poster.  ''Don't worry about it,'' he said. ''You can get the credit for the arrests. You just might not want it.''  He opened the poster, letting the top half flop over his knees. He was interested in only the bottom half.  ''Dhanurasana,'' he said.  Walling glanced over at him and then down at the poster.  ''Would you start telling me what's going on?''  ''Alice Kent practices yoga. I saw the mats in the workout room at the house.''  ''I saw them, too. So what?''  ''Did you see the sun discoloration on the wall where a picture or a calendar or maybe a poster had been taken down?''  ''Yes, I saw it.''  Bosch held up the poster.  ''I'm betting that we go in there and this will be a perfect fit. This is a poster Gonzalves found with the cesium.''  ''And what will that mean -- if it's a perfect fit?''  ''It will mean Alice Kent conspired to kill her husband, and if it hadn't been for Digiberto Gonzalves, it would have been a perfect crime.''  Walling shook her head dismissively.  ''Come on, Harry. Are you saying she conspired with international terrorists to kill her husband in exchange for the cesium? I can't believe I am even doing this. I need to get back to the crime scene.''  She started checking her mirrors, getting ready to make a U-turn. They were going up Lake Hollywood Drive now and would be at the house in two minutes.  ''No, keep going. We're almost there. Alice Kent conspired with someone, but it wasn't a terrorist. The cesium being dumped in the trash proves that. You said it yourself, there is no way that Moby and Elfayed would steal this stuff to just dump it. So what does that tell you? This wasn't a heist. It actually was a murder. The cesium was just a red herring. Moby and Elfayed? They were part of the misdirection. And this poster will help prove it.''  ''How?''  ''Dhanurasana, the rocking bow.''  He held the poster up so she could glance at the yoga pose depicted in the bottom corner. It showed a woman with her arms behind her back, holding her ankles and creating a bow with the front of her body. She looked as if she were hogtied.  Walling glanced back at the curving road and then took another long look at the poster and the pose.  ''We go into the house and see if this fits that space on the wall,'' Bosch said. ''If it fits, that means she and the killer took it off the wall because they didn't want to risk that we might see it and connect it with what happened to her.''  ''It's a stretch, Harry. A huge one.''  ''Not when you put it in context.''  ''Which you, of course, can do.''  ''As soon as we get to the house.''  ''Hope you still have a key.''  ''You bet I do.''  Walling turned onto Arrowhead Drive and punched the accelerator. But after a block she took her foot off, slowed down and shook her head again.  ''This is ridiculous. She gave us the name Moby. There is no way she could have known he was in this country. And then up on the overlook, your own witness said that the shooter called out to Allah as he pulled the trigger. How can -- ''  ''Let's try the poster on the wall. If it fits, I'll lay the whole thing out for you. I promise. If it doesn't fit, then I will quit bothering you with it.''  She relented and drove the remaining block to the Kent house without another word. There was no longer a bureau car sitting out front. Bosch guessed that it was all hands on deck at the cesium-recovery scene.  ''Thank God I don't have to deal with Maxwell again,'' he said.  Walling didn't even smile.  Bosch got out with the poster and his file containing the crime-scene photos. He used Stanley Kent's keys to open the front door, and they proceeded to the workout room. They took positions on either side of the rectangular discoloration, and Bosch unrolled the poster. They each took a side and held the top corners of the poster to the top corners of the mark. Bosch put his other hand on the center of the poster and flattened it against the wall. The poster was a perfect fit.  Rachel immediately let go of her side and headed out of the room.  ''I'll be in the living room. I can't wait to hear you put this together.''  Bosch rolled the poster up and followed. Walling took a seat in the same chair Bosch put Maxwell in a few hours earlier. He remained standing in front of her.  ''The fear was that the poster could be a tip-off,'' he said. ''Some smart agent or detective would see the rocking-bow pose and start thinking, This woman does yoga, maybe she could handle being hogtied like that. Maybe it was her idea, maybe she did it to help sell the misdirection. So they couldn't take the chance. The poster had to go. It went into the Dumpster with the cesium, the gun and everything else they used. If you get your people out there to check that line of Dumpsters, you'll find the rest -- the Coke-bottle silencer, the ski mask, the gloves, the first set of snap ties, every -- ''  ''The first set of snap ties?''  ''That's right. I'll get to that.''  Walling looked unimpressed.  ''You better get to a lot of it. Because there are big gaps in this thing, man. What about the name Moby? What about the citing of Allah by the shooter? What -- ''  Bosch held up a hand.  ''Just hold on,'' he said. ''I need some water. My throat is raw from all of this talking.''  He went into the kitchen, remembering that he saw bottles of chilled water in the refrigerator while searching the kitchen earlier.  ''You want anything?'' he called out.  ''No,'' she called back. ''It's not our house, remember?''  He opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle of water and drank half of it while standing in front of the open door. He then went back out to the living room, where Rachel was waiting for the story. Once again, he remained standing.  ''O.K., when was it that you captured the terrorist known as Moby on video at the port?''  ''What does -- ''  ''Please, just answer the question.''  ''Aug. 12.''  ''O.K., Aug. 12. Then what, some sort of alert went out through the bureau and Homeland Security?''  She nodded.  ''Not for a while, though,'' she said. ''It took almost a month of video analysis to confirm it was Nassar and Elfayed. I wrote the bulletin. It went out Sept. 9 as a confirmed domestic sighting.''  ''Out of curiosity, why didn't you go public with it?''  ''Because we have -- actually, I can't tell you.''  ''You just did. You must have someone or someplace where you think these two might show up under surveillance. If you go public, they might just go underground and never show up again.''  ''Can we go back to your story, please?''  ''Fine. So the bulletin went out Sept. 9. That was the day the plan to kill Stanley Kent began.''  Walling folded her arms across her chest and just stared at him. Bosch thought that maybe she was beginning to see where he was going with the story, and she didn't like it.  ''It works best if you start from the end and go backward,'' Bosch said. ''She gave you the name Moby. How could she have gotten that name?''  ''She overheard one of them calling the other one that name.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''No, she told you she overheard it. But if she was lying, how would she know the name to lie about it? Just coincidence that she gives the nickname of a guy who was just discovered in the country -- in L.A. County, no less? I don't think so, Rachel, and neither do you.''  ''O.K., so you're saying that somebody in the bureau or another agency that received the F.B.I. bulletin gave her the name.''  ''That's right. He gave her the name so she could come out with it while being questioned by the F.B.I.'s master interrogator. That one name would then send this whole thing down the wrong road with the F.B.I. and everybody else chasing after terrorists who had nothing to do with it.''  ''He?''  ''I'm getting to that now. You are right, anybody who got a look at that bulletin would have been able to give her that name. My guess is that would be a lot of people. A lot of people just in L.A. alone. So how would we narrow it down to one?''  ''You tell me.''  Bosch opened the bottle and drank the rest of the water. He held the empty bottle in his hand as he continued.  ''You narrow it down by continuing to go backward. Where would Alice Kent's life have intersected with one of those people in the agencies who knew about Moby?''  ''That could be anywhere with those kind of parameters. It could've happened when she was buying fertilizer for her roses.''  ''Then narrow the parameters. Where would she have intersected with someone who knew about Moby but also knew that her husband had access to the sort of radioactive materials Moby might be interested in?''  She shook her head in a disdainful way.  ''Nowhere. It would take a monumental coincidence to -- ''  She stopped when it came to her. There was enlightenment and shock as she fully understood where Bosch was going.  ''My partner and I visited the Kents to warn them a year ago. I guess what you're saying is that that makes me a suspect.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''I said 'he,' remember? You didn't come here alone.''  Her eyes fired when she registered the implication.  ''That's ridiculous. There's no way. I can't believe you would. . . . ''  She didn't finish, as her mind snagged on something, some memory or tell that undermined her trust and loyalty to her partner.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing.''  ''What?''  ''Look,'' she insisted, ''take my advice and tell no one this theory of yours. You're lucky you told me first. Because this makes you sound like some kind of crackpot with a vendetta. You have no evidence, no motive, no incriminating statements, nothing. You just have this thing you've spun out of . . . out of a yoga poster.''  ''There is no other explanation that fits with the facts. And I'm talking about the facts of the case. Not the fact that the bureau and Homeland Security and the rest of the federal government would love this to be a terrorism event so they can justify their existence and deflect criticism from other failings. Contrary to what you want to think, there is evidence and there are incriminating statements. If we put Alice Kent on a lie detector, you'll find out that everything she told me, you and the master interrogator downtown is a lie.''  Walling leaned forward and looked down at the floor.  ''That master interrogator you love deriding happened to be me.''  Bosch's mouth dropped open for a moment before he spoke.  ''Oh . . . well . . . then, sorry . . . but it doesn't matter. The point is, she is a master liar. She lied about everything, and now that we know the story, it will be easy to smoke her out.''  Walling got up from her seat and walked over to the front picture window. The vertical blinds were closed, but she split them with a finger and stared out into the street. Bosch could see her working the story over, grinding it down.  ''What about the witness?'' she asked without turning around. ''He heard the shooter yell, 'Allah.' Are you saying he's part of this?''  Now Bosch sat down and gently tried to clear his throat. It was burning and getting difficult to talk.  ''No, on that I think it's just a lesson in hearing what you want to hear. I plead guilty to not being much of a master interrogator myself. The kid told me that he heard the shooter yell it as he pulled the trigger. He said he wasn't sure but that it sounded like 'Allah,' and that, of course, worked with what I was thinking at the time.''  Walling came away from the window and sat down across from him. She folded her arms again. Bosch continued.  ''But how would he know it was the shooter and not the victim who yelled? He was more than 50 yards away. It was dark. How would he know that it wasn't Stanley Kent yelling out his last word before execution? The name of the woman he loved because he was about to die not even knowing that she'd betrayed him in the worst way.''  ''Alice.''  ''Exactly.''  Walling relaxed her arms and leaned forward. As body language went, it was a good sign. It told Bosch he was pushing through.  ''You said 'the first set of snap ties' before,'' she said. ''What were you talking about?''  Bosch nodded and handed her the file containing the crime-scene photos. He had saved the best for last.  ''Look at the photos,'' he said. ''What do you see?''  She opened the file and started looking at them. They depicted the master bedroom in the Kent house from all angles.  ''It's the master bedroom,'' she said. ''What am I missing?''  ''Exactly.''  ''What?''  ''It's what you don't see. There are no clothes in the shot. She told us they told her to take off her clothes and get on the bed. What are we supposed to believe, that they let her put the clothes away before they hogtied her? They let her put them in the hamper? Look at the last shot. It's the e-mail photo Stanley Kent got.''  Walling looked through the file until she found the printout of the photo. She stared intently at it. He saw recognition break in her eyes.  ''Now what do you see?''  ''The robe,'' she said excitedly. ''When we let her get dressed, she went to the closet to get her robe. There was no robe on that lounge chair!''  Bosch nodded, and they started trading the story back and forth.  ''What does that tell us?'' he asked. ''That these considerate terrorists hung the robe up in the closet for her after taking the photo?''  ''Or that maybe Mrs. Kent was tied up twice and the robe was moved in between?''  ''And look again at the picture. The clock on the bedside table is unplugged.''  ''Why?''  ''I don't know, but maybe they didn't want to worry about having any sort of time stamp on the photo. Maybe the first photo wasn't even taken yesterday. Maybe it came from a dry run two days ago or two weeks.''  Rachel nodded, and Bosch knew she was a believer.  ''She was tied up once for the photo and then once again for the rescue,'' she said.  ''Exactly. And that left her free to help carry out the plan on the overlook. She didn't kill her husband, but she was up there in the other car. And once Stanley was dead and the car was ditched and the cesium dumped, she and her partner came back home, and she was tied up all over again.''  ''She wasn't passed out when we got there,'' Walling said. ''That was an act and part of the plan. And her wetting the bed was a nice little touch to help sell it to us.''  There was no doubt now. Bosch had her. But then the shadow of concern and doubt moved across her face like a summer cloud.  ''What about motive?'' she asked. ''This is a federal agent we're talking about. To move on this we need everything, even motive. There can be nothing left open to chance.''  Bosch had been ready for the question.  ''You saw the motive. Alice Kent is a beautiful woman. Jack Brenner wanted her, and Stanley Kent was in the way of that.''  Walling's eyes widened in shock. Bosch pressed on with his case.  ''That's the motive, Rachel. You -- ''  ''But he -- ''  ''Let me just finish. It goes like this. You and your partner show up here that day last year to give the Kents the warning about his occupation. Some kind of vibe is exchanged between Alice and Jack. He gets interested, she gets interested. They meet on the sly for coffee or drinks or whatever. One thing leads to another. An affair begins, and it lasts, and then it lasts to the point that it's time to start thinking about doing something. Leaving the husband. Or getting rid of him because there's insurance and half a company at stake. That's enough motive right there, Rachel, and that's what this case is about. It's not about cesium or terrorism or anything else. It's sex and murder. That's all.''  She frowned and shook her head.  ''You don't know what you are talking about. Jack Brenner is married and has three children. That's why I wanted him as a partner. He's stable, boring and not interested. He wasn't -- ''  ''Every man is interested. It doesn't matter if they're married or how many kids they have.''  She spoke quietly.  ''Would you listen and let me finish now? You are wrong about Brenner. He never met Alice Kent before today. He wasn't my partner when I came here last year, and I never told you he was.''  Bosch was jolted by the news. He'd assumed that her current partner was her partner last year. He'd had Brenner's image locked and loaded in his mind as he had spun the story.  ''Then who was your partner?'' he asked.  ''I switched partners and hooked up with Jack after the start of the year. Basically, I was tired of my old partner coming on to me. I wanted to move on.''  ''Who was it, Rachel?''  She held his eyes for a long moment.  ''It was Cliff Maxwell.''

            "fulltext": "Instead of going to the hospital to get checked out, Bosch, along with Walling, has gone back to the Kent house, where Bosch has convinced her that the terrorist angle was meant to distract, the crime being a classic one of sex and murder: Alice Kent had conspired with Walling's partner to kill Stanley Kent. Except the partner wasn't Brenner, as Bosch had been thinking.  Harry Bosch almost laughed but was too shocked to do anything except shake his head. Rachel Walling was telling him that Cliff Maxwell, the agent Bosch had tangled with twice in the last few hours, was Alice Kent's partner in murder.  ''I can't believe this,'' he finally said. ''Three hours ago I had the killer handcuffed on the floor right here!''  Walling looked mortified by the realization that the murder of Stanley Kent was an inside job and that the theft of the cesium was nothing more than a well-played misdirection.  ''You see the rest now?'' Bosch asked. ''You see how he would work it? Her husband's dead and he starts coming around out of sympathy and because he's on the case. They start dating, fall in love and nobody ever raises an eyebrow about it. They're still out there looking for Moby and Elfayed.''  ''And what if we ever catch those guys?'' Walling said, taking up the story. ''They could deny being a part of this thing until Osama bin Laden dies in a cave of old age, but who would believe them or care? There's nothing more ingenious than framing terrorists with a crime they didn't commit.''  ''A perfect crime. The only reason it blew up was because Digiberto Gonzalves checked that Dumpster. Without him we'd still be chasing Moby and Elfayed.''  ''So what do we do now, Bosch?''  Bosch shrugged but then answered anyway.  ''I say we set up a classic rat pit. Put them both in rooms, ring the bell and say the first one who talks gets the deal. I'd bet on Alice. She'll break and give him up, probably blame him for everything.''  ''Something tells me you're right. And the truth is, I don't think Maxwell was smart enough to pull this off. I worked with --''  Walling's cellphone started buzzing. She took it out of her pocket and looked at the screen.  ''It's Jack.''  ''Find out where Maxwell is.''  She answered the call and first answered a few questions about Bosch's status, telling Brenner that he was O.K. but was losing his voice because his throat hurt. Bosch got up for another bottle of water but listened from the kitchen. Walling casually steered the call toward Maxwell.  ''Hey, where's Cliff, by the way? I wanted to talk to him about that thing with Bosch in the hallway. I didn't like what he --''  She stopped and listened to the answer and Bosch saw her eyes immediately become alert. Something was wrong.  ''When was that?'' she asked.  She listened again and stood up.  ''Listen, Jack, I've got to go. I think Bosch is about to be discharged. I'll check in as soon as I'm clear here.''  She closed the phone and looked at Bosch.  ''What?''  ''Jack said there were too many agents at the recovery scene -- just about everybody came out from downtown and they were standing around waiting on the radiation team. So Maxwell volunteered to go pick up the witness at the Mark Twain. Nobody had gotten around to it because I'd pulled off the original pickup team.''  ''He went alone?''  ''That's what Jack said.''  ''How long ago?''  ''A half-hour.''  ''He's going to kill him.''  Bosch stood up and moved toward the door.  He drove this time. On the way to Hollywood he told Walling that Jesse Mitford had no phone in his room. The Mark Twain wasn't much when it came to full service. Instead, Bosch called the watch commander at Hollywood Division and asked him to send a patrol car to the hotel to check on the witness. He then called Information and was connected to the front desk at the Mark Twain.  ''Alvin, this is Detective Bosch. From this morning?''  ''Yeah, yeah. What's up with you, Detective?''  ''Has anyone come in asking for Charles Dickens?''  ''Mmm, nope.''  ''In the last 20 minutes have you buzzed in anybody who looked like a cop or who wasn't a tenant there?''  ''No, Detective. What's going on?''  ''Listen, I need you to go up to that room and tell Charles Dickens to get out of there and to then call me on my cell.''  ''I got nobody to watch the desk, Detective.''  ''It's an emergency, Alvin. I need to get him out of there. It will take you less than five minutes. Here, write this down. My number is 323-244-5631. You got it?''  ''I got it.''  ''O.K., go. And if anybody but me comes in there looking for him, say he checked out, took a refund and left. Go, Alvin, and thanks.''  Bosch closed the phone and looked over at Rachel. His face showed his lack of confidence in the deskman.  ''I think the guy's a meth-head.''  Bosch increased his speed and tried to concentrate on driving. They had just turned south on Cahuenga off Barham. Depending on traffic in Hollywood, he was thinking that they could get to the Mark Twain in another five minutes. This conclusion made him shake his head. With a half-hour lead, Maxwell should have reached the Mark Twain by now. He wondered if he had slipped in the back way and already gotten to Mitford.  ''Maxwell may have gone in through the back,'' he told Walling. ''I'm going to come in from the alley.''  ''You know,'' Walling said, ''maybe he's not going to hurt him. He'll pick him up and talk to him, judge for himself if he saw enough at the overlook that he'd be a threat.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''No way. Maxwell's got to know that once the cesium was found in the Dumpster that his plan was going down the toilet. He's got to take action against all threats. First the witness, then Alice Kent.''  ''Alice Kent? You think he'd make a move against her? This whole thing is because of her.''  ''Doesn't matter. Survival instincts take over now, and she's a threat. It goes with the territory. You cross the big line to be with her. You cross it again to save your --''  Bosch stopped as a sudden realization thudded in his chest. He cursed out loud and pinned the accelerator as they came out of the Cahuenga Pass. He cut across three lanes of Highland Avenue in front of the Hollywood Bowl and made a screeching U-turn in front of oncoming traffic. He punched it, and the car fishtailed wildly as he headed toward the southbound entrance to the Hollywood Freeway. Rachel grabbed the dashboard and a door handle to hold on.  ''Harry, what are you doing? This is the wrong way!''  He flicked on the siren and the blue lights that flashed in the front grill and back window of the car. He yelled his response to Walling.  ''Mitford is a misdirection. This is the right way. Who is the greater threat to Maxwell?''  ''Alice?''  ''You bet, and now's the best shot he has of getting her out of Tactical. Everybody's up in that alley with the cesium.''  The freeway was moving pretty well, and the siren helped open it up further. Depending on what kind of traffic Maxwell encountered, Bosch figured he could have already gotten to downtown.  Walling opened her phone and started calling numbers. She tried number after number, but no one was answering.  ''I can't get anybody,'' she said.  ''Where's T.I.U.?''  She didn't hesitate.  ''On Broadway. You know where the Million Dollar Theater is? Same building. Entrance on Third.''  Bosch opened his phone once more and called his partner. Ferras answered right away.  ''Ignacio, drop what you're doing and meet me at the Third Street entrance to the Million Dollar Theater building. You know where that is?''  ''What's going on? I hear the siren.''  ''Do you know where the Million Dollar Theater is?''  ''Yeah, I know where it is.''  ''Meet me there at the Third Street entrance. I'll explain when I get there.''  He closed the phone.  The next 10 minutes took 10 hours. Bosch moved in and out of traffic and finally reached the Broadway exit in downtown. He killed the siren as he made the turn and headed down the hill toward their destination. They were three blocks away.  The Million Dollar Theater was built in a time when the movie business showed itself off in magnificent theater palaces that lined Broadway in downtown. But it had been decades since a first-run film was projected on a screen there. Its ornate facade had been covered by a lighted marquee that for a time announced religious revivals instead of movies. Now it waited, unused, for renovation and redemption, while above it a once-grand office building was 12 stories of midgrade office space and residential lofts.  ''Good place for a secret unit to have a secret office,'' Bosch said as the building came into sight. ''Nobody would've guessed.''  Walling didn't respond. She was trying to make another call. She then slapped the phone closed in frustration.  ''I can't even get our secretary. She always takes early lunch so there will be somebody in the office when the agents take lunch.''  ''Where exactly is the squad and where would Alice Kent be in there?''  ''We have the whole seventh floor. There's a lounge with a couch and a TV. They probably put her in there.''  ''How many in the squad?''  ''Eight agents, an A-SAC, the secretary and an office manager. The office manager just went out on maternity leave, and the secretary must be at lunch. I hope. But they wouldn't have left Alice Kent alone. It's against policy. Somebody had to have stayed there with her.''  Bosch turned right on Third and immediately pulled to the curb. Ferras was already there, leaning casually against his Volvo station wagon. In front of it was another parked car. A federal cruiser. Bosch and Walling got out. Bosch approached Ferras, and Walling went to look into the fed car.  ''Have you seen Maxwell?'' Bosch asked.  ''Who?''  ''Agent Maxwell. The guy we put on the floor at the Kent house this morning.''  ''No, I haven't seen anybody. What --''  ''It's his car,'' Walling said as she joined them.  ''Ignacio, this is Agent Walling.''  ''Call me Iggy.''  ''Rachel.''  They shook hands.  ''O.K., then he's gotta be up there,'' Bosch said. ''How many stairwells?''  ''Three,'' Walling said. ''But he'll use the one that comes out by his car.''  She pointed to double steel doors with an exit sign above them. Bosch headed over that way to see if they were locked. Ferras and Walling followed.  ''What is going on?'' Ferras asked.  ''Maxwell is our shooter,'' Bosch said. ''He is up --''  ''What?''  Bosch checked the exit doors. There was no outside handle or knob. He turned to Ferras.  ''Look, there's not a lot of time. Trust me, Maxwell is our guy, and he's in this building to take out Alice Kent. We're --''  ''What is she doing here?''  ''The F.B.I. has a location here. She's here. No more questions, O.K.? Just listen. Agent Walling and I are going up the elevator. I want you out here by this door. If Maxwell comes out, you take him down. You understand?''  ''Got it.''  ''Good. Call for backup. We're going up.''  Bosch reached over and tapped Ferras on the cheek.  ''And stay frosty.''  They left Ferras there and headed through the entrance door. There was no lobby to speak of, just an elevator. It opened at the push of the button, and Walling used a key card to engage the ''7'' button. They started going up.  ''Something tells me you're never going to call him Iggy,'' Walling said.  Bosch ignored the comment but thought of something to ask.  ''Does this thing have a bell or a tone that sounds when it reaches the floor?''  ''I can't remem -- I think it does ... yes, definitely.''  ''Great. We'll be sitting ducks.''  Bosch pulled his gun out of its holster and Walling did the same. Bosch pushed Walling to one side of the elevator while he took the other. He raised his gun. The elevator finally reached seven and there was a soft bell tone from outside. The door began to slide open, exposing Bosch first.  No one was there.  Walling signaled that the offices were to the left after exiting the elevator. Bosch lowered himself into a combat crouch and stepped out, his gun up and ready.  Again, no one was there.  He started moving to his left. Rachel came out and moved with him on his right flank. They came to a loft-style office with two rows of cubicles -- the squad room -- and three private rooms that had been built free-standing in the open floor plan. There were large racks of electronic equipment between the cubicles, and every desk had two computer screens on it. It looked as if the whole place could be packed up and moved on a moment's notice.  Bosch stepped farther in, and through a window in one of the private offices he saw a man sitting in a chair, his head back and eyes open. It looked as if he were wearing a red bib. But Bosch knew it was blood. The man had been shot in the chest.  He pointed, and Walling saw the dead man. She reacted with a quick intake of breath and a low-volume sigh.  The door to the office was ajar. They moved toward it and Bosch pushed it open while Walling covered them from behind. Bosch stepped in and saw Alice Kent sitting on the floor, her back to the wall.  He crouched beside her. Her eyes were open but dead. A gun was on the floor between her feet, and the wall behind her was spattered with blood and brain matter.  Bosch turned and surveyed the room. He understood the play. It was set up so it would look as if Alice Kent had grabbed the agent's gun from his holster, shot him and then sat down on the floor and taken her own life. No note or explanation, but it was the best Maxwell could come up with in the short amount of time and opportunity he had.  Bosch turned to Walling. She had let her guard down and was just standing there looking at the dead agent.  ''Rachel --''  There were sudden shots from outside the room and the window shattered, spraying glass across the room. Maxwell had sprung from behind one of the electronics racks. Bosch rolled to his right and came up firing, putting six shots in a spread through the window into the squad room. He caught a glimpse of Maxwell at the last moment as he jumped from cover and hit a door with an exit sign hanging from the ceiling over it.  ''Rachel?''  ''I'm fine. Go!''  ''Which exit is that door?''  He pointed at the black door Maxwell had gone through. Walling stood up and looked. Bosch saw glass all over her clothes and that she had been cut on the cheek.  ''Those stairs go down to his car.''  Bosch ran from the room toward the exit door. He opened his phone as he went and pushed the speed dial for his partner. The call was answered on half a ring. Bosch had already hit the door and was in the stairwell.  ''He's coming down!''  Bosch dropped the phone and started down the stairs. He could hear Maxwell running on the steel steps below and instinctively knew that he was too far ahead.  Bosch covered three more landings, taking three steps at a time. He could hear Walling coming down behind him. He then heard the booming sound from below as Maxwell hit the exit door at the bottom. There were immediate shouts, and then there were shots. They came so close together that it was impossible to determine how many had been fired.  Ten seconds later Bosch hit the exit door. He ran out onto the sidewalk and saw Ferras leaning against the back bumper of Maxwell's fed car. He was holding his weapon with one hand and his elbow with the other. A red rose of blood was blooming on his shoulder. Traffic had stopped in both directions on Third, and pedestrians were running down the sidewalks to safety.  ''I hit him twice,'' Ferras yelled. ''He went that way.''  He nodded in the direction of the Third Street tunnel under Bunker Hill. Bosch stepped closer to his partner and saw the wound in the ball of his shoulder. It didn't look too bad.  ''Did you call for backup?'' Bosch asked.  ''On the way.''  Ferras grimaced as he adjusted his hold on his injured arm.  ''You did real good, Iggy. Hang in there while I go get this guy.''  Ferras nodded. Bosch turned and saw Walling come through the door, a smear of blood on her face.  ''This way,'' he said.  They started down Third in a spread formation. After a few steps Bosch picked up the trail. Maxwell was obviously hurt bad and was losing a lot of blood. It would make him easy to track.  But in another 20 feet it didn't matter. Maxwell stopped them with his voice. He called out from an alleyway running perpendicular to Third.  ''I just want to say ... that it was her. She wanted him dead. I just ... I just wanted her. That's all. But she wouldn't have it any other way ... and I did what she wanted. For that ... I am damned. ...''  Bosch quietly approached the corner on a wide turn. He had his gun up and ready. Then Maxwell spoke again.  ''I'm sorry,'' he said.  Then there was another shot. Bosch made the turn and saw Maxwell on the ground leaning against the wall, his gun on the pavement between his outstretched legs. In his suicide he adopted the same position as his lover, the woman he had just killed.  Walling stood next to Bosch and looked down at the dead agent. She said nothing. Bosch checked his watch. It was almost noon. He had ridden the case from beginning to end in 12 hours. The tally was four dead, one wounded and one dying of radiation exposure.  And then there was Bosch. He wondered if he was going to be part of the tally by the time all was said and done. His throat was now blazing, and there was a heaviness in his chest.  He looked over at Walling and saw blood running down her cheek again. She would need stitches to close the wound.  ''You know what?'' he said. ''I'll take you to the hospital if you take me.''  She looked at him and smiled sort of sadly.  ''Throw in Iggy and you've got yourself a deal.''  Bosch left her there with Maxwell and walked out of the alley and back toward his partner. Backup units had just turned off Broadway onto Third. There were sirens blaring and crowds forming. Bosch decided he would leave it to the patrol officers to take charge of the crime scene. He leaned against the fender next to Ferras and told him that Maxwell had just killed himself.  ''Hell of a way to go, I guess,'' Ferras said.  Bosch nodded but kept silent. His thoughts moved down the streets and up the hills to the overlook, where the last thing Stanley Kent ever saw was the city spread before him in beautiful shimmering light. Bosch thought that maybe it wasn't so bad, for a last view. Maybe to Stanley it even looked like heaven.  Next week: The debut of ''Gentlemen of the Road,'' by Michael Chabon.

            "fulltext": "IT was 3:55 a.m., and Floyd Cray, hopped up on Red Bull and feeling the love and the hip-hop spirit, rose to the mike and addressed the faithful.  ''We're not here to kill you,'' he began in a tone at once robust and reassuring, surveying the tiny studio for encouragement. ''And we're not here to mug you,'' he added, in a sarcastic swipe at hip-hop stereotypes.  ''We're here gettin' high on the Lord,'' he thundered, cueing a track with a boom-boom beat whose first verse rhymed the words ''gospel'' and ''hostile.''  So go the weekly proceedings on ''Gospel Vibrations,'' a religious rap program presented from 1:15 to 6 a.m. Saturdays on the noncommercial radio station WFDU-FM (89.1) here. When Mr. Cray, the show's host, is not bantering in the studio with guests like the two tricked-out Christian-rap artists from Brooklyn who stopped by to promote new albums during a recent show, he's taking calls from the devout, the lonesome, the sleepless and the bored.  And though he is certainly in a class by himself -- ''We're the No. 1 gospel hip-hop show in the New York metro area,'' Mr. Cray, 51, likes to crow, though he is hard-pressed to come up with competitors -- he is not alone as an overnight radio host.  Flip a radio dial in the New York suburbs, AM or FM, and a smooth-talking D.J. is as likely to rumble through your speakers at 3 a.m. as at noon. But with few exceptions, the late-night host who aims to soothe listeners with light-music favorites or stimulate them with titillating talk is -- quite unlike Mr. Cray -- a mirage.  ''There's so much automation in overnight radio now, it's getting to be rare that you'll find a live show, even in a market as big as New York,'' said Robert Unmacht, a radio analyst based in Nashville. ''And it's not always easy to tell, because they voice-track,'' using pre-recorded D.J.'s to create the illusion of a live presence in the studio.  ''It's a shame how little credence they give that time slot, because it's traditionally been a training ground for great D.J.'s, the radio legends,'' Mr. Unmacht said.  ''Historically, it's the time of night when radio magic happens. It's a combination of entertainment, information and companionship, and when it's done right it can be brilliant. But with automation, which we started seeing in the late '80s, they're taking the companionship out of the mix. In such a large market as New York, it's the equivalent of Wal-Mart leaving its back shelves empty because they're too far back. It makes sense to use every bit of real estate you've got.''  Mr. Cray may be in radio Siberia, but at least he's on the air.  Of the roughly 275 public and private, commercial and noncommercial licensed stations in Connecticut, New Jersey, Westchester and Long Island, perhaps fewer than 20 staff the overnight shift with live hosts. Of those, fewer than five are high-wattage commercial stations with broad interstate reaches.  The independent end of the dial, where most late-night suburban D.J.'s lurk, is ragtag but colorful. In addition to Mr. Cray, hosts like Nick Fox, 19, who plays hardcore reggae and ska at WUSB-FM (90.1) in Stony Brook, N.Y., on alternate Thursdays from midnight to 3 a.m., and Leanne Kohlbecker, 20, who spins cutting-edge metal at WSOU-FM (89.5) in South Orange, N.J., on Mondays from 2 to 6 a.m., satisfy appetites for fringe music and attract deeply devoted listeners. At WFMU-FM (91.1) in Jersey City, Stan Stolpiec's experimental music show on Tuesdays from 2 to 6 a.m. has been the forum for a handful of weekly callers, mainly artists and insomniacs, for 22 years.  What accounts for the willingness of smaller stations, many of them college-based, to keep live hosts on the air is their freedom from dependence on the listener numbers that dictate playlists and personalities at commercial stations swallowed by conglomerates like Clear Channel and Cox Communications. (Mr. Cray's station, WFDU, is among the few small stations that subscribe to ratings services; others can only guess at the size of their audiences.) It also helps that jocks at smaller stations often work free and tend to stick around for years.  ''I've had people name their children after me,'' said Henry Brown, coordinator of nighttime radio for WRTC-FM (89.3) in Hartford and host of the ''Mr. Magic Man'' R & B show, which goes on the air when one of the 18 volunteer D.J.'s cannot make it to the studio. It is only the latest of many overnight programs he has run in 30 years at the station, which is owned by Trinity College.  The little stations, several D.J.'s said, are where friends are made, and where the sleep-deprived turn for trusted companionship.  But if the descendants of long-gone radio personalities like Murray the K and Alison Steele are holed up in tiny stations with tinier budgets easing like-minded subculturalists through the night, their brethren at medium-to-big stations are directing their own kind of late-night theater under a different set of house rules. In the small hours of Tuesday morning at the Cox-owned rock station WPLR-FM (99.1) in Milford, Conn., Jesse Gosselin, hired by WPLR seven years ago after he was host of a ska show on the small Danbury-based station WXCI-FM (91.7), could not help seeming tied to a formula.  As he checked listener e-mail messages from third-shifters and insomniacs during a Led Zeppelin track about 3 a.m., he glanced back and forth between his computer and a wall clock surrounded by banners heralding ''50 Minutes of Rock,'' the quota the station promises per hour.  ''I can't miss my 16 break,'' he said, referring to the appointed time -- 3:16 a.m. -- when he needed to alert his estimated 11,000 listeners across Connecticut, Long Island, eastern New York, the lower half of Massachusetts and most of Rhode Island that the temperature on the New Haven Green was 31 degrees, and that they were listening to WPLR. Cox mandates four such breaks per hour.  At 3:17, back at his e-mail and with Judas Priest in place on the radio, Mr. Gosselin, 29, shared a request from a regular listener, Dave.  ''Oh, he knows better than that,'' Mr. Gosselin said between sips of a Diet Pepsi, one of six he generally drains weekdays between midnight and 5:30 a.m. ''He wants me to play 'Rock Lobster' by the B-52s, but he knows I can't. I'm required to play exactly what's on this list, in the exact order,'' he said, plunking down a sheaf of computer printouts with song titles like ''Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin' '' by Journey and ''Baba O'Riley'' by the Who.  Mr. Gosselin says WPLR's music is limited to 300 songs selected through focus groups. But whatever creativity he loses in his playlist, he tries to make up for in the few moments when his audience hears his voice. In anywhere from 30 to 100 calls a night, ''I usually hear from Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford or Stop & Shop or Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford. These are guys stocking shelves,'' Mr. Gosselin said.  ''So I have a thing where I say, 'Tell me your favorite slacker story,' because a lot of times, they'll get their work done really fast so they can spend the rest of their shift hanging out, listening to the radio. They'll call me and tell me how the boss is ragging them. We can't air the calls, so I'll do an on-air dedication or give them a quick mention.''  Or not.  ''Sometimes I'll get a call from a regular listener who's working and really wants to hear a certain song, some 20-minute Allman Brothers live jam, and he'll say, 'Why don't you be the rebellious rock 'n' roll guy and play what you want?' '' Mr. Gosselin said. ''Then sometimes somebody who doesn't know how the station operates will write and say: 'You pick the best songs. I love the music you play.' ''  In addition to a paycheck and health insurance, the incentives for overnight D.J.'s at bigger stations include the larger audience afforded by a stronger signal. That gives them a broader understanding of the average local nightcrawler.  ''You get your loonies, you get your drunks,'' said John Nolan, 52, a self-described ''dinosaur in the world of overnight radio'' with 25 years' experience on the weeknight late-late shift at WHUD-FM (100.7) in Peekskill, a Clay Aiken- and Celine Dion-leaning station owned by Pamal Broadcasting that reaches across the Hudson Valley and pulls in 20,000 listeners a night. ''It's a 24-hour world out there.''  THAT world is populated by the chummy, according to Bill Beale of WSPK-FM (104.7), a pop station in Poughkeepsie also owned by Pamal Broadcasting and heard across Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Dutchess and Westchester Counties and into the Catskills. Callers, a small but important contingent of Mr. Beale's overnight audience, which the station estimates at 30,000, keep him convinced that live jocks are still valued.  ''On the overnights you get more frequent, regular callers because they know you're there,'' he said. ''You're not some machine somebody pushed 'play' on.''  From midnight to 5:30 a.m. weekdays, Mr. Beale, 30, takes 25 calls or more from people who just want to talk, sometimes about a song, sometimes about what his life is like, he said.  ''They want to know what I'm doing, how it's going,'' he said. ''It's chitchat, but it can be important to people at that time of night.''  If there is an overlap among late-night listeners of quirky independent programs and those of corporate-defined shows like Mr. Gosselin's, it is perhaps best identified by profession.  ''I get people in prison, I get police, I get nurses and doctors,'' said Mr. Brown at WRTC. In addition to those standbys, Mr. Nolan said, he takes calls from Dunkin' Donuts employees trying to keep awake. Ms. Kohlbecker, of WSOU in South Orange, said she often hears from auto mechanics and gym rats, sometimes flirtatious ones. And Mr. Gosselin made a point of mentioning the herd of interstate truck drivers who regularly call to make requests or to thank him for playing their favorites.  But even with as many shout-outs, slacker stories, hip-hop testimonials and long-distance dedications as there are to go around, overnight radio can feel like a wasteland when the lines go quiet and the host's caffeine buzz wears thin.  ''There are some nights where you sit there and you say to yourself, 'Is anybody out there?' '' said Richard Hughes, 49, a proofreader by day whose ''Local Insomniac'' program, which presents only music by Long Island performers, runs midnight to 3 a.m. Wednesdays at WUSB, the Island's largest noncommercial station.  Many D.J.'s would trade their nighttime shifts in a blink. ''If I get close to 7,000 listeners now, imagine what I could do in a different time slot,'' Mr. Cray said, sounding hopeful.  But for others, like those who said they fell asleep with a transistor radio tucked beneath their pillows as children, accompanying suburban night owls through the wee hours is an honor to be savored while it lasts.  ''It's very intimate, very personal, the late nights,'' said Ron Hoffman, 41, whose '70s-themed show at WHPC-FM (90.3) in Garden City, N.Y., runs Tuesdays from midnight to 2 a.m.  ''So many stations are automated now, it's like a club,'' he said. ''At that time of night, we can all relate.'' Mr. Stolpiec, 51, the 22-year WFMU stalwart, put it in slightly different terms.  ''I like people, but I'm also a loner. That's why the overnight is good for me,'' he said.  ''I don't sit there and put my feet up. I think about the songs, what I'm going to play next, and I talk to like-minded people.  ''It's such a mentally expansive time of night.''",

            "fulltext": "Bosch's search of the radiation victim's clothes has yielded no cesium. It turns out that he's Mexican, and Agent Walling tries to connect him to the Middle Eastern terrorists, who were believed to have entered the United States through the Mexican border. But Bosch isn't convinced.  Harry Bosch knew that the physics of traffic would not work for him in the Cahuenga Pass. The Hollywood Freeway always moved slowly in both directions through the bottleneck created by the cut in the mountain chain. He decided to stay on surface streets and take Highland Avenue past the Hollywood Bowl and up into the pass. He filled Rachel Walling in along the way.  ''The call for paramedics came from a print shop on Cahuenga near Lankershim. Gonzalves must have been in the area when he collapsed. The initial call said a man was down in the parking lot. I'm hoping that the Toyota he was driving is right there. I'm betting that if we find it, we find the cesium. The mystery is why he had it.''  ''And why he was foolish enough to put it unprotected in his pocket,'' Walling added.  ''You're basing that on him knowing what he had. Maybe he didn't. Maybe this isn't what we think it is.''  ''There's got to be a connection, Bosch, between Gonzalves and Nassar and Elfayed. He probably brought them across the border.''  ''We'll see.''  He almost smiled. He knew she had used his last name as a term of endearment. He remembered how she used to do that.  He took the ramp up to Cahuenga from Highland. It ran parallel to the freeway, and as soon as he checked, he saw that he had been right. The freeway was frozen in both directions.  ''You know, I still had your number in my cell's directory,'' he said. ''I guess I never wanted to delete it.''  ''I was wondering about that when you left me that mean message today about the cigarette ash.''  ''I don't suppose you kept mine, Rachel.''  She paused a long moment before answering.  ''I think you're still on my phone, too, Harry.''  This time he had to smile, even though he was back to being Harry with her. There's hope after all, he thought.  They were approaching Lankershim Boulevard. To the right it dropped down into a tunnel beneath the freeway. To the left it ended at a strip mall that included the Easy Print franchise from which the call to paramedics had originated. Bosch's eyes searched the vehicles in the small parking lot, looking for a Toyota.  He glided into the left-turn lane and waited to pull into the lot. He swiveled in his seat and checked the parking along both sides of Cahuenga. The quick glance showed no Toyotas, but he knew the brand had many different car models and pickup trucks. If they didn't find the car in the print-shop lot, they would have to work the curbside parking to look for it.  ''Do you have a plate or any description?'' Walling asked. ''How about a color?''  ''No, no and no.''  Bosch remembered then that she had the habit of asking multiple questions at once.  He made the turn on yellow and pulled into the lot. There were no parking spaces available, but he wasn't interested in parking. He cruised slowly, checking each car. There were no Toyotas.  ''Where's a Toyota when you need one?'' he said. ''It's got to be in this area somewhere.''  ''Maybe we should check the street,'' Walling suggested.  He nodded and nosed his car into the alley at the end of the parking lot. He was going to turn left to turn around and go back to the street. But when he checked to see if he was clear on the right, he saw an old white pickup truck with a camper shell parked half a block down the alley next to a green Dumpster. The truck was facing them, and he couldn't tell what make it was.  ''Is that a Toyota?'' he asked.  Walling turned and looked.  ''Bosch, you're a genius,'' she exclaimed.  Bosch turned and drove toward the truck, and as he got closer, he could see that it was indeed a Toyota. So could Walling. She pulled out her phone, but Bosch reached across and put his hand on it.  ''Let's just check it out first. I could be wrong about this.''  ''No, Bosch, you're on a roll.''  But she put the phone away. Bosch pulled slowly past the pickup, giving it a once-over. He then turned around at the end of the block and came back. He stopped his car 10 feet behind it. There was no plate on the back. A cardboard ''Lost Tag'' sign had been put in its place.  Bosch wished he had brought the keys he found in Digiberto Gonzalves's pocket. They got out and approached the truck, coming up on either side of it. When he got close, Bosch noticed that the rear-window hatch of the camper shell had been left open a couple of inches. He reached forward and pulled it up and open all the way. An air-pressure hinge held it open. Bosch leaned in close to look into the interior. It was dark because the truck was parked in shadow and the windows on the shell were darkly tinted.  ''Harry, you have that monitor?''  He pulled her radiation monitor off his belt and held it up in his hand as he leaned into the darkness of the truck's cargo hold. No alarm sounded. He leaned back out and put the monitor back on his belt. He then reached in to the latch and lowered the truck's rear gate.  The back of the truck was piled with junk. There were empty bottles and cans strewn everywhere, a leather desk chair with a broken leg, scrap pieces of aluminum, an old water cooler and other debris. And there by the raised wheel well on the right side was a gray lead container that looked like a small mop bucket on wheels.  ''Is that the pig?'' he asked.  ''I think it is,'' Walling said excitedly. ''I think it is!''  There was no warning sticker on it or radiation-alert symbol. They had been peeled off. Bosch leaned into the truck and grabbed one of the handles. He pulled it clear of the debris around it and rolled it to the tailgate. The top was latched in four places.  ''Do we open it and make sure the stuff is in there?'' he asked.  ''No,'' Walling said. ''We back off and call in the team. They have protection.''  She pulled her phone out again. While she called for the radiation team and backup units Bosch moved to the front of the truck. He looked through the window and into the cab. He saw more junk on the passenger side. His eyes held on a camera that was sitting on an old briefcase with a broken handle on the passenger seat. It didn't appear to be broken or dirty. It looked brand-new.  Bosch checked the door and found it unlocked. He realized that Gonzalves had forgotten about his truck and his possessions when the cesium started burning his body. He had gotten out and stumbled toward the parking lot seeking help, leaving everything behind and unlocked.  Bosch opened the driver's door and reached in with the radiation monitor. Nothing happened. No alert. He replaced it on his belt and walked back to his car. From the equipment kit in the trunk he got out a pair of latex gloves and put them on.  When he walked back past Walling, she was talking to someone about finding the pig. He moved back to the truck's cab. He leaned in and picked up the camera. It was a Nikon digital, and he remembered the lens cap found beneath the master bed at the Kent house by the SID team. He believed he was holding the camera that had taken the photograph of Alice Kent.  Bosch put the camera down and began looking through the things piled on the passenger seat. There was the broken briefcase, a child's lunch box, a manual for operating an Apple computer and a poker from a fireplace tool set. Nothing connected, and nothing interested him. He noticed a golf putter and a rolled-up poster on the floor.  He shifted his weight to one elbow on the armrest between the seats so that he could reach over and open the glove compartment. And there, sitting in the otherwise empty space, was a gun. Bosch lifted it out and turned it in his hand. It was a Smith & Wesson .22-caliber revolver.  ''I think we've got the murder weapon here,'' he called out.  There was no response from Walling. She was still at the back of the truck talking on her phone, now issuing orders in a hurried voice.  Bosch returned the weapon to the glove box and closed it, deciding to leave the weapon in its place for the forensics team. He noticed the poster again and decided for no reason other than curiosity to take a look at it. He unrolled it across all of the junk on the passenger seat. It was a chart depicting 12 yoga positions.  Bosch immediately thought about the discolored space he had seen on the wall in the workout room at the Kent house. He wasn't sure, but he thought the dimensions of the poster would match that space. He quickly rerolled the poster and started to back out of the cab so he could show Walling his discovery.  But as he was pulling out, he noticed that the armrest was also a storage compartment. He stopped and opened it.  He froze. There was a cup holder and in it were several steel capsules resembling bullet cartridges closed flat on both ends. The steel was so polished it almost looked like silver.  Bosch moved the radiation monitor over the capsules in a circular pattern. There was no alarm. He turned the device over in his hand and looked at it. He saw a small switch on its side. With his thumb he pushed it up. A blaring alarm suddenly went off, the frequency of tones so fast that it sounded like one long, ear-piercing siren.  Bosch jumped back out of the truck and slammed the door shut. The poster fell to the ground.  ''Harry!'' Walling yelled. ''What?''  She rushed toward him, closing her phone on her hip. Bosch pushed the switch again and turned the monitor off.  ''What is it?'' she yelled.  Bosch pointed toward the truck's door.  ''The gun's in the glove box and the cesium's in the center compartment.''  ''What?''  ''The cesium is in the compartment under the armrest. He took the capsules out of the pig. That's why they weren't in his pocket. They were in the center armrest.''  He touched his right hip, the place where Gonzalves was burned by radiation. The same spot would have been next to the armrest compartment if he was sitting in the truck.  Rachel didn't say anything for a long moment. She just stared at his face.  ''Are you O.K.?'' she finally asked.  Bosch almost laughed.  ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Ask me in about 10 years.''  She hesitated as if she knew something but couldn't share it.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing. You should be checked out, though.''  ''What are they going to be able to do? Look, I wasn't in the truck that long. It's not like Gonzalves, who was sitting in there with it.''  She didn't answer. Bosch handed her the monitor.  ''It was never on. I thought it was on when you gave it to me.''  She took it and looked at it in her hand.  ''I thought it was, too.''  Bosch looked back at the truck and wondered if he had just hurt or killed himself.  ''I need a drink of water,'' he said. ''I've got a bottle in the trunk.''  Bosch walked to the back of his car. Using the open trunk lid to shield Walling's view of him, he leaned his hands down onto the bumper for support and tried to decipher the messages his body was sending to his brain. He felt something happening but didn't know if it was something physically occurring to him or just the emotional response -- the shakes -- to what had just happened. He suddenly thought of his daughter, getting a vision of her at the airport the last time he saw her.  He cursed out loud.  ''Harry?''  Bosch looked around the trunk lid. Rachel was walking toward him.  ''The teams are headed this way. They'll be here in five minutes. How do you feel?''  ''I think I'm O.K.''  He reached into the trunk and got a liter bottle of water out of his kit. It was an emergency bottle he kept for surveillances that dragged on longer than expected. He opened it and took two strong pulls. The water wasn't cold, but it felt good going down. His throat was dry.  Bosch recapped the bottle and put it back in the kit. He stepped around the car to Walling. As he walked toward her he looked past her to the south. He realized that the alley they were in extended several blocks past the back of the Easy Print and ran behind all the storefronts and offices on Cahuenga. All the way down to Barham.  Every 20 yards or so there was a green Dumpster positioned perpendicular to the rear of the structures. Bosch realized that the Dumpsters had been pushed out of spaces between the buildings and fenced corrals. It was pickup day, and the Dumpsters were waiting for the city trucks to come.  Suddenly it all came to him. Like fusion. Like two elements coming together and creating a new element. It all came together for Bosch in that moment. The thing that bothered him about the photos, the yoga poster, everything. The gamma rays had shot right through him, but they had left him enlightened. He knew. He understood.  ''He's a scavenger.''  ''Who is?''  ''Digiberto Gonzalves,'' Bosch said, his eyes looking down the alley. ''It's collection day. The Dumpsters are all pushed out for the city trucks. Gonzalves is a scavenger, a Dumpster diver, and he knew they would be out and this would be a good time to come here. ...  ''And so did somebody else.''  ''You mean he found the cesium in a Dumpster?''  Bosch nodded and pointed down the alley.  ''All the way at the end, that's Barham. Barham takes you up to Lake Hollywood. Lake Hollywood takes you to the overlook. This case never leaves the page.''  Walling came over and stood in front of him, blocking his view. Bosch could hear sirens in the distance.  ''What are you saying? That Nassar and Elfayed took the cesium and stashed it in a Dumpster at the bottom of the hill? Then this scavenger comes along and finds it?''  ''I'm saying you've got the cesium back, so now we're looking at this as a homicide again. You come down from the overlook, and you can be in this alley in five minutes.''  ''So what? They stole the cesium and killed Kent just so they could come down here and stash it? Is that what you're saying? Or are you saying they just threw it all away? Why would they do that? I mean, does that make any sense at all?''  Bosch noted that she had asked six questions at once this time, possibly a new record.  ''Nassar and Elfayed were never near the cesium,'' he said. ''That's what I'm saying.''  He walked over to the truck and picked the poster up off the ground. He handed it to Rachel. The sirens were getting louder.  She unrolled the poster in her hands and looked at it.  ''What is this? What does it mean?''  Bosch took it back from her and started rolling it back up.  ''Gonzalves found that in the same Dumpster he found the gun and the camera and the lead pig.''  ''So? What does it mean, Harry?''  Two fed cars pulled into the alley a block away and started making their way toward them, weaving around the Dumpsters pushed out for pickup. As they got close, Bosch could see that the driver of the lead car was Jack Brenner.  ''Do you hear me, Harry? What does it --''  Bosch's knees suddenly seemed to give out and he fell into her, throwing his arms around her to stop himself from hitting the ground.  ''Bosch!''  She grabbed on and held him.  ''Uh ... I'm not feeling so good,'' he mumbled. ''I think I better. ... Can you take me to my car?''  She helped him straighten up and then started walking him toward his car. He put his arm over her shoulders. Car doors were slamming behind them as the agents got out.  ''Where are the keys?'' Walling asked.  He held the key ring up to her just as Brenner ran up to them.  ''What is it? What's wrong?''  ''He was exposed. The cesium is in the center console in the truck cab. Be careful. I'm going to take him to the hospital.''  Brenner stepped back, as if whatever Bosch had was contagious.  ''O.K.,'' he said. ''Call me when you can.''  Bosch and Walling kept moving toward the car.  ''Come on, Bosch,'' Walling said. ''Stay with me. Hang in there and we'll get you taken care of.''  Bosch almost smiled. She had called him by his last name.  Next week: Reeling from exposure, Bosch fingers the wrong man.

The effect is as if the part of her face that isn't made up has been erased. She is speaking in a loud voice so that her daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo), can hear her in the bedroom.  RAIMUNDA -- Paula! Get ready, people will start arriving in half an hour.  In her room, Paula, serious and indolent, is lying on her bed, still wearing a track suit. She is reading a book by Paul Auster and doesn't deign to answer her mother. As she doesn't get an answer, Raimunda goes into Paula's room.  RAIMUNDA -- (fondly) Are you still like that?  PAULA -- I'm not in the mood for a party.  RAIMUNDA -- Neither am I, but it's work. Come on, don't be such a lazybones. I'll help you. What's wrong?  Raimunda sits on the bed with her daughter.  PAULA -- (serious) I can't get him out of my head when he's so close, there, in the storeroom.  Raimunda's forced optimism fades.  RAIMUNDA -- That's the best way to drive yourself crazy and to drive me crazy, too!  PAULA -- Mom, you don't know what it's like to have killed your father!  Raimunda looks at her and from her expression seems to be saying: ''There are some fathers who deserve it'' or ''You were just defending yourself.'' However, she says:  RAIMUNDA -- Paco wasn't your father.  PAULA -- Mom, don't lie to me anymore. I know you're doing it for me, but please, don't lie.  Raimunda's recently painted eyes fill up with tears that don't quite overflow. Defeated, wearily:  RAIMUNDA -- I'm not lying. Paco recognized you as his daughter, but he knew he wasn't your biological father.  On the bedside table there is a framed photo of the three. Paula is just a baby. Paco is rocking her lovingly in his arms. Paula looks at the photo.  PAULA -- Then  he was telling the truth.  RAIMUNDA -- (without any viciousness, but firmly) Yes, but that doesn't justify what he did.  Paula, curious and stunned, looks at her mother, overwhelmed by memories.  RAIMUNDA -- (pleading) I promise I'll tell you everything, another time. I swear. And now, let's get ready. There's no point in sitting here.  PAULA -- Who was my father?  RAIMUNDA -- Someone from the village.  PAULA -- Do I know him?  RAIMUNDA -- He's dead. (Pleading) Paula, I swear I'll tell you everything.  Paula looks at her and agrees.  PAULA -- (adult) I'll hold you to your word.  THE OSCARS: EXCERPTS -- VOLVER",

            "fulltext": "WHEN someone is auditioning for a part in a theatrical production, I can usually tell if they're right for the role in a minute or less. How can I know so quickly?''  Casting 40 shows a year helps. But I have another secret: I travel a lot. On the road, you see some of the best acting. And the worst.  Flight attendants are the best actors, hands down. On a trip from New York to Los Angeles not too long ago, a passenger seated across from me decided to get himself drunk, and the attendant was onto him.  ''When you get a chance ?'' he would say whenever she passed by his seat.  ''As soon as I have time,'' she would say.  Finally, after serving him his fifth Bloody Mary, she cut him off. ''I'm really sorry,'' she said. ''We have a limit.'' She wasn't sorry. But she made him think she was. That's great acting.  If you want to see bad acting, just hang out next to the gate on an oversold flight. When there's only one seat left and several passengers vying for it, you get a lot of drama.  There's always the guy in the power suit who growls, ''Do you know who I am?''  There's someone with a sob story who is going to visit a long-lost relative. Usually, the family member is old or dying, or both. It's not very believable.  Sometimes, people are most convincing when they are silent. On a stopover in Charlotte a few months ago, a young woman near me looked like a model on her way to a fashion shoot in Milan. With her long scarf and sunglasses, she turned heads as she walked through the terminal.  Then she flipped out her cellphone. ''Aunt Ada?'' she said, with a heavy Southern drawl. ''I'm at the airport now. Looks like I'll be landing in Spokane on time.''  From Audrey Hepburn to Daisy Duke in less than 10 seconds.  I try to not to offer advice, but sometimes I can't help myself. Earlier this year, while I was in New York for an acting competition, I caught a cab across town. When the driver found out what I was doing, he said, ''You know, I've always wanted to be an actor.''  I spent the rest of the trip listening to Shakespeare monologues. He had a gorgeous voice -- deep, rich and utterly mesmerizing. I told him he had what it took, and encouraged him to pursue his dream.  So who are the worst actors? As a group, I would have to say it is car rental company employees. They're not very charismatic and they hardly ever look you in the eye. All they seem to care about is processing your paperwork, handing you the keys and moving on to the next customer.  Maybe they're in dire need of acting lessons, but as a public service, I've decided not to volunteer. Why try to fool customers into thinking they're interested in their satisfaction? Besides, there are already enough actors out there trying to break into show business.  FREQUENT FLIER E-mail: elliott@nytimes.com",

            "fulltext": "MANY things you live through as a kid are unpleasant, but you survive them, grow up, think you're done with all that, then experience that very emotion again as you watch your children go through the same misery.  Seeing your child picked on -- physically or emotionally -- is a hard one. You ache to spare them what you went through, though I, for one, could not. In one case, my oldest was in third grade and a kid was repeatedly jamming his head against the school bus window. I told Ben I'd talk to the principal, but he begged me not to. I told him he ought to just smack the kid, but he would not; he feared getting in trouble. I told him I thought it was worth the punishment; he did not.  My daughter was a few years older when she was frozen out by a couple of girls. I counseled her to ignore them as aggressively as they were ignoring her -- but she didn't want my advice, and the more I talked to her, the angrier she got. I hated seeing her hang around waiting for those girls to instant-message back.  Maybe if the situations had been more extreme I'd have intervened, but I felt that even at a young age the kids had the right to work these problems through themselves, and I kept my distance.  Still, it hurt to watch. What I could do was remind them how much they were loved; explain that I'd gone through the same thing; and tell them my story of being ostracized, which, as it turns out, was recently resolved -- 40 years later.  When I was in junior high I was part of a group of four boys. We were all good students and very close. We'd spend as much time together as we could in and out of school. I'd often go over to their houses. We formed a club, were forever making grand plans.  Then, during eighth grade, without a harsh word and with no warning, they froze me out. They stopped calling, ignored me at school. If I committed some gaffe -- like wearing white sports socks with dark shoes -- they'd find it hilarious. If I phoned, they weren't home. When I spoke to them at school, they'd shrug, saying nothing.  It was painful and humiliating, too; other kids knew.  I wished for it to stop, but it didn't. After being good buddies of mine since fifth grade, they didn't talk to me again.  In the months that followed, I spent lots of time alone. My mother noticed -- she'd watch me sulk around and ask why I never called my friends anymore. I said nothing. How could she understand? How do you make kids like you who don't want to? No one has that power, certainly not a parent.  While I was sure it wasn't my fault, can you ever be sure?  It changed me. I became more guarded, more of an outsider, more aware that people weren't what they seemed to be. Now, as an adult, I know this was an important part of growing up. I was learning to view the world with a harder eye. In eighth grade, it just felt lonely.  This wasn't some epic tragedy. In time, I made new friends, the pain receded, and after a while I gave it little thought, until years later I told my own kids the story as a balm.  About five years ago, one of the three boys -- now a middle-aged academic -- sent an e-mail message to The New York Times, saying he'd seen my byline and, if I was the same person, he'd like to get in touch to apologize for something bad he'd done when we were kids. The editor who forwarded the note said it sounded so juicy, I had to call him. But I didn't. By then it seemed like small potatoes, and I really didn't feel a need for an apology.  A few years later I learned from a mutual acquaintance that he had died from health problems and wondered: Did he know he was dying? Is that why he'd written? About the same time, a second ''boy'' in the group -- by then a 52-year-old physician -- died in a traffic accident. In my mind they were still in junior high, and now two were dead.  Then, a few weeks ago, I got an e-mail message from the last ''boy.'' He'd tracked me down online. Michael Bernstein wrote that he was an educator in Jewish studies in Australia. He said that he'd read my recent column about my mother's death and wanted to extend his condolences.  ''More important, however, although it is belated, I want to apologize for my appalling behavior as a teenager in deliberately ostracizing you and, for no sensible reason, severing our childhood friendship,'' he wrote. ''Although it is easy to expedite the excuse of youthful folly, I would be lying if I said that I didn't know my behavior was wrong. The tragic truth is I just didn't care. I remember in high school making a lame attempt at rectification by treating you with a bit more kindness, but I never had the courage to say that I was sorry. I hope you can accept that apology now, even if it is 40 years overdue.''  I wrote back telling him how stunned I had been to hear from him, and how pleased, too, and that our falling-out had long ago stopped mattering to me. I filled him in on what I knew about the other two -- he hadn't heard from them in years -- and wrote that I'd told my own children our story and might like to include it in a parenting column.  He responded graciously: ''I am happy for you to use our story instructively in one of your pieces, and I have no objection to you using my name.''  However, he went on to write that there was one piece of unfinished business. ''I noted that you did not really accept my apology,'' he wrote. ''When it comes to apologies, it is the perpetrator's wish to rectify things that needs to be respected rather than the sentiments of the victim. Although you might feel it was a long time and you don't need to be apologized to, obviously I feel otherwise or I would not have contacted you. From a kabbalistic perspective, it is the formal acceptance of the apology that breaks any negativity in the cycle of development. So I hope you will indulge me by accepting my apology even though you think it is a long time ago and small potatoes.''  I wrote back that, of course, I did.  I told my children the new ending to the story. They seemed interested; at least I didn't catch them rolling their eyes the way they do at a lot of Dad's classics. But the story has a fresh ending that I should have known from my own transgressions. It's not just something in the Bible: Over time, the pain may weigh more on the bully than the bullied.

            "fulltext": "I think I may have accidentally ended up in a pornographic film. It all began when I took a trip to Los Angeles. I suppose you could have guessed that. The story of one's adult-film debut rarely begins, ''So I went to an Amish village in Pennsylvania. . . . ''  Now, I must confess to having a pretty na\u00efve view of the world. Whenever I go to L.A., I sort of expect to end up in a movie. I mean, that seemed to be what happened whenever Laverne and Shirley or the ''Happy Days'' gang went to L.A., and both of those programs were nothing if not realistic. I still believe that the streets of L.A. are packed with celebrities. When I pick up my rental car, I expect that Nicole Richie will run into me, or that Mel Gibson will accuse me of being Jewish.  In reality, here is the type of show-business encounter I've had in L.A.: I once met John Tesh's assistant in a bar.  I also once held a party in an L.A. hotel room that was attended by Jerry Maren, one of the munchkins from ''The Wizard of Oz.'' I'll never forget that cute little munchkin waddling up to me and barking, ''Vodka and Sprite.'' When I told him we only had 7-Up, he clenched his jaw as if I'd just crossed a Lollipop Guild picket line. He gave me the skunk eye for the rest of the night.  But let's get back to the night of my film debut. My friends and I were at dinner when one of them got a call on his cell. There was a party. A crazy party. A party way too hip for us, but there was a guy who could get us in.  Obviously, I said yes. I'm always looking for things that are too good for me. When choosing a college, I wanted a ''reach'' school. As for women, I'm not looking for a soul mate -- I want a woman who's way out of my league. A woman who'll be making the mistake of her life going out with me. At my wedding, I want to overhear people pointing to the bride and whispering, ''She could do so much better.''  Somehow, I don't think that'll be a problem.  The party was way up in the Hollywood Hills. One of the things that stand out about the evening is the long, arduous climb up the hills, which in retrospect is a little strange -- you don't normally think of ascending to Hell.  We arrived at the house to find a long line of people waiting outside a gate. My friend called his contact, who sent word to the security guard to let us in. As we passed through the gate, I noticed the security guard was making the other people sign a waiver as they entered.  A waiver?  Inside, I found a crowd of people, yet no one had a drink. The women all looked as if they could've been in a M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce video . . . 15 years ago. Make that a hard 15 years ago. As for the guys, I saw a man dressed like an oil sheik handing out business cards claiming he was Bob Guccione. So on the list of Things I Wasn't Expecting to See When I Woke Up This Morning, there was that.  To make things even more surreal, a film crew was walking around taking shots of the partygoers. Like most people, when confronted with a situation that makes me uncomfortable, I like to drink heavily. Seeing as how this was a party, that shouldn't have been a problem. But hard as I looked, I couldn't find a drop of booze.  I walked out onto the balcony, searching for a keg. Instead, I found an L.A.P.D. helicopter hovering above me. Almost immediately, I was bathed in its ominous searchlight. Oh, boy.  When I walked back inside, one of my friends excitedly told me the news. We were smack dab in the middle of an adult-film shoot! It turns out a film company had rented the house, and they had shot the good stuff during the week. They then opened the house up on the weekend to get stock party footage to put in between the sex scenes.  Now do I look familiar? That's right, many of you men reading this have probably fast-forwarded past me. And in case there was any doubt that I'm a loser, consider the fact I somehow managed to end up in a sex film without actually getting to, you know, have sex. My wife-to-be can do so much better.  Sadly, I don't know the name of the film they were shooting, so I've never seen it. Yet somewhere out there exists an adult film with me in it. I may never find it, but it ain't gonna be for a lack of looking.

            "fulltext": "Q: The opening credits of your new television sitcom, ''The Sarah Silverman Program,'' include a scenic glimpse of a cemetery plot, as your voice explains that your parents are both deceased. Is that actually true? No. They're both pretty retired.  How do they feel about being knocked off in your show, which makes its debut on Comedy Central on Feb. 1? They're fine with it. It was a way to bring a little bit of pathos to a self-centered character. It's like Mr. Rogers said, There isn't anyone you couldn't love if you knew their whole story, and I figured if I added dead parents --  Even so, the show's protagonist, who is named Sarah Silverman, is not exactly Mr. Rogers's type. A model of political incorrectness, she becomes enraged when she is forced to watch a commercial for a humanitarian-aid group. Whom is she based on? I would describe her as ignorant and arrogant. The character is a lot of myself and a lot of my mother.  Much like Sacha Baron Cohen, you specialize in a kind of shock comedy that seems designed to give offense. What do you think of him? ''Borat'' was the most retarded yet most important movie I've seen in many years.  In the documentary ''The Aristocrats,'' you set a new record for outrageousness by claiming, with a straight face, ''Joe Franklin raped me,'' referring to the elderly television host. I heard that he threatened to sue you. I'm pretty sure he wasn't really mad. I think he was just milking the extra publicity.  Do you see your work as social commentary? I don't see it as anything. I try not to look at it. Deconstruction is a comedy killer.  How are things going with your comedic other, Jimmy Kimmel? Excellently! All my friends are comics, but I don't know that you would know them -- Mark Cohen, Doug Benson, Todd Glass, Todd Barry.  Why don't you have any female friends? Tig Notaro, she's a woman. She's probably one of my best friends. She's a comedian.  Tell us about your childhood in Bedford, N.H., where you were the youngest of four daughters. Isn't your oldest sister a rabbi? She got into it on her own, after grad school, even. We grew up in a place with very few Jews. I didn't look like the other kids. I had hairy legs, hairy arms, hair everywhere. I looked like a little monkey.  This doesn't sound like a description of an idyllic childhood. I wouldn't want to do it again. I had a lot of depression as a kid.  During adolescence, you mean? From 13 to 16. I didn't go to school for months. It was so awful. I didn't know how to express what it was. I remember trying to explain it to my stepdad and saying, ''I feel like that terrible homesick feeling, but I'm home.''  Were you treated at the time for depression? I had very bad experiences with doctors. I got sent to a psychiatrist who put me on Xanax when I was 13. I went back for my next visit, and he had killed himself.  That's a pretty good story, but is it true? I swear to God. I had to wait for the rest of the hour for my mom to pick me up.  You eventually wound up at New York University, where you dropped out after a year to work in comedy clubs. I didn't really drop out. I just didn't go back.  Do you wish your new show were appearing on HBO, if only because Comedy Central bleeps out the swear words? No, I spent two years developing shows at HBO, right before this. I wrote two pilots with Larry Charles. Neither of them was even shot. They're so good too.  And then you were rescued by Comedy Central. Yes, I'm one of those lucky people who's attracted to people who like me.  DEBORAH SOLOMON  THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 1-21-07: QUESTIONS FOR SARAH SILVERMAN",

Some recommended their favorite air fresheners or asked if we washed our socks. Others worried that this week's big stink was a plot of some kind -- perhaps terrorists, of course, since we always think that first now. But perhaps it was the work of somebody launching a fancy new oxygen atomizer: fresh air from the islands at only $5 a whiff.  What happened on Monday morning at 9 was that large swaths of Manhattan started to smell extremely bad. Described by most as the smell your gas stove makes when you forget to light the burner, the odor lasted about an hour. It was so bad in some areas that people decided not to go outside and smoke for fear of igniting the neighborhood.  As expected, New Jersey was quickly blamed for the foul smell. But to date, there has been no public explanation for what the stink was or where it came from. Similarly, there has been no public explanation of a very sweet smell that took over most of Manhattan in late 2005 and was described as being a very good imitation of imitation maple syrup.  The lack of answers about these smells did nothing to deter the theories. One favorite: Are the security folks testing to see what a really dangerous gas would do if released over the big city? Did somebody then map the complaint pattern to see who would go first? Or: Was this an industrial leak that nobody is acknowledging for fear of lawsuits? Or: Has air quality improved so much in New York that we can actually notice an odd smell?  It is a frightening world, and New Yorkers now know to speak up if we see, hear, sense -- or smell -- something untoward. This time the problem blew over quickly, except on the late-night comedy circuit. It was, thankfully, just a big-city stink, not an urban disaster.  Editorial",

The gentleman is Dick Martin, and once upon a time he; his comic partner, Dan Rowan; and his executive producer, George Schlatter, stared dumbfounded as a guy with stringy hair, a ukulele and a ridiculous falsetto voice auditioned for their new show, ''Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.''  ''Someone brought him in, and we thought George was putting us on, and he thought we were putting him on,'' Mr. Martin recalled. ''I stared at him and thought, 'God, that was funny, but it worked.' ''  The ukulele-strummer was Herbert Khaury, better known as Tiny Tim, and how brutally Simon Cowell and the other ''Idol'' judges would have dismissed him is frightening to contemplate. Mr. Martin and company, though, made him a ''Laugh-In'' regular -- but in small doses. Brevity, Mr. Martin said, is the key to keeping a spectacle like Tiny Tim funny, and it's why he has not been a regular watcher of ''Idol'' or similar reality shows: too much of a bad thing.  ''Good God, they're terrible,'' he said. ''We did that on purpose. But you can't do it too long, or too often.''  Mr. Martin spoke in a telephone interview coinciding with a couple of milestones: not only his birthday, but also the 40th anniversary of the creation of ''Laugh-In.'' Oh, the real 40th-anniversary hoopla will be about a year from now -- the show had its debut as a series in January 1968 -- but before that there was a test run, a pilot broadcast on NBC in 1967.  ''It didn't do much in the ratings,'' Mr. Martin recalled, ''but it got a significant amount of mail.'' That led to the series, tossed into NBC's schedule as a midseason replacement for ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''  ''By the eighth show we were the No. 1 show in the country,'' Mr. Martin said. ''No one was more surprised than NBC.''  Mr. Martin and Mr. Rowan, who died in 1987, had until ''Laugh-In'' been a fairly conventional nightclub act. The comic Tommy Noonan had introduced the two in 1952, taking Mr. Rowan, who was selling cars for a living, into the establishment in Los Angeles where Mr. Martin was tending bar. They hit it off, and hit the road.  ''We were a very inexpensive act for the club owner to buy,'' Mr. Martin recalled. ''We didn't have music. We didn't have props or anything. We had a rented tuxedo.''  Their gimmick was simple and timeless: a smart guy and (this would be Mr. Martin) a not-so-smart guy.  ''What our act basically was over the years is, he would tell me about things, and I would find everything incredulous,'' Mr. Martin said. ''And sexy.''  It worked nicely on conventional television -- the two made frequent appearances on Ed Sullivan's show and were guest hosts of Dean Martin's show for the summer of 1966. But there was nothing conventional about ''Laugh-In,'' which shattered the variety-show mold with an avalanche of gags strung together with quick cuts and catchphrases like ''Sock it to me'' that were soon on everyone's lips.  ''Our whole premise when we started it was, we had a shoebox full of cartoons from The Saturday Evening Post, Playboy, The New Yorker, and 90 percent of them were one frame,'' Mr. Martin said. ''You could tell a joke in that length of time.''  Mr. Rowan and Mr. Martin delivered some of the material, often with a ribald undercurrent. (Mr. Rowan, fretting about Mr. Martin's gaunt appearance: ''For your own good, you should pick up some weight.'' Mr. Martin: ''Shoulda been with me last night. I picked up 118 pounds.'') An assortment of no-name young troupe members (Judy Carne, Arte Johnson, Goldie Hawn, Ruth Buzzi, Flip Wilson) and big-name guests (Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Richard M. Nixon) delivered the rest.  It all zipped by at a pace that made other shows seem as if they were shot in slow motion. And though ''Laugh-In'' may share the national-phenomenon credentials of ''American Idol,'' Mr. Martin said he saw evidence of the show's pacing and film techniques in a different Fox show, one that he does watch regularly: ''24,'' the counterterrorism drama.  It's not just the short segments and the urgency; it's the challenge to the viewers to keep up. The running gags and incongruous juxtapositions of ''Laugh-In'' aren't so dissimilar from the running story lines and unnerving twists of ''24,'' and though ''Laugh-In'' is often credited with expanding what could be done on television, Mr. Martin suggested that it also expanded the definition of the audience.  ''They got it quickly,'' he said of those viewers back in the 1960s.  After ''Laugh-In'' went off the air in 1973, Mr. Martin had some success as a director, including on the sitcoms of his friend Bob Newhart. What among television's offerings makes him laugh today?  Not much.  ''I liked 'Frasier,' '' he said. But, he added a bit glumly, ''I can't find anything funny today.''",

Very light jets, private planes that seat four to six passengers and are being produced by a handful of manufacturers, are the lowest priced business or private jet, and are capable of using more than 5,000 noncommercial airports.  Proponents say the aircraft will attract new customers to private aviation, and will be the workhorses of the air-taxi business being planned by several competitors. The Eclipse 500 cost $1.52 million in 2006.  The first model was delivered to its co-owners, David Crowe and Jet-Alliance, a shared-jet operator in Westlake Village, Calif. Mr. Crowe and Jet-Alliance will share use of the plane. Eclipse said that it has 37 aircraft in various stages of assembly and has an order backlog of about 2,500.  The Federal Aviation Administration has estimated that as many as 5,000 very light jets will be in operation within 10 years.  TRANSATLANTIC BUSINESS AIRLINE -- A new discount, all-business-class transatlantic airline, L'Avion, plans to begin six-day-a-week service between Liberty International Airport in Newark and Orly in Paris.

The company offered round-trip fares of $999 for the first 1,000 customers who booked, but L'Avion said regular roundtrip fares will start at $1,599.  Two all-business-class, low-fare airlines, Eos and MaxJet, began flying the New York-London Stansted routes just over a year ago, and another all-business-class low-fare start-up, Silverjet, plans to begin service between Newark and London Luton later this month.

            "fulltext": "CLEAR, a private service that prescreens travelers for a $100 annual fee, has come to Kennedy International Airport. To benefit from the Clear Registered Traveler program, which is run by Verified Identity Pass, a person must fill out an application, let the service capture his fingerprints and iris pattern and present two forms of identification. If the traveler passes a federal background check, he will be given a card that allows him to pass quickly through airport security.  Sounds great, but it's actually two ideas rolled into one: one clever and one very stupid.  The clever idea is allowing people to pay for better service. Clear has been in operation at the Orlando International Airport since July 2005, and members have passed through security checkpoints faster simply because they are segregated from less experienced fliers who don't know the drill.  Now, at Kennedy and other airports, Clear is purchasing and installing federally approved technology that will further speed up the screening process: scanners that will eliminate the need for cardholders to remove their shoes, and explosives detection machines that will eliminate the need for them to remove their coats and jackets. There are also Clear employees at the checkpoints who, although they can't screen cardholders, can guide members through the security process. Clear has not yet paid airports for an extra security lane or the Transportation Security Administration for extra screening personnel, but both of those enhancements are on the table if enough people sign up.  I fly more than 200,000 miles per year and would gladly pay $100 a year to get through airport security faster.  But the stupid idea is the background check. When first conceived, traveler programs focused on prescreening. Pre-approved travelers would pass through security checkpoints with less screening, and resources would be focused on everyone else. Sounds reasonable, but it would leave us all less safe.  Background checks are based on the dangerous myth that we can somehow pick terrorists out of a crowd if we could identify everyone. Unfortunately, there isn't any terrorist profile that prescreening can uncover. Timothy McVeigh could probably have gotten one of these cards. So could have Eric Rudolph, the pipe bomber at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. There isn't even a good list of known terrorists to check people against; the government list used by the airlines has been the butt of jokes for years.  And have we forgotten how prevalent identity theft is these days? If you think having a criminal impersonating you to your bank is bad, wait until they start impersonating you to the Transportation Security Administration.  The truth is that whenever you create two paths through security -- a high-security path and a low-security path -- you have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to exploit the low-security path. It may be counterintuitive, but we are all safer if the people chosen for more thorough screening are truly random and not based on an error-filled database or a cursory background check.  I think of Clear as a $100 service that tells terrorists if the F.B.I. is on to them or not. Why in the world would we provide terrorists with this ability?  We don't have to. Clear cardholders are not scrutinized less when they go through checkpoints, they're scrutinized more efficiently. So why not get rid of the background checks altogether? We should all be able to walk into the airport, pay $10, and use the Clear lanes when it's worth it to us.

            "fulltext": "AFTER taking time off from work, reserving plane tickets and finding a pet sitter, the last thing travelers want to find is that their vacations have been canceled because too few people signed up for the tour. But that's what usually happened when a tour operator didn't get enough paying customers to cover the cost of a trip -- until now.  To encourage bookings and gain the trust of travelers whose trips have been canceled, a growing number of tour operators are promising to run certain tours no matter how many people sign up. The so-called guaranteed departures began showing up in the brochures of escorted-tour operators like Trafalgar Tours and Globus & Cosmos in 2005. Others quickly followed suit.  Collette Vacations, based in Pawtucket, R.I., just started offering guaranteed departure dates for trips in 2007. Travel Alliance Partners, a collection of 33 North American tour operators, put together a catalog of 64 guaranteed-to-run tours for 2006 that was so successful it rolled out another one for 2007 with 92 trips from its members. Travelers can book the trips at www.guaranteeddepartures.com. Country Walkers, a soft-adventure travel company in Waterbury, Vt., started guaranteeing departures for its 2006 itineraries paid in full 90 days before the start date.  Promising that a trip will operate on the day it is scheduled and will not be canceled for lack of participation has helped build confidence in the tour industry, which was forced to cancel many trips for that reason during the travel slump after Sept. 11, 2001.  ''Many times, people were disappointed because there were not enough in a group for the bus to go,'' said James J. Palmeri, executive director of Travel Alliance Partners. ''Individual travelers were disappointed because their vacation was canceled, tour operators were disappointed because they lost a trip they thought they had, and travel agents were disappointed because they thought they had a sale on a trip.''  Eileen Rudden, an executive at a Boston communications company, was let down after her first choice in tour operators, Backroads, of Berkeley, Calif., canceled the March trip she wanted to take to Costa Rica -- even before she had a chance to sign up.  ''I was extremely disappointed,'' said Ms. Rudden, who added that she had traveled with Backroads and enjoyed the trips. ''They had it in all their materials, and I was calling them in November for a trip in March. It made me think maybe they don't have this Costa Rica thing down.''  Backroads said it doesn't cancel trips because of low enrollment, but a small number of departures listed in its brochure are scrapped if no reservations are made after a period of time.  Ms. Rudden has since booked her vacation with Country Walkers, which is guaranteeing the departure date. Although she booked the trip based mainly on her rigid vacation schedule, Ms. Rudden said the departure guarantee ''is something of value.''  But as reassuring as they sound, guaranteed departures aren't always, well, guaranteed. Travelers who read the fine print soon learn that even though a trip may be called guaranteed, there is still a chance that their vacations could be canceled or postponed.  In some cases, this is simply good practice on the tour operator's part. Tour operators reserve the right to cancel guaranteed departures, if a major event like a war could endanger travelers. There are also circumstances outside of an operator's control.  For instance, many companies, including Travcoa, which guarantees all departure dates in its brochure, were forced to cancel trips to Libya last year after the country stopped issuing visas to American travelers. Others canceled trips to Israel when war broke out last summer.  But tour operators also reserve the right to cancel tours for financial reasons. Promising that a trip will run even when there are too few customers signed up to cover the cost of the tour means the tour operator has to absorb the balance. To avoid a potentially big loss, many companies exclude particularly expensive trips from their list of guaranteed departures.  TRAVCOA, for example, excludes trips that involve chartered boats or aircraft. Country Walkers doesn't include trips like those to Iceland, New Zealand and Chile in its guaranteed departure program because of the high costs and, sometimes, currency fluctuations associated with such trips.  Other tour operators avoid the high cost of running trips with too few participants by guaranteeing only their most popular journeys. Trafalgar, which guaranteed about 30 percent of all its journeys in its brochures this year, plans to guarantee more departure dates on its Web site as demand grows and trips start to fill up. And Globus & Cosmos, in fact, flags trips on its Web sites as ''guaranteed departures'' for travel agents, but calls those same dates ''popular departures'' on their consumer sites, www.globusjourneys.com and www.cosmos.com.  That nomenclature helps avoid an obvious question: how likely are trips to operate that aren't guaranteed? Ninety-nine percent, tour operators say.  So why offer guarantees at all? ''It gives people peace of mind,'' said John G. Severini, president of Trafalgar Tours.  And peace of mind, in turn, encourages early bookings. ''We did it to meet the demand of people wanting to book way in advance,'' he said, ''and get the early payment discount and be assured of a departure.''  Some companies, like Wilderness Travel and Mountain Travel Sobek, stay away from guaranteed departures altogether. ''It can be a bit misleading to clients,'' said Barbara Banks, a spokeswoman for Wilderness Travel, a Berkeley, Calif., company that instead offers tiered pricing, which lowers the cost of the trip per person as the number of participants grows. For example, a 15-day journey in Argentine Patagonia costs $4,995 a person if 11 or 12 people sign up, compared with $5,595 for 6 or 7.  ''We let them know that we make every effort to run the trip,'' Ms. Banks said, ''and we also let them know how much it is going to cost them.''  PRACTICAL TRAVELER | TOUR OPERATORS",

            "fulltext": "LOOKING for a cheap Caribbean getaway? With bookings up at many resorts, deep discounts are hard to find on land -- but there are plenty out at sea. Weak demand for Caribbean sailings is leading many cruise lines to slash prices -- as low as $189 for some three-night cruises -- in an effort to spur sales.  Celebrity Cruises has been advertising four-night Caribbean sailings from Miami for as low as $249 a person under ''special promotions'' on its Web site, www.celebritycruises.com. Royal Caribbean, www.royalcaribbean.com, was offering a five-night western Caribbean cruise on Splendour of the Seas, departing Feb. 3, for $297 a person. Carnival Cruise Lines, www.carnival.com, has been offering weeklong Caribbean cruises from Florida and San Juan starting at $499 a person. On top of that, the company is offering a two-category upgrade for many bookings through Feb. 15.  During the first 10 days of January, prices for more than 460 Caribbean cruises were reduced, according to SureCruise.com. Savings averaged about $74 a person, with some cutting rates by thousands of dollars.  The best bargains are for short itineraries. A recent search on Expedia.com turned up a four-night Royal Caribbean cruise to the Bahamas starting at $189 a person for an inside cabin or $239 a person for an ocean-view room. Prices are typically 10 percent less than they were last year for three- and four-night Caribbean cruises, according to Expedia, with a few as much as 30 percent off.  And because many cruise lines have been introducing new ships or refurbishing aging vessels, ''you're getting a better selection at better prices,'' said Mark Kammerer, Expedia's cruise expert.  The weak demand and subsequent discounts are being driven, in part, by reductions in disposable income for some less affluent cruise passengers and by lingering confusion over new passport rules that take effect this week. Prices for summer cruises to Alaska and Europe are about the same as last year's.  ''It's a bit of a dichotomy,'' said Tim Conder, a leisure analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons. The Caribbean cruise market, he said, consists mostly of first-time cruise passengers, who typically have lower incomes than the more experienced travelers who tend to sail outside the Caribbean.  The more affluent customers have generally felt less impact from rising interest rates on adjustable mortgages and home equity loans, while many Caribbean cruise passengers are being pinched. ''They don't have as much left over in their wallets,'' Mr. Conder said.  On Tuesday, new security rules go into effect that require Americans returning by plane from Mexico, Panama, the Caribbean and Canada to carry passports. An early draft of the rules would have required Caribbean cruise passengers to carry passports too, but after heavy lobbying by the travel industry, Congress voted to postpone the deadline for travel by sea. Before that decision was made, however, many would-be travelers who didn't have passports made other plans.  An increase in outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness -- including two recent occurrences during Caribbean sailings on the world's largest cruise ship, Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas -- hasn't helped demand, either. There were 33 outbreaks aboard cruise ships last year, more than in any other year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks outbreaks that affect 3 percent or more of either passengers or crew members. And norovirus, the highly contagious group of viruses that can cause a miserable one- or two-day bout of vomiting, diarrhea and cramping, was either confirmed or suspected in nearly every case.  Though often associated with cruise ships because it thrives in close quarters and because cruise lines are required by law to report all gastrointestinal illnesses onboard, the risk of contracting norovirus is hardly confined to ships. It is the most common cause of such illness in North America, sickening an estimated 23 million Americans each year. The rise in shipboard outbreaks is associated with the rise in passengers sailing on more ships at sea, which increases the risk for spread of illness between passengers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.  Cruise companies say they clean ''high-touch'' areas of ships like banisters and elevator buttons several times a day if there is an outbreak and offer sick passengers rebates if they promise to stay in their rooms. Some cruise lines even question passengers before boarding to see if they have any symptoms.  But such measures can't prevent a sick passenger from knowingly or unknowingly coming aboard and infecting others. After more than 380 people on the Freedom of the Seas were sickened by norovirus during a Caribbean cruise Nov. 26 to Dec. 3, the ship was cleaned and subsequently inspected by the Centers for Disease Control. Even so, more passengers and crew members fell ill on the next trip, the following week. (The best defense against catching a stomach bug aboard ship is simple: keep washing your hands.)  Thinking of booking? Don't wait too long. While cruise deals to the Caribbean could linger, planes that carry passengers to the port cities are filling up quickly, pushing air fares higher. Average January air fares to and from many big ports are up compared with those a year earlier, according to Sabre Airline Solutions -- by 3 percent to Tampa and Orlando, Fla., 9 percent to Miami, and 10 percent to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where many Caribbean cruises depart.  ''The earlier you book, the easier it is to get all the accommodations you want,'' said Mark Kammerer of Expedia. ''People who wait until the last minute typically ''don't get the flexibility on dates of departures, itinerary, ships or cabin that meet all their needs.''  Among the most coveted are rooms with balconies, Mr. Kammerer said, which allow passengers to sit outside their own rooms and ''have the sea go by.''  PRACTICAL TRAVELER: CARIBBEAN CRUISES",

Lukashenko of Belarus said that energy conservation had become a national security priority. Belarus long enjoyed discounted prices for energy from Russia, subsidizing its industries and generating profits from the refining and export of gasoline and other oil products. Russia more than doubled the price of natural gas -- $100 per cubic meter, compared with $46 -- beginning Jan. 1. Belarus imposed a retaliatory fee on the transit of oil, but backed down last week after Russia turned off its main oil pipeline through Belarus, disrupting supplies across Europe. Mr. Lukashenko appeared to be bracing the country for austerity as energy-saving measures are adopted. ''The next three, four years will not be an easy time,'' he said, according to Interfax, ''but we will have to bear it.''  STEVEN LEE MYERS",

Unlike Ukraine, Belarus blinked two minutes before the Jan. 1 deadline and Russia had its booty: a 50 percent share of Belarus's pipeline network and a more than doubling of the price Belarus will now pay for Russian gas.  There was no global outcry this time. President Aleksandr Lukashenko, the utterly Soviet boss of Belarus, has no friends in the West. But this latest squeeze is another warning that the Kremlin will let nothing -- personal loyalty, contracts, the law -- halt its drive to reimpose state control on Russia's energy sector. It is also another reminder that the West, a big consumer of Russian energy, remains vulnerable to President Vladimir Putin's whims.  The Belarus deal came less than two weeks after Royal Dutch Shell gave in to the Kremlin's pressure and sold a controlling share in the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project to Gazprom, Russia's state gas monopoly. Moscow is now leaning on the British-Russian joint venture, TNK-BP, to give Gazprom a large and possibly controlling stake.  A year ago, when the democratic revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine were seen as serious threats to the Kremlin's influence, Mr. Putin was eager to prop up Mr. Lukashenko. But once Mr. Lukashenko successfully stole the March presidential election, the new gas bill arrived in Minsk. That included half ownership for the Kremlin of Beltransgaz, the state pipeline operator that not only fuels Belarus but also supplies a fifth of Europe's gas.  Russia's European customers could increase their leverage -- and possibly improve the Kremlin's behavior -- if they negotiated jointly with Gazprom, rather than scurrying to cut separate deals. Western companies and governments also need to warn Moscow that its leverage has limits. Russia will need the expertise and capital of foreign companies if it wants to keep developing its natural resources. No one wants to do business with a bully.  Editorial",

Fradkov, announced that Russia had agreed to lower significantly an export duty on oil to Belarus. Russia had imposed a duty of $180 per ton on oil shipped to Belarus, but agreed to lower it to $53 after the conflict prompted a halt in supplies to Europe through the Druzhba, or Friendship, pipeline, according to news accounts. Belarus on Wednesday agreed to drop a tit-for-tat fee it had imposed in response to Russia's new duty, causing Russia to close the pipeline. Belarus has refined subsidized Russian oil and resold it at significant profit. Belarus will continue to receive a subsidy, but Mr. Fradkov said the new agreement, which appeared to end the dispute between the countries, would still raise $1 billion for Russia.

            "fulltext": "Supplies of Russian crude oil headed to European markets came to a halt overnight, officials said Monday, in the latest manifestation of rapidly deteriorating relations between Russia and Belarus.  The head of Russia's oil pipeline monopoly accused Belarus of illegally siphoning oil beginning Saturday in an escalating dispute over duties and transit fees. Belarus's foreign ministry acknowledged the halt but denied responsibility, suggesting that the Russians had instead caused the stoppage at their common border.  Regardless of the cause, the disruption along the Druzhba, or Friendship, pipeline affected supplies of crude oil headed to Poland, Germany and Ukraine. In the short term, at least, the halt should have a minimal effect, because refineries in those countries maintain reserves. In the longer term as well, the disruption is not as threatening as a shut-off of natural gas, because alternative sources of oil are more readily available.  Still, a prolonged disruption could be worrisome. Oil prices rose on the news, and the dispute rekindled concerns in Europe about the reliability of energy supplies from Russia.  ''This shows us once again that arguments among various countries of the former Soviet Union, between suppliers and transit countries, mean that these deliveries are unreliable from our perspective,'' Poland's deputy economics minister, Piotr Naimski, said in televised remarks, according to The Associated Press.  The shutdown of Druzhba, one of the highest-capacity pipelines in the world, took place a week after Russia and Belarus negotiated a last-minute agreement that sharply raised the price Belarus would have to pay for natural gas. The deal came after brinkmanship by each side that raised the specter of disruptions of natural gas deliveries across Europe, like one that followed a dispute between Ukraine and Russia in 2006.  Belarus, led by an autocratic president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, has reacted furiously to the terms of that deal and to Russia's tactics in the talks that led to it. Last week, Belarus called Russia's conduct shameless.  Russia has responded by saying that it is simply raising the costs of oil and gas to market prices. Belarus and other former republics of the Soviet Union have long bought oil and gas at a discount, compared with European customers.  ''Belarus has cast prudence to the wind,'' Andrei V. Sharonov, a deputy economic development minister, said in remarks on the Moscow radio station Ekho Moskvy, referring to what he, too, called the illegal siphoning of oil. ''This looks like a trade war.''  He later said that Russia would suspend all oil shipments through Belarus, blaming it for the initial disruptions. His remarks suggested that the disruption could last indefinitely.  For the last decade, Russia and Belarus, two countries bound by history and deep ethnic, cultural and social ties, have moved haltingly toward the creation of a union, with a common currency and even, ultimately, the creation of a single unified state, as negotiated in a 1996 treaty between Mr. Lukashenko and President Boris N. Yeltsin.  The union has never come to fruition under President Vladimir V. Putin. In the past month, the two countries have seemed instead to be negotiating the terms of their divorce, which, like many, is becoming nasty.  Beginning New Year's Day, Russia began charging Belarus $100 per thousand cubic meters of natural gas, compared with the $46 it charged last year. The price is to increase steadily to the level charged in Europe -- now $265 on average -- by 2011.  As those negotiations dragged on bitterly, Russia also imposed a separate duty of $180 a ton on oil it sold to Belarus, which has been sold at steeply subsidized prices. Mr. Lukashenko's government responded to the oil duty last week by announcing a $45 a metric ton fee on shipping oil across Belarus on its way to other parts of Europe.  These are the fees are at the heart of the dispute that has shut down the pipeline.  Mr. Sharonov, in his radio interview, said Mr. Lukashenko's government had begun seizing the oil as payment for the transit fee.  The head of Russia's pipeline monopoly, Semyon M. Vainshtok, said in a statement that Belarus had siphoned 79,900 metric tons of oil since Saturday ''without warning anyone.''  He said, ''Transit is a sacred cow,'' and vowed to use other means of transport to supply customers in Europe.  On Sunday, prosecutors in Belarus filed suit against Mr. Vainshtok, accusing him of having violated customs duties by not paying the new transit fee. A hearing scheduled for Monday, however, was canceled.  In Belarus, there were conflicting reports about what had unfolded. While the foreign ministry denied responsibility, an official from the Druzhba pipeline told Russian news agencies that operations had been halted on orders from Belneftekhim, the Belarus pipeline monopoly. Neither the ministry nor the companies would elaborate.  Belarus has used its cheap supplies of oil and gas to shore up a Soviet-style economy and earn hard currency, in the case of oil, by exporting refined products at world prices. For Mr. Lukashenko's government, the changing economics could weaken his iron control on the country of 10 million.  ''The Belarussian people may not realize the extent to which they have been propped up by Russian energy, the extent to which the Belarussian miracle that Lukashenko talks about was built on legs of clay,'' said Rory MacFarquhar, an economist with Goldman Sachs in Moscow.  The impact in Belarus, where the news media is tightly controlled by the state, remains uncertain.  Pavel Daneyko, the director of the Institute for Privatization and Management, a business consultancy in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, said Mr. Lukashenko's government faced two difficult options: a liberalization of the country's economy or a populist propaganda war against Russia.  ''If there is a clear war with Russia,'' he said by telephone, ''then the society may be able to weather the situation.''",

            "fulltext": "Renewing concerns about whether there will be enough corn to support the demand for both fuel and food, a new study has found that ethanol plants could use as much as half of America's corn crop next year.  Dozens of new ethanol plants are being built by farmers and investors in a furious gold rush, spurred by a call last year from the Bush administration and politicians from farm states to produce more renewable fuels to curb America's reliance on oil. But the new study by the Earth Policy Institute, an environmental group, found that the number of ethanol plants coming on line has been underreported by more than 25 percent by both the Agriculture Department and the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry's main lobbying group.  The Earth Policy Institute says that 79 ethanol plants are under construction, which would more than double ethanol production capacity to 11 billion gallons by 2008. Yet late last month, the Renewable Fuels Association said there were 62 plants under construction.  The lower tally has led to an underestimate of the grain that would be needed for ethanol, clouding the debate over the priorities of allocating corn for food and fuel, said Lester R. Brown, who has written more than a dozen books on environmental issues and is the president of the Earth Policy Institute. ''This unprecedented diversion of corn to fuel production will affect food prices everywhere,'' Mr. Brown said.  Bob Dinneen, the president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the group had not intentionally tried to play down the number of plants under construction. ''It has been a moving target,'' Mr. Dinneen said in an interview on Thursday. ''We are not trying to hide the ball. We are trying to keep up with a growing and dynamic industry as best we can.''  The Renewable Fuels Association has generally played down concerns in the food versus fuel debate over ethanol, saying that estimates showed there would be plenty of corn to meet the demand for both. ''We can absolutely do that without having a deleterious impact on consumer food prices,'' Mr. Dinneen said.  The National Corn Growers Association said Thursday that farmers were keeping up, noting that growers produced their third-largest crop in 2006 of 10.7 billion bushels. ''All demands for corn -- food, feed, fuel and exports -- are being met,'' Rick Tolman, chief executive of the corn growers, said in a statement. ''Farmers have always responded to price signals from the marketplace and, historically, we have had much more challenge with overproduction than shortage.''  With spot prices of corn soaring to record highs of nearly $4 a bushel last month, farmers are expected to plant some 85 million acres of corn this year, an increase of 8 percent over 2006 and what would be the largest corn-seeding in the country since 1985, said Dan Basse, president of AgResource, an agricultural research company in Chicago.  Ethanol has raised the incomes of farmers and given new hope to flagging rural economies. But the reliance on corn to produce ethanol in the United States has drawn concerns from some economists, who question whether the drive to corn-based fuel will push up the prices of livestock and retail prices of meat, poultry and dairy products.  Mr. Brown is among those who believe the ethanol industry is growing too quickly. He called for a federal moratorium on the licensing of new distilleries. ''We need a time out, a chance to catch our breath and decide how much corn can be used for ethanol without raising food prices,'' he said Thursday.  Like many other experts, he advocates moving past corn-based ethanol into cellulosic ethanol, produced from plant waste and nonfood crops like switch grass.  For now, however, in the anticipation of high potential returns, ethanol plants that rely on corn are being built by everyone from farmers to Bill Gates of Microsoft to a mix of Wall Street investors. In addition to the 116 ethanol plants in production, and the 79 under construction, at least 200 more ethanol plants, with a capacity of 3 billion gallons a year, are in the planning stages.  In all, ethanol distilleries now running or in the works will pull an estimated 139 million tons of corn from the 2008 corn harvest, according to the Earth Policy Institute. That is about double the demand projected by the Agriculture Department and will require over half of the projected 2008 corn harvest of about 11 billion bushels.  Keith Collins, the Agriculture Department's chief economist, did not respond to requests for comment. One reason for the department's projection of just 60 million tons of corn used for ethanol is that it was released last February, before surging oil prices set off investor interest in ethanol plants. The Agriculture Department will release its new projections next month.  But the pace of plant construction may be slowing. Shortages of galvanized steel and backlogs for special tanks for the distilleries have pushed construction time back from 18 months to as much as 28 months for some plants, Mr. Basse said.  Some towns are also demanding environmental studies to better understand the impact ethanol plants can have on water supplies and quality of the groundwater, which has delayed permits for new processing plants.",

            "fulltext": "Just a few years ago, politicians and environmental groups in the Netherlands were thrilled by the early and rapid adoption of ''sustainable energy,'' achieved in part by coaxing electrical plants to use biofuel -- in particular, palm oil from Southeast Asia.  Spurred by government subsidies, energy companies became so enthusiastic that they designed generators that ran exclusively on the oil, which in theory would be cleaner than fossil fuels like coal because it is derived from plants.  But last year, when scientists studied practices at palm plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia, this green fairy tale began to look more like an environmental nightmare.  Rising demand for palm oil in Europe brought about the clearing of huge tracts of Southeast Asian rainforest and the overuse of chemical fertilizer there.  Worse still, the scientists said, space for the expanding palm plantations was often created by draining and burning peatland, which sent huge amounts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.  Considering these emissions, Indonesia had quickly become the world's third-leading producer of carbon emissions that scientists believe are responsible for global warming, ranked after the United States and China, according to a study released in December by researchers from Wetlands International and Delft Hydraulics, both in the Netherlands.  ''It was shocking and totally smashed all the good reasons we initially went into palm oil,'' said Alex Kaat, a spokesman for Wetlands, a conservation group.  The production of biofuels, long a cornerstone of the quest for greener energy, may sometimes create more harmful emissions than fossil fuels, scientific studies are finding.  As a result, politicians in many countries are rethinking the billions of dollars in subsidies that have indiscriminately supported the spread of all of these supposedly eco-friendly fuels for vehicles and factories. The 2003 European Union Biofuels Directive, which demands that all member states aim to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010, is now under review.  ''If you make biofuels properly, you will reduce greenhouse emissions,'' said Peder Jensen, of the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen. ''But that depends very much on the types of plants and how they're grown and processed. You can end up with a 90 percent reduction compared to fossil fuels -- or a 20 percent increase.''  He added, ''It's important to take a life-cycle view,'' and not to ''just see what the effects are here in Europe.''  In the Netherlands, the data from Indonesia has provoked soul-searching, and helped prompt the government to suspend palm oil subsidies. The Netherlands, a leader in green energy, is now leading the effort to distinguish which biofuels are truly environmentally sound.  The government, environmental groups and some of the Netherlands' ''green energy'' companies are trying to develop programs to trace the origins of imported palm oil, to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner.  Krista van Velzen, a member of Parliament, said the Netherlands should pay compensation to Indonesia for the damage that palm oil has caused. ''We can't only think: does it pollute the Netherlands?''  In the United States and Brazil most biofuel is ethanol (made from corn in the United States and sugar in Brazil), used to power vehicles made to run on gasoline. In Europe it is mostly local rapeseed and sunflower oil, used to make diesel fuel.  In a small number of instances, plant oil is used in place of diesel fuel, without further refinement. But as many European countries push for more green energy, they are increasingly importing plant oils from the tropics, since there is simply not enough plant matter for fuel production at home.  On the surface, the environmental equation that supports biofuels is simple: Since they are derived from plants, biofuels absorb carbon while they are grown and release it when they are burned. In theory that neutralizes their emissions.  But the industry was promoted long before there was adequate research, said Reanne Creyghton, who runs Friends of the Earth's campaign against palm oil here.  Biofuelswatch, an environment group in Britain, now says that ''biofuels should not automatically be classed as renewable energy.'' It supports a moratorium on subsidies until more research can determine whether various biofuels in different regions are produced in a nonpolluting manner.  Beyond that, the group suggests that all emissions arising from the production of a biofuel be counted as emissions in the country where the fuel is actually used, providing a clearer accounting of environmental costs.  The demand for palm oil in Europe has soared in the last two decades, first for use in food and cosmetics, and more recently for fuel. This versatile and cheap oil is used in about 10 percent of supermarket products, from chocolate to toothpaste, accounting for 21 percent of the global market for edible oils.  Palm oil produces the most energy of all vegetable oils for each unit of volume when burned. In much of Europe it is used as a substitute for diesel fuel, though in the Netherlands, the government has encouraged its use for electricity.  Supported by hundreds of millions of euros in national subsidies, the Netherlands rapidly became the leading importer of palm oil in Europe, taking in 1.7 million tons last year, nearly double the previous year.  The increasing demand has created damage far away. Friends of the Earth estimates that 87 percent of the deforestation in Malaysia from 1985 to 2000 was caused by new palm oil plantations. In Indonesia, the amount of land devoted to palm oil has increased 118 percent in the last eight years.  In December, scientists from Wetlands International released their calculations about the global emissions caused by palm farming on peatland.  Peat is an organic sponge that stores huge amounts of carbon, helping balance global emissions. Peatland is 90 percent water. But when it is drained, the Wetlands International scientists say, the stored carbon gases are released into the atmosphere.  To makes matters worse, once dried, peatland is often burned to clear ground for plantations. The Dutch study estimated that the draining of peatland in Indonesia releases 660 million ton of carbon a year into the atmosphere and that fires contributed 1.5 billion tons annually.  The total is equivalent to 8 percent of all global emissions caused annually by burning fossil fuels, the researchers said. ''These emissions generated by peat drainage in Indonesia were not counted before,'' said Mr. Kaat. ''It was a totally ignored problem.'' For the moment Wetlands is backing the certification system for palm oil imports.  But some environmental groups say palm oil cannot be produced sustainably at reasonable prices. They say palm oil is now cheap because of poor environmental practices and labor abuses.  ''Yes, there have been bad examples in the palm oil industry,'' said Arjen Brinkman, a company official at Biox, a young company that plans to build three palm oil electrical plants in Holland, using oil from palms grown on its own plantations in a manner that it says is responsible.  ''But it is now clear,'' he said, ''that to serve Europe's markets for biofuel and bioenergy, you will have to prove that you produce it sustainably -- that you are producing less, not more CO2.''",

To encourage drilling when oil prices were low, Congress waived many royalties for companies drilling in very deep water. But the ''royalty relief'' was supposed to stop if oil cost more than $34 a barrel, when deepwater drilling was assumed to be profitable.  A year ago, the minerals agency admitted what midlevel officials had known for six years: that it had signed leases in 1998 and 1999 allowing oil companies drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to escape $7 billion to $10 billion in royalties over the next five years -- even if energy prices remain at record levels. The giveaway came from a mistake made under President Bill Clinton, but Bush administration senior officials ignored it as oil prices shot to new highs. Last week, Interior's inspector general, Earl E. Devaney, called the agency's response ''shockingly cavalier'' and ''a jaw dropping example of bureaucratic bungling.''  There are investigations by Congress, the inspector general at Interior and the Justice Department into alleged mismanagement, poor oversight of oil companies and possibly even criminal misbehavior.  The agency is also accused of lax oversight of oil company payments. Four of its own auditors have accused superiors of blocking findings that major companies cheated the government.

            "fulltext": "An unyielding President Vladimir V. Putin on Tuesday raised the possibility of diverting oil transit routes away from Belarus, a day after Moscow cut off pipeline deliveries of crude oil headed to customers in Eastern and Central Europe through the country.  Such a change, which would be years in the making, would cut Belarus out of any role in the transshipment of oil to Europe without offering the customers any immediate assurance that their supplies were reliable.  The two-day cutoff has affected supplies to Ukraine, Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is the second stoppage of Russian energy supplies to European countries since last winter, when natural gas shipments were shut down briefly during a gas pricing dispute between Russia and Ukraine.  In a meeting with his cabinet ministers, Mr. Putin also urged the government to discuss with Russian companies ''the possibility of scaling down the extraction of oil, given problems in transiting crude across Belarus.'' That indicated that Russia might not have sufficient storage for oil that was being produced but not exported.  With the new year, Russia began charging Belarus $100 per thousand cubic meters of gas, more than double the old rate of $46. It also imposed a duty of $180 a ton on oil that officials said Belarus was obtaining at subsidized rates and reselling on world markets. In response, Belarus imposed a transshipment fee of $45 a ton on oil going through Belarus in the Druzhba pipeline to Europe.  On Monday, officials in Moscow accused Belarus of siphoning off about 79,000 tons -- roughly half a million barrels -- of Russian oil bound for Europe, then shut down the pipeline entirely.  Normally the 2,500-mile pipeline pumps 1.2 million barrels a day to Eastern and Central Europe, with one arm running to Poland and Germany and the other to Ukraine, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.  In general terms, Mr. Putin told his cabinet members to do whatever was necessary to guarantee the interests of Russian companies as well as the interests of the countries dependent on Russian energy supplies.  He also said the government must continue negotiations with Russia's ''Belarussian partners,'' but it is unclear when those talks will begin. Russian officials have begun formulating their starting positions, but German O. Gref, Russia's trade minister, told reporters Tuesday evening that Moscow would start talks only after Belarus had lifted transit duties and resumed oil transit.  Russia's intransigence irritated European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who said it was ''not acceptable'' for energy suppliers to cut off shipments without consultation, and who renewed her call for diversification of supplies.  But few analysts expected the standoff to last more than a few days. ''Belarus's reserves of cheap oil will last a few days, a week at most,'' Yaroslav Romanchuk, an economist in Belarus, told The Associated Press. ''After that, it will have to buy oil taking into account Russian export duties.''  In a news conference, the Russian industry and energy minister, Viktor B. Khristenko, said that in time Russia would be able to reroute oil around Belarus, possibly by increasing the capacity of the Baltic pipeline system or hurrying the completion of the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline. In the short term, he said, Russia might have to ship more oil by rail and river. ''If these measures aren't enough, it could be necessary to reduce oil output,'' he said.",

Technicians had to knock out a giant door from a testing facility to fit modern wind turbine blades, which now stick out like a bare toe from an old sock.  The hopes for this neglected lab brightened a bit just over a year ago when President Bush made the first presidential call on the lab since Mr. Carter and spelled out a vision for the not-too-distant future in which solar and wind power would help run every American home and cars would operate on biofuels made from residues of plants.  But one year after the president's visit, the money flowing into the nation's primary laboratory for developing renewable fuels is actually less than it was at the beginning of the Bush administration. The lab's fitful history reflects a basic truth: Americans may have a growing love affair with renewables and the idea of cutting oil imports and conserving energy, but it is a fickle one.  Riding that wave, the new House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, just promised committee hearings on how lawmakers could help limit climate change and enhance energy independence; Congressional Democrats pledged to find more research dollars for clean energy. [And President Bush, in his State of the Union address, called for greater federal mandates to increase use of homegrown alternative fuels.]  But the intertwined goals of developing domestic energy resources and reducing global warming gases are not necessarily in step with each other. Despite a lot of promises, no one so far has wanted to pay the extra costs to make wind and solar more than a trivial energy source. Research is uncertain and expensive, and the benefits seem far away.  So while all kinds of domestic energy technologies are being advanced in the name of energy independence, most of the money and attention are still focused on the dirty but cheaper standbys: offshore oil, oil sands and coal, in all its various incarnations, from straight out of the pit to black-coal liquid.  ''You have fossil fuels competing with renewable fuels,'' said Benjamin Kroposki, a senior scientist at the Renewable Energy Laboratory. ''Renewables lose every time.''  One example is the shotgun approach to tax incentives, loan guarantees and other spending in the 2005 energy act, the first major energy legislation enacted by Congress in a decade: $13.1 billion for oil, gas and coal, $12 billion for nuclear energy and $7.7 billion divided up among a wide assortment of renewables like ethanol, hydroelectric, wind and solar.  Now that they are in control of Congress, Democrats have promised to increase the amount going to renewable energy sources, taking the money from tax breaks for oil companies.  But even additional money for renewable energy will be going up against government tax policies that encourage more energy consumption. Companies can still deduct purchases of sport utility vehicles and utility bills, for example, while consumers get a break to build bigger homes with deductions for interest payments on mortgages, even on second homes, that far outweigh their energy saving credits.  Meanwhile, fuel efficiency standards for automobiles have changed only slightly over the decades, and the federal government still does not have a building code to encourage energy efficiency.  It is a policy mix that goes back many administrations and appears difficult to shake, partly because dirty sources of energy like coal and shale are what the United States has in abundance.  ''We are going dirtier,'' said Amy Jaffe, an energy expert at the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. ''If you need to come up with a fuel source other than drilling for oil under the ground in the Middle East, what is the most obvious thing with today's economy, today's infrastructure and today's technology? Oil shale, liquefied coal and tar sands. It's all dirty but it's fast.''  Renewable energy today supplies only 6 percent of the country's energy needs, and much of that comes from decades-old dams supplying hydropower. Under current policies, the Energy Information Administration estimates, renewables will increase only slightly in importance in the decades ahead. They would supply 7 percent of United States energy supplies by 2030, while coal would increase over the same period from 23 percent to 26 percent.  ''Denmark gets 22 percent of its electrical energy from wind today and we get 0.5 percent,'' noted Robert Thresher, director of the lab's National Wind Technology Center. ''That shows you what you can do when you really want to.''  Meanwhile imports of oil and gas are set to continue to rise in the decades ahead, as domestic production slows and the population grows.  ''The current trends do not seem sustainable,'' said Faith Birol, chief economist of the International Energy Agency. ''For me the most important thing that is missing from current consideration is an increase in vehicle fuel efficiency.''  As they have in the past, higher prices for oil and gas have driven the renewed interest in alternative energy sources. With prices falling, some of that momentum may falter.  Still, President Bush advanced his call last year to end the nation's oil addiction, providing some of the strongest rhetoric since President Carter called energy independence the moral equivalent of war.  [Mr. Bush set a goal of reducing gas use by 20 percent in the next 10 years. ''To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017; this is nearly five times the current target,'' he said Tuesday night.  [On Wednesday the administration sought to put some teeth into the goal by proposing $1.6 billion in new financing for renewable energy, with a focus on research and production of ''cellulosic'' energy from nonfood crops and agricultural waste.]  The Democratic Congress appears ready to put clean energy front and center in its agenda.  Prominent Democrats are talking about doubling the budget of the renewable energy lab, and otherwise greatly increase the priority of producing clean energy.  ''You've got to invest in this new energy future that everybody pays lip service to, but when push comes to shove do we really stand there?'' said Representative Mark Udall of Colorado, a senior Democratic spokesman on energy issues. ''This is the country's economic future not to mention the national security ramifications.''  Institutional investments in private clean energy companies in North America and Europe are rising quickly, from $500 million in 2004 to $1.3 billion in 2005 to $2.7 billion in 2006, according to Venture Business Research, an independent group based in Britain.  But even while top energy companies are also beginning to invest significant amounts in wind, solar and plants, those investments pale in comparison with the resources they are pouring into making synthetic fuels out of oil sands, a process that emits significantly more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.  Likewise energy companies are stepping up research and investments into oil sands, deep-ocean oil and gas drilling, and gasifying and liquefying coal -- all with significant environmental consequences.  For instance, Royal Dutch Shell has invested $1 billion over the last five years in clean energy like biofuels for transportation, solar and wind for electrical generation and hydrogen. That is one of the biggest commitments to clean energy by any company, but it is less than one fifth of what Shell invested over roughly the same period with Chevron and another partner in a giant oil sand mining project in Canada.  The companies say they can contain emissions through a process called carbon capture and sequestration. But most experts say development of technologies to bury significant amounts of carbon gases effectively could take decades.  At the lab here, signs of change are mixed. Last year, the institution opened its first building in a decade, although meager budgets could leave its main laboratory as much as 80 percent vacant of equipment for the next several years unless Congress suddenly comes to the rescue.  Congressional earmarks that redirected Energy Department financing last year slowed or even shelved many research projects, including ones to develop bigger and more efficient wind turbines, to make hydrogen power out of a mix of algae and water, and to plant matter.  Its scientists are also doing ground-breaking work on finding environmentally benign ways of generating electricity to produce hydrogen from water to power cars; they are working on new materials and designs to make devices powered by solar cells cheaper; and they are developing enzymes and more efficient machinery to convert switchgrass and corn stalks into biofuels to reduce oil consumption.  When Chevron decided last year that it wanted to develop the next generation of ethanol and renewable plant-based diesel fuels from trees and agricultural waste, it turned to the lab here for a scientific partnership. Now Chevron and scientists from the federal laboratory are working to make hydrogen energy out of decomposed plants. DuPont, Cargill and the National Corn Growers Association look to the lab for help in producing ethanol.  But it is hardly the kind of crash program that government labs have conducted in the past to build an atomic bomb or go to the moon. Rather, the lab gingerly hands over slices of its yearly budget of $200 million to a smorgasbord of programs in solar, wind, plant matter, geothermal, hydrogen and fuel cells, efficient buildings, advanced vehicles and fuels and electric infrastructure.  ''Our budget is nothing compared to the price of a B2 bomber or an aircraft carrier,'' Rob Farrington, manager of the lab's advanced vehicle systems group, said.

            "fulltext": "As a New Year's deadline arrived, Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, struck a deal early Monday to supply gas to Belarus for the next five years, averting a price dispute that threatened to disrupt supplies to Europe, the company said in a statement.  The agreement, reached as the Russian capital celebrated the New Year with rolling displays of fireworks, more than doubled the price that Belarus will pay for natural gas this year and raised it significantly in the years to come.  For Belarus, a close ally of Russia, the price of gas would rise to $100 per thousand cubic meters in 2007, from $46 now, and increase steadily to the level paid by European countries by 2011, the company said.  Gazprom, Russia's largest company, succeeded in achieving, at least in part, what its officials had described as a central goal: ending subsidized supplies of energy to the countries of the former Soviet Union. Belarus, led by its autocratic president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, has for years benefited from the comparatively inexpensive supply of natural gas, a vital part of its sclerotic economy, still mostly managed by the state.  The agreement headed off a shutdown of supplies to Belarus and beyond, avoiding the disruptions of last year, when the effects of a price dispute with Ukraine rippled throughout Europe and raised concerns about Russia's reliability as an energy supplier.  Gazprom, closely allied to the Kremlin, threatened to cut off gas supplies again beginning Monday at 10 a.m. if Belarus did not agree to the higher prices. At least 20 percent of Russian natural gas destined for Europe passes through Belarus, less than the amount that transits Ukraine but enough to raise new concerns in Europe.  The agreement was reached after months of negotiations -- and a final week of threats and counterthreats. Belarus's prime minister, Sergei S. Sidorsky, arrived in Moscow on Sunday for a last round of negotiations and announced the deal with Gazprom's chairman, Aleksei B. Miller. Mr. Miller had suggested that Belarus should ultimately pay the going market price, now roughly $260 per thousand cubic meters of gas.  The agreed price, $100 per thousand cubic meters, was less than the $105 that Gazprom had demanded in the past few days. But under the deal announced on Monday, Gazprom, in keeping with its stated goals of expanding its export empire, will acquire 50 percent of Beltranzgaz, the Belarussian gas-transit monopoly that distributes gas through the country.  Mr. Lukashenko, whose rule has been described as the last dictatorship in Europe, had previously vowed never to give up control of those pipelines. On Friday, he vowed that Belarussians would rather live in unheated dugouts than pay the higher prices that Gazprom was demanding. ''All this means destruction of our relations,'' he said.  A statement by Mr. Sidorsky early Monday appeared to reflect his government's unease with the agreement. ''The Belarussian side, in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year, signed an agreement on unfortunate terms,'' he said, according to Agence France-Presse.  Russia has long been the country's most reliable partner, shielding it from efforts by Europe and the United States to isolate Mr. Lukashenko, who won re-election to a third term as president in balloting in March that was denounced as unfair. But the negotiations suggested that Russia's political priorities had been surpassed by Gazprom's economic ones.",

            "fulltext": "President Bush never used the phrase ''energy independence'' in his State of the Union address last week, and it is just as well. His program for cutting gasoline demand is ambitious in scope, but modest in effect, according to experts.  The reason is that the United States has fallen down a very deep well, and it's hard to get out. Last year, the United States imported 60 percent of the oil it consumed. If, as Mr. Bush proposes, we cut gasoline consumption 20 percent by 2017 -- about 2.1 million barrels a day -- then the share of oil imported will fall only by 4 or 5 percentage points.  In fact, the government expects the share of imported oil to fall anyway, to less than 56 percent, because of a rise in domestic production, mostly from the Gulf Coast.  Domestic production has fallen sharply since the mid-1970s, but the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the Energy Department, expects production to rise to almost six million barrels a day by 2017, up from a little over five million barrels a day now.  Mr. Bush is also proposing an increase in fuel-economy standards and an increase in the production of ethanol and other gasoline substitutes, hoping to keep oil consumption relatively steady. Without such intervention, oil consumption is forecast to rise to just over 23 million barrels a day in 2017, from nearly 21 million barrels a day today.  ''It's an enormous challenge,'' said John Felmy, the chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association.  Production of ethanol from corn has already put pressure on food prices, according to some agriculture experts, but Mr. Bush's plan involves tripling the production of corn ethanol, and making huge amounts of ethanol from cellulose, which is not now done commercially.  Integrating that much ethanol into the fuel supply will involve many more rail-tanker cars or trucks, because ethanol cannot be shipped in conventional pipelines. In addition, the gasoline formula with which it is mixed has to be changed, or the mixture evaporates too easily, causing air pollution.  The actual amount of ethanol produced will depend on what is technically feasible and on the price of oil. But at the rate of change suggested by the Bush plan, energy independence is about a century away.  The Basics",

            "fulltext": "The Bush administration, accused of failing to collect billions of dollars from companies that drill for oil and gas in federal waters, announced on Tuesday that it would demand higher royalties on all new deepwater leases in the Gulf of Mexico.  The Interior Department said it would raise the royalty rate to 16.7 percent from 12.5 percent of oil and gas sales, a change that it estimated would increase government revenue by $4.5 billion over 20 years.  ''Increased royalty rates will ensure that during this time of high energy prices the American public receives its fair share of the value of oil and gas,'' said Gary Strasburg, a spokesman for the department.  But the change will not alter any of the thousands of existing offshore leases, nor will it affect a mistake in hundreds of leases that could allow companies to escape as much as $10 billion in royalties over the next five years.  The Interior Department has been trying to renegotiate those leases for the last six months, but has managed to reach voluntary agreements with only 5 of the 56 companies that hold them. Two of the biggest players in the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron and Exxon Mobil, have refused to sign new deals.  Next week, House Democrats hope to pass legislation that would punish companies that refuse to renegotiate, either by imposing a stiff new tax on their production or by prohibiting them from acquiring new leases.  ''Raising the royalty rates will do nothing to help the situation unless this administration expresses a true commitment to actually collecting these payments,'' said Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. ''The oil and gas royalties system is broken and needs to be fixed.''  In a separate decision, the Bush administration announced that it might lift a longstanding prohibition on drilling in Bristol Bay, an area off the coast of Alaska that is part of the North Aleutian Basin. The area has been closed to oil and gas leasing since 1990, partly in response to the enormous tanker spill in 1989 by the Exxon Valdez.  The Interior Department also announced plans to open a big new area in the central part of the Gulf of Mexico, a move that Congress authorized in December.",

That turned out to be true, but not in the way that Roddick, the 15,000 fans in Rod Laver Arena or even Federer would have imagined.  Instead of an extended duel between Federer, the world's top-ranked player, and Roddick, one of his principal rivals, this hotly anticipated semifinal turned into an 83-minute ode to the brilliance of Federer, and only Federer.  By the end of the second set, it felt much less like a match and much more like a demonstration, as the top-seeded Federer continued to break Roddick's huge serve at will and found new and exciting ways to pass Roddick, who was pushing forward to the net, with rapidly dimming conviction.  It was hardly a surprise that Federer beat the sixth-seeded Roddick. He has won 13 of their 14 matches, including all 5 of their Grand Slam matches, but he has never defeated him with this much ease or this much style on a big occasion. In comparison, Federer's four-set victory against Roddick in last year's United States Open final was a cliffhanger. And when this 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 rout was done, the debate had been resolved on whether Roddick's recent surge and recent exhibition victory against Federer had closed the gap between the players.  ''Look, it's just unreal,'' said Federer, a Swiss, who will face Tommy Haas of Germany or Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez of Chile in Sunday's final. ''I'm shocked myself. I don't know what to say. The tournament is not even over yet. Let's not get carried away. Let me try to do it one more time.''  Roddick, an American, was once more left to explain how it feels to face tennis greatness, and he did it with much more deftness than he demonstrated between the lines: offering mea culpas and compliments and, Roddick still being Roddick, quips. ''It was frustrating, you know it was miserable,'' he said. ''Besides that, it was fine.''  It actually was fine until 4-4 in the opening set. After losing his serve in the opening game of the match, despite putting 5 of 6 first serves into play, Roddick recovered to break Federer back in the fourth game. But with Roddick serving at 4-4, something ineffable clicked in Federer's mind and game. At 30-15, Federer hit a tremendous backhand passing-shot winner. At 30-30, Roddick, just a little edgier, sliced a backhand approach shot into the net, and at 30-40, they both ended up at net, and Federer won the battle of reflexes and touch to complete the break.  Roddick did not know it then, but the match had turned for good. Federer held serve at love to close out the set and proceeded to win 11 games in a row and 24 of 27 points at one particularly lopsided stage.  There were shots from the classic Federer repertory: forehand flicks that dipped just out of Roddick's reach, running one-handed backhand blasts that zipped down the line and sharply cut volleys that hit the rubberized green surface and quickly bounced twice. But there was also some exotica, none more memorable to those who take note (or notes) than the shot produced on the opening point of the fourth game of the second set.  Roddick was behind, 0-3, when Federer gave him a rare short ball. Roddick moved forward and channeled all the frustration of the match's first 40 minutes into a forehand that landed near the baseline. Most players would have gotten out of the way, but Federer sprung to his left and hit a backhand reflex half volley on the move that traveled cross court for a clean winner while Roddick stood gaping at the net as the crowd roared with a mixture of surprise and aesthetic delight.  But such sounds soon gave way to nervous laughter and anticipatory groans as it became clear that Roddick had no answers to the tennis riddles that Federer kept posing. Roddick's frustration eventually gave way to anger, and he could not even get that quite right. He smashed a ball into the stands after losing his serve to fall behind by 0-5. He accidentally lost his grip on the racket in the process, sending it hurtling toward a photographer courtside and earning him a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct.  Even the new electronic line-judging system that Federer dislikes was seeing things Federer's way. He challenged four times and was correct four times. He even managed to transform a missed serve into an ace with a challenge while serving at 2-1, 15-0 in the final set. Roddick, who was convinced the ball had been out, flipped his racket over, stuck the butt against his temple and pretended to pull the trigger.  It was that sort of evening, and it stayed that way as statistical marvels piled up, with Federer converting on all seven of his break points against one of the world's most feared servers and with Federer reaching his seventh consecutive Grand Slam final, tying a record set in 1934 by the Australian Jack Crawford.

Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez gave it all he had, or at least all he had left, in the final Sunday at the Australian Open. With his forehand working and Federer's slightly off target, the Chilean even managed to serve for the opening set.  But despite all the Latin emotion in motion, the coolest head in tennis once again ruled the evening as Federer defended his title in Melbourne and won his 10th Grand Slam singles title with a 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4 victory.  If Federer's opponents hoped that all his success in the past three seasons would leave him feeling sated, his performance here in the year's first Grand Slam event was an unmistakable signal that he remains eager and excellent.  For the first time in his groundbreaking career, Federer swept through a Grand Slam tournament without dropping a set, and the only set points he faced were the two he saved in the first set against Gonz\u00e1lez.  It was a terrific set, full of bold shotmaking and lunging defense with Gonz\u00e1lez's blocks of fans providing plenty of positive reinforcement for their national icon with their chants of ''Chi-Chi-Chi, Le-Le-Le, Chile! Chile!''  Until this tournament, Gonz\u00e1lez had never advanced past the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam event, but with an improved backhand and improved confidence thanks to his new coach, Larry Stefanki, he had broken through by beating four members of the top 20.  Against Tommy Haas in the semifinals, he finished with a stunning 42 winners and just three unforced errors, but a Grand Slam final, particularly against Federer, is a more unnerving proposition. There is the protocol: the photographs at the net beforehand; the aura of gravitas that seeps into the expressions of the officials. It takes time to adjust, and Gonz\u00e1lez did a much better job than most debutants. But he could not maintain the same level of excellence. After just eight points against Federer, Gonz\u00e1lez already had more unforced errors than in the entire match against Haas. But Federer was also not nearly as sharp early as he had been in his semifinal demolition of Andy Roddick.  Windy conditions sometimes cause him trouble, and there were enough gusts mixed in with the blasts from Gonz\u00e1lez to throw him off his rhythm. His deadliest shot is the midcourt forehand, which he can take either direction into the corners, but he failed to convert on several in the early stages of the match. And in the ninth game, Gonz\u00e1lez put together two great backhand passing shots in a row to break Federer's serve and earn the chance to serve for the set at 5-4.  At 40-15, after Federer hit a backhand return wide, it looked the Chilean was going to transform this final into something more compelling than the latest Federer coronation. But on the first set point, Federer pushed forward to the net and Gonz\u00e1lez hit a hasty forehand passing shot straight at him, which the Swiss volleyed away for a winner. On the second set point, Gonz\u00e1lez kicked a first serve to the backhand and was greeted with a deep return. The Chilean responded with an edgy forehand unforced error.  It was deuce, and Federer would soon be back to 5-5, and though Gonz\u00e1lez saved four set points of his own on his serve in the 12th game, he could not dig his teeth into the tiebreaker, falling behind 0-5.  The rest was less suspenseful, as is so often the case with one of the best players and front runners in history.  ''He was the better player in the first set,'' Federer said. ''If he closes it out 6-4, it's clear he's the better player in that set. But I came back just at the right moment. I was missing too many forehands, didn't know what to do with his slice. Maybe the wind, maybe his court coverage put me under pressure. I wasn't feeling that great from the start.''  He looked much more at ease from then on, controlling his serve with ease and breaking Gonz\u00e1lez in the seventh game of both the second and third sets. He would claim the match and his third Australian Open title by holding his serve at love, shrieking with delight after he hit a backhand winner down the line and then rolling onto his back on the green hard court.  The last man to win here without dropping a set was Ken Rosewall in 1971, and Rosewall was in the President's Box in Rod Laver Arena, looking, as usual, fit and neatly coifed.  ''I'm happy to be the guy who follows up on you; it's a great honor,'' Federer said in his postmatch remarks as he gestured toward Rosewall.  It was a telling moment, because Federer for now has much more in common with the game's former luminaries than his current rivals. He is now, just to take one example, 10-0 against Gonz\u00e1lez.  ''I have to congratulate again, again Roger,'' Gonz\u00e1lez said, eliciting laughter from the crowd in his post- match remarks. ''He's a great champion. He played a great match today, the whole week and almost all of his life.''  Pete Sampras leads the list with 14 Grand Slam singles titles; Roy Emerson is next with 12, and Bjorn Borg and Laver each had 11. Bill Tilden, like Federer, has 10. But Federer, still only 25 years old, is moving quickly into range, and Sampras has already said he is convinced that the Swiss will pass him.  His only losses in majors the past two years came at the French Open in 2005 and 2006, with last year's defeat to Rafael Nadal of Spain in the final depriving him of a shot at the Grand Slam. But after this performance, the drums will start beating again as the clay court season and Roland Garros approach.  ''Well, I think last year was really the first year I thought if everything goes perfectly well, there might be a chance,'' Federer said of the Grand Slam. ''And I got so awfully close looking back, but the French Open is the second one. It's such a tough one to win. I've given myself chances the last two years, but Rafa has been so dominant on that surface.''  That is true, but Federer has been dominant on everything else.  AUSTRALIAN OPEN",

            "fulltext": "At least there is history for Roger Federer to play against, because for the moment, no man is much of a match.  Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez gave it all he had, or at least all he had left, in Sunday's final at the Australian Open. With his forehand working and Federer's slightly off target, he even managed to serve for the opening set.  But despite all of Gonz\u00e1lez's emotion in motion, the coolest head in tennis once again ruled the evening as Federer successfully defended his title in Melbourne and won his 10th Grand Slam singles title, 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4.  Federer has won 36 consecutive matches over all, and six of the past seven major titles. No other active player has won more than three Grand Slam titles. Federer is tied for fifth on the career list with Bill Tilden, who won his majors between 1920 and 1930. Pete Sampras is atop the list with 14.  Federer, still only 25, is moving rapidly into range, and Sampras has already said that he is convinced that Federer will pass him, perhaps sooner than later.  Tiger Woods is not yet convinced he will lose his race with Federer. Woods, who met Federer at last year's United States Open, has befriended him. According to Federer, Woods often teases him that he is going to break Jack Nicklaus's career record of 18 Grand Slam golf victories before Federer breaks Sampras's record. Woods is six victories from his target, Federer is four from his.  ''He loves it; he likes to beat me up,'' said Federer, who spoke with Woods while he was in Australia. ''He says he's going to break it first. I hope just to get close to it. He is more, I think, driven than me. I'm maybe more laid-back in terms of looking at all these records and matches, but he really is so driven by the majors and by beating Nicklaus's record.''  He added: ''But I always hope well for Tiger, and not that I'm going to break the record the first. I hope he breaks it as well. I hope we both do.''  If Federer's opponents had hoped that all his success in the past three seasons would leave him feeling sated, his performance here, in the year's first Grand Slam event, was an unmistakable signal that he remains eager and excellent.  For the first time in his groundbreaking career, Federer swept through a Grand Slam tournament without dropping a set, and the only set points he faced were the two he saved in the first set Sunday against Gonz\u00e1lez, of Chile.  It was a terrific set, full of bold shotmaking and lunging defense, with Gonz\u00e1lez's blocs of fans inside and outside Rod Laver Arena providing plenty of positive reinforcement with their chants of ''Chi-Chi-Chi, Le-Le-Le, Chile! Chile!''  Until this tournament, Gonz\u00e1lez had never advanced past the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam event. But with an improved backhand and improved tactics and confidence, thanks to his new coach, Larry Stefanki, he had broken through by beating four members of the top 20.  Against Tommy Haas in the semifinals, he finished with a stunning 42 winners and only 3 unforced errors. A Grand Slam final, however, particularly against Federer, is a more unnerving proposition. There is the protocol: the photographs at the net beforehand, the aura of gravitas that seeps into the expressions of the officials.  It takes time to adjust, and the 10th-seeded Gonz\u00e1lez, who will rise to No. 5 in the world after his run here, did a much better job than most debutantes. But he could not maintain the same level of play against Federer.  ''I wasn't as good as in my other matches, but the guy on the other side of the net also applies more pressure than the guys in my other matches,'' Gonz\u00e1lez said.  After only eight points, Gonz\u00e1lez already had more unforced errors than in the entire match against Haas. But Federer was also not nearly as sharp early as he had been in his semifinal demolition of Andy Roddick.  His signature shot is the midcourt forehand, which he can take either direction into the corners, but he failed to convert on several such shots in the early stages of the match. And in the ninth game, Gonz\u00e1lez put together two great backhand passing shots in a row to break Federer's serve and earn the chance to serve for the set at 5-4.

But on the first set point, Federer pushed forward to the net, and Gonz\u00e1lez hit a hasty forehand passing shot directly at him, which Federer volleyed away for a winner. On the second set point, Gonz\u00e1lez kicked a first serve to the backhand and was greeted with a deep return. He responded with an edgy forehand unforced error.  It was deuce, and Federer would soon be back to 5-5. Though Gonz\u00e1lez saved four set points on his serve in the 12th game, he could not dig his teeth into the tie breaker, falling behind, 0-5, then seeking treatment for a sore right shoulder after losing the set.  The rest was less suspenseful, as is so often the case with one of the best players and front-runners in history.  ''The first set was the set Fernando had to win to have any effect on Roger's psyche, to have any effect on his nervous system,'' Stefanki said.  Federer did indeed look much more at ease after that, controlling his own serve with little difficulty and cutting his unforced errors in half. He claimed the match and his third Australian Open title by holding his serve at love, shouting with delight, then rolling onto his back on the green hardcourt.  The last man to win here without dropping a set was Ken Rosewall in 1971, and Rosewall was in the President's Box on Sunday.  ''I'm happy to be the guy who follows up on you; it's a great honor,'' Federer said in his postmatch remarks as he gestured toward Rosewall.  It was a telling moment, because Federer, at this stage, has much more in common with the game's former luminaries than his current rivals. He is now, for example, 10-0 against Gonz\u00e1lez.  Federer's only loss in the past seven Grand Slam events came at the French Open last year, when Rafael Nadal deprived him of a shot at the Grand Slam by beating him in the final. But after this performance, the drumroll will start again as the clay-court season and Roland Garros approach.  ''Well, I think last year was really the first year I thought if everything goes perfectly well, there might be a chance,'' Federer said of the Grand Slam. ''And I got so awfully close looking back, but the French Open is the second one. It's such a tough one to win. I've given myself chances the last two years, but Rafa has been so dominant on that surface.''  That is true, but Federer has been dominant on everything else, and he has already shown that he is a quick learner and, above all, a great closer.  TENNIS",

            "fulltext": "After two years of waiting and not much playing, Serena Williams is back in a final, and it happens to be in a Grand Slam tournament.  Williams continued the most surprising run of her career Thursday by defeating the 17-year-old Czech Nicole Vaidisova, 7-6 (5), 6-4, in the semifinals of the Australian Open, which she won in 2003 and 2005.  In 2003, Williams was the overwhelming favorite, having won the three previous Grand Slam tournaments. In 2005, she was still on the short list of contenders. This year, she was a true underdog, arriving here with a world ranking of 81, having played in only five tournaments in the last year.  Now, after beating five seeded players, including the 10th-seeded Vaidisova, she has put herself back at the center of the sport and guaranteed herself a place in the top 20.  ''I can't believe it; that's awesome,'' said Williams, whooping it up on court in her postmatch interview. ''That was so fast.''  Speedy indeed, but it took her more time than she would have liked to close out the powerful but erratic Vaidisova, a 6-foot blonde who left Europe to train at Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla., as a youngster, occasionally sneaking peeks at Williams's training sessions there.  Down by 1-5 in the second set, Vaidisova closed the gap to 4-5, saving five match points, before Williams finally closed out the 1-hour, 46-minute victory with a forehand volley winner.  Williams will face the winner of Thursday's second semifinal between top-seeded Maria Sharapova of Russia and No. 4 Kim Clijsters of Belgium, neither of whom has won this title.  As Williams walked through the corridors of Rod Laver Arena, minutes before walking on court, she saw her agent, Jill Smoller, who greeted her by clenching her fists and striking a muscle-beach pose and then giving her a roundhouse smack on the rear.  It was a sign of what makes Williams tick. This surprising run in Melbourne has been much more about desire than thorough preparation, much more about muscle memory and competitiveness than hard-won fitness.  Once on court against Vaidisova, it took time for Williams to bare her teeth. Despite the power being produced on both ends of the court, the pace was slow, almost reflective between the points, and the early games were long.  Vaidisova's game plan was clear early: attack Williams's second serves and try to move her -- not just side to side but back to front with the occasional drop shot. At the start, Vaidisova applied these principles well, breaking Williams's serve in the opening game after two deuces and then holding her own serve to go up, 2-0.  But Williams, who looked sluggish at times early, began moving and serving more convincingly -- she would finish with 10 aces -- and adjusting to Vaidisova's big returns.  Vaidisova, taking huge risks, began to produce more errors than winners with her forehand, with its huge backswing and relatively low margin for error. Williams broke her in the sixth game to get back on serve, but Vaidisova would still get her chance to win the set when she broke Williams again to go up, 5-4, and then served for the lead.  After saving a break point with an ace to get to deuce, she failed to put another first serve into play in the game, as Williams saved a set point with a big forehand that Vaidisova could not handle. It was soon 5-5 and then 6-6, with Williams jumping out to a 5-1 lead in the tie breaker and then holding on to win the set after Vaidisova rallied to 5-5, with Williams serving consecutive double faults at 5-2..  Vaidisova's pride and power in the tie breaker was foreshadowing for the second set when, apparently out of contention, she roared back, saving four match points on her serve at 3-5 and another on Williams's serve at 4-5 before she closed it out.  ''Almost did a gagarooni there,'' Williams said. ''Basically that means gagging. But she played some incredible points on match points, just got relaxed. She reminded me a little bit of myself.''  In late matches on Wednesday, Tommy Haas and Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez took radically different paths to their upset victories.  Haas had to win arguments with himself as well as win rallies, and had to fight through rough patches, swooping pigeons and even a match point before finally closing out Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, the world's third-ranked player, in five sets.  Gonz\u00e1lez, once again, could do little wrong, coming up with clutch serves and huge forehands on points big and small. He also kept the unforced errors that were once his trademarks to a minimum as he overwhelmed Rafael Nadal of Spain, the second-ranked player, in straight sets.  Though their methods and moods were disparate, the 10th-seeded Gonz\u00e1lez and the 12th-seeded Haas share a healthy perspective. They are both middle-aged for tennis stars -- Haas is a 28-year-old German, Gonz\u00e1lez a 26-year-old Chilean -- and both have had to wait their turn for the sort of breakthrough that prodigies like Nadal understandably take for granted.  Now these two flashy players with one-handed backhands will share the spotlight with each other in the semifinals Friday night at Rod Laver Arena. In the other semifinal, top-seeded Roger Federer was to face Andy Roddick on Thursday. Sharapova, seeded No. 1, and Clijsters, seeded fourth, both struggled yet prevailed on Wednesday. Clijsters, who has announced that this will be her last Australian Open, failed to control her power for significant stretches of the first and second sets, finishing with 62 unforced errors and 47 winners against the three-time champion Martina Hingis.  The last time Haas was in the final four of a Grand Slam was here in 2002, the same year he topped out at No. 2 in the rankings, the same year his right shoulder failed him, requiring two surgeries and knocking him out of the game for more than a year and out of contention for the major prizes until now.  Haas was the only man to push Federer to a fifth set in any Grand Slam last year, doing so here in the fourth round. He later lost to Davydenko in five sets in the quarterfinals of the United States Open, paying the toll for the two five-set victories that preceded the match.  He could have gone down swinging again this time if Davydenko had managed to return Haas's kicking second serve on his one and only match point at 4-5, 30-40 in the fifth set. But Davydenko went for too much and missed a backhand into the net.  Haas missed his first chance to close out the match when serving at 6-5, 40-15 when Davydenko successfully challenged a line call on a forehand that had been called out. But Haas converted on his next match point, moving to his left and hitting his signature running backhand down the line. That left the baseline-hugging Davydenko, usually the master of the full-swinging half volley, to lunge and miss as Haas won, 6-3, 2-6, 1-6, 6-1, 7-5.  Gonz\u00e1lez has become a familiar presence in the second week of Grand Slam events, but only early in the second week. He reached the quarterfinals at the 2002 United States Open, the quarterfinals of the 2003 French Open and even the quarterfinals in 2005 at Wimbledon.  But it has taken until now for the huge-hitting, soft-spoken Gonz\u00e1lez to take the next step into the semifinals, and he has done so in great style despite a meaty draw that required him to face Lleyton Hewitt in the third round and the supposedly red-hot James Blake in the fourth. Then came Nadal, the tenacious left-hander.  ''I'm delighted, but it's not over,'' Gonz\u00e1lez said after his 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 victory in which he never lost his serve, finishing with 41 winners, including 10 aces, and just 16 unforced errors.  Nadal has been the best player not named Roger Federer for the last two seasons, but he was not at his best Wednesday, finishing with seven more unforced errors than winners and failing to play the same sort of spectacularly effective defense that, along with his whipping forehand and combativeness, has defined him.  The reasons, according to Nadal, were Gonz\u00e1lez and the aftershocks of his marathon match with Andy Murray in the fourth round: a late-night five-setter that left him feeling soreness in his legs and pain in his upper left leg.  ''It was taking a lot of effort for me to run; I couldn't keep up with the rhythm of the match,'' Nadal said.  TENNIS",

            "fulltext": "The excellent news just kept coming for Lucie Safarova at the Australian Open. No sooner had she stunned herself and second-seeded Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo by winning their fourth-round match, 6-4, 6-3, when she was informed that her boyfriend, Tomas Berdych, had also won his match.  ''Wow! Great,'' she said. ''We're going to have to celebrate.''  Mauresmo was the one celebrating in Melbourne last year, after winning her first Grand Slam singles title 13 years after she turned professional.  But this season is off to a much less auspicious start for Mauresmo, thanks to Safarova, a 19-year-old left-hander from the Czech Republic who generates plenty of racket-head speed with quick cuts at her ground strokes and first serves.  The match was not the only women's upset Sunday. Third-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia, the 2004 United States Open champion, fell to No. 16 Shahar Peer of Israel, 6-4, 6-2. Peer will play the winner of Sunday's late match between 11th-seeded Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and Serena Williams.  Playing her first match at Rod Laver Arena, Safarova served notice that she was a threat by forcing Mauresmo to save two break points in her opening service game. Mauresmo appeared to take the hint, stabilizing her game to take a 4-1 lead, but her lack of depth on her topspin ground strokes soon became a problem. Safarova began finding the corners and pushing forward to the net with success.  Safarova won 18 of the last 21 points of the set, and she soon took a 4-1 lead in the second. But Mauresmo did not go meekly. She broke Safarova's serve in the next game, then held her own after a successful challenge of a serve that had been called out. The momentum was shifting, and it was soon 4-3 -- often a cue for the inexperienced player on the verge of a major upset to begin overthinking and overhitting.  But Safarova held firm to hold serve, then held even firmer in the final game of the match, recovering from the disappointment of failing to convert her first two match points on Mauresmo's serve. The last point was a microcosm of the match as Safarova nailed a short forehand into Mauresmo's backhand corner and followed it into the net, getting a passing shot into the net as a reward.  ''It's amazing; I still can't believe it,'' Safarova said. ''Warming up in the morning, I was saying like, wow, this a big court. But I felt really comfortable here.''  Until this tournament, Safarova's record in Grand Slam tournaments was 1-5, but her comprehensive 6-3, 6-3 victory against the combative Italian Francesca Schiavone, seeded 14th, in the second round was a sign of major progress. And now she is into the quarterfinals, where she will face No. 10 Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic, who defeated seventh-seeded Elena Dementieva of Russia, 6-3, 6-3.  After six days of difficult weather, Sunday's conditions were blustery but relatively cool and sunny. There was no play at all on the outside courts on Saturday because of rain, a challenge for the organizers.  Eighth-seeded David Nalbandian of Argentina saved three match points before beating S\u00e9bastien Grosjean of France in five sets Saturday. Nalbandian will face Tommy Haas, who defeated his fellow German Florian Mayer in straight sets Sunday.  The huge-hitting Berdych, Safarova's boyfriend of four years, also had to wait a day before facing Dmitry Tursunov, but he should not be too leg weary when he plays No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko on Monday. Berdych, seeded 13th, needed little more than an hour to eliminate the ailing Tursunov of Russia, 6-2, 6-1, 6-1.  Li Na of China, seeded 19th, advanced quickly Sunday, defeating ninth-seeded Dinara Safina of Russia, 6-2, 6-2. Li has reached the fourth round or better in three consecutive Grand Slam events, and she could pose a serious threat to her next opponent, Martina Hingis.  Patty Schnyder will face the rising Russian Anna Chakvetadze, who defeated Jelena Kostanic Tosic, 6-4, 6-4. Kim Clijsters will face Daniela Hantuchova of the Slovak Republic, who survived a threat from the unseeded American Ashley Harkleroad. Down by a set and by 0-4 in the second, Hantuchova went on to win, 6-7 (6), 7-5, 6-3, leaving Harkleroad sobbing into her towel in her chair on Show Court Three.  TENNIS",

            "fulltext": "The champion on the way out beat the champion on the way back, and now Kim Clijsters will face Maria Sharapova in the semifinals of the Australian Open.  Clijsters, who has said that this will be her final Australian Open, struggled mightily to control her power for stretches of the first and second sets against the three-time champion Martina Hingis. But in the end, Clijsters's weight of shot and Hingis's lightweight second serve made the difference, as Clijsters broke open a tight match by sweeping the final four games to win, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.  ''This could have been my last one here; I'm glad I get to play another one,'' said the fourth-seeded Clijsters, who plans to retire from competitive tennis at the end of this season despite being only 23 years old.  Clijsters holds a 4-2 edge over the top-seeded Sharapova, but she lost both of their matches last year in straight sets on hard courts. Neither woman was near her best on this gorgeous, sometimes windy afternoon. Clijsters finished with 62 unforced errors to 47 winners against Hingis, who returned to the sport last year after a three-year break from the game.  As the flubbed returns and double faults piled up for Sharapova against Anna Chakvetadze, Sharapova's coaches, Yuri Sharapov and Michael Joyce, were visibly suffering in the front row.  Sharapov's gesticulations resulted in a warning for illegal coaching midway through the second set as his daughter served at 3-3, 0-30. Sharapov kept his arms folded across his chest for much of the uneven tennis that remained.  Sharapova's 7-6 (5), 7-5 victory required 2 hours 14 minutes -- 11 minutes more than Clijsters's three-set victory -- as the 12th-seeded Chakvetadze kept alternating the sublime (her two-handed backhand) and the ridiculous (a second serve that bounced well before hitting the net in the final set).  ''Sometimes I feel I don't know if she knows what she's doing,'' Sharapova said. ''She definitely has a lot of variety. If she wants to step in, she has a lot of power behind her strokes. But over all, at the end of the day, it's just about who took the chances a little more.''  That has been Sharapova's trademark throughout her career, and it does indeed take preternatural self-confidence to keep taking huge cuts at returns when the results have generally been unsatisfactory.  ''She is stronger,'' said Chakvetadze, a fast-rising blond Muscovite who, at 19, is the same age as Sharapova. ''She's a great fighter. I think she deserves this win.''  But even Sharapova conceded that she will probably have to raise her level if she is to break through to her first Australian Open final. She has come close the last two years, losing to Serena Williams in the 2005 semifinals despite holding three match points and then losing to Justine Henin-Hardenne last year in the same round in a three-set match.  Both Williams and Henin-Hardenne went on to win the title. Williams is still in contention here despite being unseeded. She will face Nicole Vaidisova, a 17-year-old Czech, in Thursday's semifinal in the bottom half of the draw.  Henin-Hardenne withdrew from the tournament for personal reasons. On Wednesday, a posting on her Web site confirmed that she and her husband of five years, Pierre-Yves Hardenne, were separating.  ''These last weeks have not been easy for me or my entourage,'' she wrote. The Web site's name has already been changed from heninhardenne.be to justine-henin.be.  It has been an unusual tournament from the start for Sharapova, who was two points from defeat against the underpowered Camille Pin of France in the first round as temperatures soared well above 100 degrees on court and left Sharapova sluggish and disoriented. Even without being in top form, she has recovered well enough not to drop another set.  Yet she needed more than two hours to beat Vera Zvonareva, 7-5, 6-4, in a night match on Monday in the fourth round. Both Zvonareva and Chakvetadze play terrific defense and are capable of handling Sharapova's power from the baseline.  ''You know, it's tough to be aggressive because Maria, she's hitting the ball so hard,'' Chakvetadze said. ''Especially in the warm-up, I thought she would kill me.''  But once the rallies began in earnest, Chakvetadze held her own. When Sharapova double-faulted to lose her serve and fall behind, 2-4, it appeared that Chakvetadze might do more than that.  But Chakvetadze responded to success by double-faulting herself to lose her serve in the next game, only to have Sharapova do the same again to lose hers.  So it went into the tie breaker, with neither player winning a point on serve until Sharapova managed it at 4-4. On the next point, Chakvetadze glided forward to hit a short forehand and guided it wide.  The set would soon be over, and Chakvetadze's forehand would prove to be vulnerable shot throughout the rest of the match. It did not help her cause that she waited until after the first set to receive treatment for a strained right shoulder.  ''I definitely should have called the trainer earlier,'' she said.  Sharapova received treatment on court for a blister on her left foot in the second set after taking a 4-3 lead in the game in which she received the coaching warning. Sharapov gestured as if he were hitting a forehand from the stands as she fell behind in the game.  The coaching issue is a sensitive one with Sharapova. ''I asked the umpire if it was in between those two points, because between those two points, I didn't see anything or even look at him,'' she said.  Sharapov was not the only father/coach in an agitated mood on Wednesday. Chakvetadze's father/coach, Djambuli, also did little to disguise his mood swings in a different section of the stands.  ''It's normal,'' Sharapova said. ''I've been with my dad every single day, and I'm sure Anna has, as well. They're both animated. Both want you to win, and they're really excited for the opportunities you have.''  TENNIS",

            "fulltext": "It has been two weeks of turning back the clock for Serena Williams, and under a closed roof during Saturday's Australian Open women's final, she completed her astoundingly quick trip back to dominance against the top-seeded Maria Sharapova.  Under the lights, she was the relentless Williams of yore: crushing returns and first serves, casting ominous glances across the net and showing not the slightest hint of vulnerability as she raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory.  The rout, which required just one hour and three minutes, capped one of the most remarkable comebacks in tennis history, and it came against the young, confident woman who will regain the No. 1 ranking on Monday.  But there could be no doubt about who was No. 1 Saturday, as Williams applied enormous pressure from the start and methodically extracted all the suspense to win her eighth Grand Slam singles title and third Australian Open title.  She also won here in 2003 and 2005, and that victory in 2005 was her last in any tournament until this year's unexpected run through a brutal draw in Melbourne. Although Williams arrived here unseeded and ranked 81st, she eliminated six seeded players in her seven matches.  But Williams, the first unseeded woman to win here since the Australian Chris O'Neil in 1978, saved the most prestigious victim for last. When it was over, Williams was jumping up and down with delight, reaching up into the stands to slap hands with her mother and coach, Oracene Price, and eventually dancing in front of her chair. Meanwhile, Sharapova was sitting in hers with tears streaming down her cheeks.  ''You can never underestimate her as an opponent, and I don't think many of you expected her to be in the final, but I definitely did,'' Sharapova said to the crowd in Rod Laver Arena. ''I know what she's capable of. She showed it today. She's an amazing champion, and she showed it here many times, and of course I look forward to playing her many more times, and winning a few, I hope.''  Williams soon began to cry herself when she concluded her rambling, merry victory speech on a serious note as she spoke of her slain half sister, Yetunde Price, who was murdered in September 2003 in Compton, Calif. ''Most of all I would like to dedicate this victory to my sister who is not here,'' Williams told the crowd. ''Her name is Yetunde, and I just love her so much.''  It was a remarkably forceful and focused afternoon for Williams against Sharapova, the 19-year-old who has supplanted her as the sport's dominant personality and commercial enterprise.  Williams finished with 28 winners and 11 unforced errors, a huge success rate for someone who takes such risks with her aggressive game. She broke Sharapova's shaky serve four times and never lost her own, serving seven aces and putting 67 percent of her first serves into play.  ''On the scoreboard, it definitely looked easy, but I was just fighting for every point,'' Williams said in an interview with Australian television.  As the vagaries of Melbourne's weather would have it, Williams has won all three of her titles here indoors. In 2003, the roof was closed because of extreme heat when she beat her sister Venus in three sets to conclude her self-styled ''Serena Slam'' by winning her fourth consecutive Grand Slam singles title. It was closed because of rain in 2005 when she beat Lindsay Davenport after another surprising run through the draw when she, by her own admission, was not in top shape. This year, there were scattered showers in the hour before the match was scheduled to begin, which caused organizers to close the roof again, putting Williams back in a familiar place and frame of mind.  ''When I saw the roof was closed, I said, 'I'm going to win for sure,' '' Williams said with a laugh.  Sharapova became a star by surprising Williams in the 2004 Wimbledon final, handling her power on the grass of the All England Club with baseline power of her own. But Williams had won their most recent match, saving three match points in the 2005 Australian Open semifinals, on her way to the title.  Since then, Williams has struggled with knee problems and personal problems, fighting through depression and distractions and slipping out of the top 100 at one stage last year. All the while, Sharapova was growing into her game and producing consistent excellence in the Grand Slam events, hitting a peak by winning her second major title at last year's United States Open, where Williams was knocked out in the fourth round by Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo.  There were few hints in recent months that Williams was ready for a breakthrough. She did not play another tournament after the U.S. Open last season, and when she did return to the circuit this month to play a warm-up event in Tasmania, she was beaten in the quarterfinals by a player of limited means: Sybille Bammer of Austria.  Price said the defeat in Tasmania left her daughter in a particularly foul mood. Clearly, Williams still cared, and the matches played there, however uneven, proved useful to her in Melbourne, as she started from a higher platform and made the leap into top form.  ''I think I get the greatest satisfaction just of holding up the Grand Slam trophy and proving everyone wrong; I just love that,'' Williams said. ''I just had so much fun out there today. I just made some great shots. It was just fun.''  This title run did not come without suspense. Williams was down a set and 3-5 in the third round against the fifth-seeded Nadia Petrova before finding her range and roaring back to win. She was also two points from defeat against Shahar Peer of Israel in the quarterfinals, but Williams has played the big points bravely, sometimes ferociously.  Her power and her past still intimidate, even against Sharapova, another fierce competitor who, like Williams, was raised to be a champion, but did not have an older sister along to share the ride and the sacrifices.  But Williams came here without Venus, who withdrew from this tournament, citing continuing problems with an injury to her left wrist. Now, at least one of the Williams sisters is back at the forefront of the sport.  Serena will rise to No. 14 in the rankings on Monday, and she intends to play a relatively full schedule at least through Wimbledon after playing only four tournaments last year.  ''I've been working really hard the last year,'' Williams said, ''and I haven't felt my results have been showing, and finally it all came together at the Australian Open.''  TENNIS",

            "fulltext": "MELBOURNE -- Roger Federer was sitting comfortably, legs crossed, after vanquishing Tommy Robredo in less style than usual in the quarter final round of the Australian Open Tuesday. He was talking just a little wistfully about how great it had been to watch a five-set match the night before when Rafael Nadal's staying power had gotten the better of Andy Murray's brain power.  \"Very interesting, I thought,\" said Federer, who had stayed up late on Monday night to see the finish on television in his hotel room. \"Raf is incredibly tough. I like to watch him just battle it out. I love seeing that. I mean he was so strong in the end. He deserved to win.\"  For the moment in Melbourne, the small screen is as close as Federer is getting to five-set fever. Despite fluctuations in form and weather conditions, the world's number one player has not come close to going the distance at this Australian Open.  In five matches, he has not lost a set, and even losing his serve four times, as he did against the seventh-seeded Robredo on a cool, gusty Tuesday night that played tricks with timing, was not enough to keep Federer from closing out the smooth-moving Spanish baseliner 6-3, 7-6 (2), 7-5.  \"I think he has a level of confidence that is way up there,\" said Robredo, who has lost all seven of his matches against Federer. \"He comes up with what he needs.\"  Federer has set the bar so high that even straight-set victories can seem deflating if they contain a few too many errant shots or a few too many groans of frustration.  But the ongoing test of a great champion is how his game responds to true pressure, and though Federer has played and won two tiebreakers in Melbourne, it appears that Roddick's form and the American's state of mind could make things more interesting for Federer when the two face off for the 14th time on Thursday night.  \"I look forward to it,\" Roddick said. \"We've done it before. I'm sure we'll do it again. I feel like I'm in good form. I'd love to see where I match up.\"  After having to fight his way past former Australian Open champion Marat Safin in the third round in four sets and Mario Ancic in the next round in five sets, Roddick got to conserve some energy on Tuesday as he put close friendship aside for an hour and 27 minutes and overwhelmed his former housemate Mardy Fish 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 and then kept the celebration to a minimum  \"You know, it's always difficult; it's a weird, weird situation,\" said Roddick, who made a minuscule four unforced errors in the match. \"Being that we're close, I think it takes away maybe a little of the elation because you're not really solely focused on your side of the court. Maybe you're a little more conscious of both sides. It wasn't a planned reaction not to do anything. It was just kind of what I felt.\"  A victory over Federer would leave him with no reason to hold back. Theirs, for now, is much more a relationship than a rivalry. Federer has won 12 of their 13 matches, his only loss coming in 2003 in the semifinals of the Masters Series event in Canada when Federer was one victory away from claiming the number one ranking for the first time.  \"It was so important for me this experience, this kind of pressure, because never in my life had I handled pressure like this,\" said Federer, who lost in a third-set tiebreaker. \"So I was so disappointed but so happy to have gone through it later on.\"  By the end of the 2003 season, Roddick had the number one ranking but Federer had begun taking control of the sport, and he has maintained that control for three full seasons, clamping down hard on Roddick in a series of matches in late 2004 and 2005.  But after successfully recruiting all-time great Jimmy Connors to help coach him, Roddick has made changes to his backhand and tactics and, above all, recovered his sense of the possible.  \"I'll be the first to say it was a welcomed change, almost a new life,\" Roddick said. \"Just the way he put things, it just clicked. I don't know if you can minimize the effect that he's had on me.\"  With Connors in his corner, Roddick took a set off Federer in last year's United States Open final before losing his edge in the fourth. More encouragingly, he held three match points against the Swiss in a round-robin match at the Masters Cup in Shanghai in November before losing, and then beat him in the final of an exhibition tournament in Melbourne before the Australian Open.  Federer looked anything but devastated, which was understandable. An exhibition is just that, but it could not have hurt Roddick's confidence to get another taste of what it felt like to beat the Swiss.  \"Anytime you can get over the hump at all I think it helps you,\" said John Roddick, who remains his brother's co-coach. \"You're definitely not going to blow it out of proportion, but definitely, you kind of tuck it away in the back of your head and know you can do it.\"",

            "fulltext": "Few would have imagined, perhaps not even Serena Williams, that when the second week of the Australian Open began, she would still be in contention for the title and the defending champion Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo would not.  But Williams, in the latest surprising twist in her fiction-trumping life, has quickly gathered momentum and belief after beating two of the better players in the world: fifth-seeded Nadia Petrova of Russia and 11th-seeded Jelena Jankovic of Serbia. Even members of Williams's entourage were shaking their heads in disbelief Sunday night after she had played a fine match from start to finish to beat Jankovic, 6-3, 6-2.  ''I kept hearing she's not in shape,'' Jankovic said. ''But she was running corner to corner and hitting great shots. It just shows that with her, you never know what to expect. You never know.  ''If she plays like she did today, she can maybe even win it.''  That would really be a plot twist, considering how little tennis Williams has played in the past five months, but her draw, so daunting early, is no longer brimming with heavyweights. Nobody else left in her half has been to a Grand Slam final.  ''I like being a dangerous floater,'' said Williams, who arrived here ranked 81st and has guaranteed herself a spot in the top 50 by reaching the quarterfinals.  Her opponent will be 16th-seeded Shahar Peer, the first Israeli to reach this stage in a major tournament. Peer, a determined 19-year-old counterpuncher now being coached part time by Jos\u00e9 Higueras, upset third-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, 6-4, 6-2, after saving two match points against Tatiana Golovin in the third round.  Williams won their only previous match in straight sets, but that was in 2005, before Peer truly took flight. ''She's young and agile and fit, so I have to really be ready,'' Williams said.  The other quarterfinal in her half of the draw will be an all-Czech, all-teenager affair between 10th-seeded Nicole Vaidisova and unseeded Lucie Safarova, a left-hander, who upset Mauresmo, 6-4, 6-3, in the fourth round. In the other half, Martina Hingis advanced to the quarterfinals by beating Li Na of China, 4-6, 6-3, 6-0. She will face Kim Clijsters, who defeated Daniela Hantuchova, 6-1, 7-5.  On Friday, Williams was on the verge of elimination against Petrova. But trailing by one set and 3-5 in the second, she suddenly found her range and stormed back to a three-set victory. Against Jankovic, it was as if Williams was still riding the wave, and this time she was impressive from start to finish.  Jankovic, long ponytail flapping, had beaten Williams in their past two meetings and had had a great deal more success of late. Williams has not reached a final since the 2005 Australian Open. Jankovic reached the United States Open semifinals last year and started this season by winning in Auckland, New Zealand, and coming close to beating Clijsters in the final in Sydney, Australia.  ''She knew that if she didn't come out strong, I'd get on top of her, because I have two wins over her,'' Jankovic said. ''But she did come out strong, and I was feeling a little tired, a little flat.''  Williams took a 3-0 lead before rain forced them briefly off court. When they resumed under a closed roof, Jankovic lifted her play and won the next two games. But Williams, despite the occasional unforced error, did consistent damage on Jankovic's serve, which is the weakest part of her game. Williams broke Jankovic four times and held her own serve all but once, generating the sort of controlled power that no other woman in the game can manage.  ''It's scary,'' Jankovic said. ''When I was looking at the clock, I was seeing 200 kilometers per hour, and I was thinking what would happen if it came too close to my body, and I couldn't get out of the way and it hit me in the stomach. Would it go through me?''  Williams clearly still has the power to intimidate, but the most impressive part of her game Sunday was her ability to hold her own and more in the extended baseline rallies. She is carrying extra weight but still covering the court quite well.  ''I have it in me,'' said Williams, who has not beaten two players of this caliber back to back since she won here in 2005. ''I believe in my game and more than anything I believe in me. It doesn't matter what people say or people write. At the end of the day, I'm my biggest fan. Maybe my dad. But other than that, you have to always be your biggest fan. I'm just working on staying positive.''  Meanwhile, the future of men's tennis and the present of men's tennis remain just that after they exchanged serves and returns Sunday. For all his obvious talent, 19-year-old Novak Djokovic could not take so much as a set from Roger Federer in the fourth round.  Switched on from the start, Federer swooped from baseline to net and back again, thwarting all that big-hitting, two-handed ambition on the other side of the court with his trademark blend of power and finesse to win, 6-2, 7-5, 6-3.  Next up in the quarterfinals for Federer: Tommy Robredo, seeded seventh, a high-energy Spaniard whom Federer has beaten six times in six previous matches.  It has been that sort of tournament thus far for the defending champion Federer, who despite nursing a mild cold has yet to lose a set and yet to become entangled in the traps that this tournament can spring.  While Maria Sharapova, the top-seeded woman, had to find a way to win despite self-described delirium Tuesday as she played in brutally hot conditions, Federer was relaxing on his day off. He did not have to bother with the blustery conditions Sunday because he played Djokovic under a roof because of intermittent drizzle.  Federer's primary rival in the top half of the draw, the American Andy Roddick, has had to slug his way through a rough section: beating the former Australian Open champion Marat Safin in four intense sets Friday, then requiring five more to get past ninth-seeded Mario Ancic on Sunday.  Not that the Australian fans are complaining. They have once again come to Melbourne Park in record numbers despite the opening-day riot between Serbian and Croatian fans, and Roddick's matches have provided some of the best entertainment. He will now provide the tournament with another fine story line in the quarterfinals, in which he faces his childhood friend and former housemate Mardy Fish, the only unseeded man left in the tournament.  But that is not quite as big a surprise as Williams. ''You guys keep burying her, and she keeps coming back to life,'' Mauresmo said as she prepared to head back to France.  TENNIS",

            "fulltext": "The first man into the quarterfinals of this year's Australian Open on Sunday was unseeded Mardy Fish, which was quite an achievement considering the former state of his forehand and his left wrist.  But Fish, long considered a talented yet unreliable player, has managed to recover from both those handicaps in the last two years with the help of two operations on his wrist and of his coaches Scott Humphries and Todd Martin, each a former Tour player.  Now Fish, 25, is in the final eight at a Grand Slam event for the first time, and, as the luck of the draw would have it, the man he will face is his childhood housemate Andy Roddick.  ''We were more like brothers than best friends,'' Fish said of the years he spent living with the Roddick family in Florida when he and Roddick were aspiring juniors.  Fish advanced Sunday with a 6-1, 7-6 (4), 2-6, 7-5 victory over 16th-seeded David Ferrer of Spain, who had beaten Fish in their two previous matches. Roddick advanced with another impressive performance under heavy pressure, winning by 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 5-7, 6-4 against the net-rushing Mario Ancic of Croatia.  ''I knew in the fifth set, win or lose, I had to try to turn the tables on the aggression,'' said Roddick, who broke the ninth-seeded Ancic in the fifth game of the final set, then held that advantage, serving out the match in style and winning it with a backhand winner down the line.  That shot was a symbol of Roddick's revival in the last six months with the help of his new coach, Jimmy Connors, whose two-handed backhand was his signature shot. Connors was in the front row of Rod Laver Arena on Sunday, pounding on the wall as the sixth-seeded Roddick again came up with the clutch shots he required, just as he had in his third-round bout with the former Australian Open champion Marat Safin.  A year ago, in the fourth round on this same court, Roddick, erratic and confused, was upset by Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in four sets. This year, despite Ancic's constant pressure, Roddick passed the test and is now a heavy favorite to reach the semifinals in light of his current form and a 4-1 record against Fish.  ''It's always a little weird when we play each other because of our history,'' Roddick said.  In the fourth round, the Scottish teenager Andy Murray will have his dream matchup at the Australian Open, but it is not so certain that James Blake has his. Murray had been eagerly awaiting his first chance to match his fluid and fast-maturing all-court game against the slashing forehand and athleticism of Rafael Nadal, the leader of Murray's generation.  Murray granted his own wish by winning in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, against Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina on Saturday. Chela overwhelmed Murray in the first round here last year.  But there will be no novelty for Blake when he faces Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez of Chile in the fourth round. They have played six times, and Gonz\u00e1lez has won the past three matches, all on quick surfaces.  ''He's given me problems the last few times, but I've had some success against him earlier in his career,'' Blake said. ''Hopefully, I can draw on that and get back to the winning ways against him. He's playing pretty confident right now as well.''  On Saturday, against his close friend Robby Ginepri, Blake had to save a set point in the first set, then saved four more set points in the second with Ginepri serving at 5-4. What will look like a straightforward 7-6 (7), 7-5, 6-2 victory on the draw sheet was hardly that.  Ginepri spent time around more than your average weekend hacker in the off-season, playing the latest of a series of exhibition matches against the retired Pete Sampras. ''He taught me a thing or two,'' said Ginepri, who added that Sampras had been thinking about playing one more Wimbledon.  ''There's been some talk about it, but you never know with that,'' Ginepri said. ''He left the sport in a magical way, so he wouldn't want to ruin that.''  TENNIS",

            "fulltext": "Shahar Peer did not make it easy, tracking down big shots that others might not have bothered to chase and rallying from a 4-1 deficit in the third set. Serena Williams did not make it easy on herself, struggling with her movement and timing and never looking entirely comfortable.  But in the end, Williams's remarkable Australian Open continued Tuesday with a 3-6, 6-2, 8-6 victory against the determined, fleet-footed Peer, an Israeli, putting her back in the semifinals of the year's first Grand Slam tennis event.  Williams, who won this tournament in 2003 and 2005, will face the 10th-seeded Nicole Vaidisova, a powerful, temperamental 17-year-old who advanced by defeating the 19-year-old Lucie Safarova, 6-1, 6-4, in their all-Czech quarterfinal.  Vaidisova, whose talent was spotted and nurtured early by the International Management Group, has long been considered tennis's next big thing and promoted accordingly. But she began living up to the hype at last year's French Open, where she reached the semifinals after defeating the top-seeded Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo and Williams's sister Venus.  Now Vaidisova, a tall blonde who was born in Germany, grew up in the Czech Republic and trained in Florida, will have the chance to face another Williams for the first time. She has been watching Serena Williams from close range since Vaidisova was a 12-year-old at Nick Bollettieri's academy.  ''I was definitely a big fan of hers, admired the way she played,'' Vaidisova said.  There has not been much playing to admire in the past two years; Williams has kept her matches and victories to a minimum. She has not reached a final since winning here in 2005. This is only her second event since September, and she arrived in Melbourne ranked 81st amid considerable skepticism about her fitness and commitment. She had a lengthy off-season, which was disrupted by an emotional trial; she and her father, Richard, were involved in a breach-of-contract lawsuit.  But Williams, despite a nagging cold, is now two victories from a third Australian Open title. She has already guaranteed herself a spot in the top 30 in next week's rankings. Although Vaidisova should be the fresher player, that was also true of Williams's four previous seeded victims here: No 27 Mara Santangelo, No. 5 Nadia Petrova, No. 11 Jelena Jankovic and now the 16th-seeded Peer.  ''I'm just happy to be out here and competing,'' Williams said in her on-court remarks to the crowd at Rod Laver Arena, punctuating her sentences with big sips from her water bottle. ''I'm just so excited. Yet another seed!''  This was not nearly the same level of performance as her victory against Jankovic in the fourth round. Williams had 49 unforced errors to 30 winners and put less than 60 percent of her first serves in play against Peer. But she maintained her good habits of serving well under duress and attacking the net effectively.  ''I was just feeling bad for her because she was so flat,'' said her mother and coach, Oracene Price, of the match's early stages. ''And she was getting down on herself. She didn't understand why she wasn't playing better.''  After Peer had clawed back to 4-4 in the third, Williams fell behind, 15-40, on her serve but got back to deuce with consecutive aces. She later saved another in that game with a first serve that Peer could not handle. At 5-5, Williams was down another break point and saved it with a huge first serve and swinging forehand volley that landed on the line.  But Peer, 19, the first Israeli woman to reach this stage of a Grand Slam tournament, held firm on her own serve until the 13th game. Then, at 30-30, Williams nailed a backhand passing shot crosscourt that Peer volleyed long. Peer then missed a backhand on the next point, allowing Williams to serve out the match.  ''She's not quite there and still kicking butt,'' said Price, who expressed pride and mild surprise at her daughter's performance here. She added: ''She's enjoying the competition and really wants to get back. Hopefully now she can stay halfway healthy.''  While the women played in the warmth of the Australian summer on Tuesday, the temperature was much different a few hours earlier when the second-seeded Rafael Nadal finally managed to shake free of Andy Murray, a 19-year-old from Scotland, in the most compelling match of the men's tournament.  For close to four hours in the fourth round, the 15th-seeded Murray and Nadal gave the few thousands fans left in the stands at Rod Laver Arena much more than their money's worth. They turned terrific shots and lunging gets into the coin of their realm as they tested the limits of each other's abilities. When this first match between them had finally ended, Nadal was a 6-7 (3), 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 winner, and the prevailing sentiment was that it had better not be their last meeting.  If this is what the next generation has in store, then tennis is in good hands. For now, Nadal, a left-hander from Spain, has the advantage in terms of achievement, and physical and mental strength.  Nadal, 20, has won the past two French Open titles and 15 other tournaments. He has clearly established himself as the world's second-best player behind Roger Federer, whom Nadal happens to have beaten six times in nine matches.  If Nadal had not saved all 10 break points he faced in the final two sets, the match could have been very different.  ''I think this will be one of those matches I'll remember the most,'' said Nadal, who will face the 10th-seeded Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez of Chile in the first Australian Open quarterfinal for both.  Gonz\u00e1lez eliminated the fifth-seeded James Blake on Monday, 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (4). Their fourth-round match could have been more compelling if Blake had not failed to convert on three set points in the opening set with Gonz\u00e1lez serving at 4-5, 0-40.  Blake, who swept to a title in Sydney this month and appeared in rare form here in the early rounds, also led by 4-2, 40-0 on his serve in the second set. But Gonz\u00e1lez caught him from behind again, defeating Blake for a fourth consecutive time.  ''I think that James got a little too angry,'' said Patrick McEnroe, the United States Davis Cup captain. ''He doesn't play well when he gets negative. He plays better when he has fun and he's applauding the other guy's shots. I think he maybe felt the pressure a little bit. He also played a guy as hot as he was.''  The top-seeded player in the women's draw, Maria Sharapova, has recovered well after nearly staggering out of the tournament in 110-degree heat in the first round. On Monday night, she had her troubles but defeated a tricky and resurgent Vera Zvonareva of Russia, 7-5, 6-4.  Sharapova is back in the quarterfinals, where she will face the 12th-seeded Anna Chakvetadze.  TENNIS",

After struggling to sustain an extended rally in the opening set against the fifth-seeded Nadia Petrova of Russia, after falling behind by 3-5 in the second, Williams summoned the controlled power and belief of Grand Slams past with some help from an edgy Petrova and roared back to win, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3.  It was as if you could see the rust dissolving, as Williams, who has played only two tournaments in the past five months, found her feet and her range on the court where she won the Australian Open in 2003 and 2005.  ''I wasn't surprised,'' Williams said. ''I think if you put your mind to it, you can do anything. I was just out there and playing my game. Like I always said, if I play my game and play the way I know I can, then it's tough to beat me.''  She is now back in the fourth round, where she will face 11th-seeded Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, a 6-3, 6-4 winner over Victoria Azarenka of Belarus.  Once the world's dominant and most intimidating player, Williams has slumped to 81st in the rankings and was knocked out of a warmup event in Hobart, Tasmania this month by the undistinguished Austrian Sybille Bammer in the quarterfinals.  But Williams, even overweight and very short on matches after an emotional off-season, can still generate world-class pace with her serve and groundstrokes. The surprise, for anyone who saw her spraying forehands and breathing hard between points in the early going, was that she was able to control that power and cover the court effectively in the final hour of the match against one of the world's top players.  ''Well, I really had no other option than for my game to go up,'' Williams said. ''I was down, 3-5, and on the verge of being out of the tournament, and I obviously didn't want that to happen. I felt like I was playing well. I felt like I just wasn't making my shots or just barely missing them. I told myself just to stay in there, and it would come together, sooner hopefully than later.''  The defending women's champion, Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, also advanced to the fourth round on Friday with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Eva Birnerova. Third-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated Maria Kirilenko, 6-1, 6-4.  On Thursday, the unseeded American Ashley Harkleroad surprised No. 17 Anna-Lena Groenefeld of Germany, 6-2, 6-2, to reach the third round. Another American, Robby Ginepri, earned a third-round match with his good friend James Blake by defeating the German qualifier Mischa Zverev in straight sets. Rafael Nadal of Spain had to hustle and improvise until 1:30 a.m. before winning, 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, against the German Philipp Kohlschreiber, who hardly looked intimidated against the world's No. 2 player, nailing two short passing shots straight at Nadal's head.  Petrova, who has won only one of her seven matches against Williams, was hardly deferential to the Williams sisters on the eve of her match, telling Foxsports.com that the good players no longer feared them and that, ''It looks like everything is leading to the end of their career because they are quite busy; they have talks shows, books, and clothing lines.''  But it is Williams who will be busier with tennis here now. Playing in cool conditions under a closed roof in Rod Laver Arena helped her cause (it was raining outside), but Williams also helped herself with aggressive returning and effective serving. After putting 53 percent of her first serves in play in the opening set, which she lost in just 29 minutes, she was over 60 percent the rest of the way and finished with 11 aces, three in her final two service games.  ''They've always been tough competitors, her and her sister,'' said Petrova, striking a radically different post-match tone. ''I also find that they usually have a bit of a struggle in the first rounds against average players. Whenever they have to play a tough opponent, they are raising their game, and they feel a bit more free and are going for the shots.''  Those who believe Williams no longer cares about tennis, with all her outside interests and questionable practice habits, should review video of the final two sets as she flexed her biceps, growled as she chased down drop shots and shrieked with delight that looked more like release. One can only imagine how well she might cover the court if she could return to her ideal playing weight.  ''I'm definitely getting closer,'' Williams said. ''I feel like there's some more balls that I would like to get, but I feel like I'm definitely moving a lot better. My legs are feeling a lot better, so I'm not worried.''  It has been a long time since Williams, the perennial favorite, pulled off an upset, but this victory qualifies, even if she held a 5-1 career edge on Petrova coming into the match. Williams had not beaten a top 10 player since beating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 final here. ''Has it been that long?'' Williams said. ''That's a terrible stat. My God.''  Petrova won five tournaments in 2006, rising as high as No. 3 in the rankings, as Williams made a part-time return to the Tour after health and motivational problems. But the powerful, cosmopolitan Russian, who spent part of her childhood in Egypt, had an inconsistent season in Grand Slam events, with her best result coming with a run to the quarterfinals here.  A fluid athlete with a technically sound serve and an all-court game, Petrova remains emotionally volatile, as she underscored by failing to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set and then double faulting to lose her serve and the set.  She had rallied from a 0-3 deficit to reel off five straight games before Williams recovered. Williams maintained her high level in the mood-swinging final set, in which the players exchanged early breaks of serve before Williams took control of the match with Petrova serving at 2-3.  At deuce, Petrova pushed forward and hit a weak approach shot that Williams pounded for a backhand winner, leaving Petrova pounding the side of her head with her racket strings. On break point, Williams hit another backhand passing shot winner off a much more convincing shot, then celebrated by leaning back from the waist, screaming, with her right fist clenched and neck muscles bulging.  ''Stay focused, stay focused,'' Williams said to herself in the next game, and she did, finishing off her post-match fete by saying, ''Hi Dad! Call me!'' into the camera to her father, Richard Williams.  ''I haven't been able to reach him for a few days,'' Williams said later. ''I know he's watching.''  TENNIS",

Mr. DiCaprio was nominated in the lead-actor category for his performance in ''Blood Diamond'' and for his supporting role in ''The Departed.'' Ms. Mirren, right, was nominated for her depiction of Queen Elizabeth II in ''The Queen'' and of Queen Elizabeth I in ''Elizabeth I,'' an HBO prime-time production. As a leading man, Mr. DiCaprio will compete against Ryan Gosling in ''Half Nelson,'' Peter O'Toole in ''Venus,'' Will Smith in ''The Pursuit of Happyness'' and Forest Whitaker in ''The Last King of Scotland.'' Ms. Mirren's competitors in the best actress category in feature films are Pen\u00e9lope Cruz in ''Volver,'' Judi Dench in ''Notes on a Scandal,'' Meryl Streep in ''The Devil Wears Prada'' and Kate Winslet in ''Little Children.'' Supporting actor nominees, besides Mr. DiCaprio, were Alan Arkin, Jackie Earle Haley, Djimon Hounsou and Eddie Murphy; supporting actress nominees were Adriana Barraza, Cate Blanchett, Abigail Breslin, Jennifer Hudson and Rinko Kikuchi. The winners will be announced at a ceremony to be broadcast from Los Angeles on TNT and TBS on Jan. 28.  Omarion Starting The New Year on Top  The new album by Omarion, below, ''21'' (Epic), captured the No. 1 spots on the Billboard post-Christmas 200 and R&B/Hip-Hop album charts, with sales of 119,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan estimates. Akon's ''Konvicted'' (SRC/Universal) climbed from 10th place to second even though sales declined more than 50 percent, to 112,000. The ''Dreamgirls'' (Sony) soundtrack vaulted from 31st to third place, despite a sales decline of 16.6 percent, to 104,000 albums; and last week's chart-topper, Nas's ''Hip-Hop Is Dead'' (Def Jam), fell to fourth place, with a 71 percent slump in sales, to 101,000. The Young Jeezy album ''The Inspiration'' (Def Jam) re-entered the Top Five, moving from 18th place to 5th.  Dead but Not Quite Buried  ''Zyzzyx Rd.'' has earned a place in the record book, Variety reported yesterday, for ''the lowest tally for any pic since modern record-keeping began in the 1980s.'' While films like ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,'' ''Cars'' and ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' were pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars last year, ''Zyzzyx Rd.'' (pronounced ZY-zix) amassed a total of $30. The film, starring Tom Sizemore, Katherine Heigl and Leo Grillo, opened its six-day run in February in Dallas, making $20 in its debut showing, followed by an additional $10. The plot of the 90-minute thriller, written and directed by John Penney, involves a philandering accountant (Mr. Grillo) who goes to Las Vegas on a business trip. There he encounters the seductive Marissa (Ms. Heigl) and her jealous ex-boyfriend, Joey (Mr. Sizemore), whom they kill and bury in the Mojave Desert, the site of Zzyzx Road in Zzyzx, Calif.

Its present show is a strong solo by the Congolese-born artist Aime Mpane, who divides his time between Kinshasa and Brussels.  Skoto's front gallery is given over to large sculptural installations that address Western pillaging of Africa, military and cultural, that gained full force in the late 19th century and continues. In one piece a tiny sculptural figure of a European soldier casts a huge drawn shadow on the gallery wall. In another, shown at the 2006 Dakar Biennial, the life-size figure of an African man, made entirely from matchsticks, stares at a grave marked 1885, the year Africa was definitively carved up and distributed among several European nations.  Even with colonialism ended, the mining of African culture continues, as suggested in a third sculpture, of the German artist and self-declared shaman Joseph Beuys kissing African feet. Some of the continuing effects of a disastrous past are evident in dozens of small paintings hung salon-style in the gallery's back room, all done during one of Mr. Mpane's recent stays in Kinshasa.  Most were painted at night by firelight or candlelight in a city short of electricity. (Mr. Mpane could fully see the paintings only hours after they were done, in daylight.) They are images made, like the whole show, of shadow and light, and they are extraordinary.  HOLLAND COTTER  ART IN REVIEW",

            "fulltext": "As the 64th annual Golden Globes unfolded on Monday, ''Babel'' won the award for best dramatic movie. And Martin Scorsese won for directing ''The Departed,'' while ''Dreamgirls'' scooped up awards for best comedy/musical and for a pair of its actors -- keeping the films in tight competition for top honors in the Hollywood awards race.  In a rather remarkable feat, Helen Mirren won best actress awards for playing two Queen Elizabeths: one for the television mini-series ''Elizabeth I'' and the second for portraying Elizabeth II in the film ''The Queen.''  Still, the evening's real significance lay in the ritual: Hollywood's first big awards party of the year was under way.  No film truly dominated the affair. Jennifer Hudson, a newcomer, won for best supporting actress in a motion picture for playing a determined but less-than-svelte singer in ''Dreamgirls,'' while the longtime Hollywood star Eddie Murphy -- himself a newcomer to awards glory -- won best supporting actor as a singer on the decline.  Dozens of television and movie stars braving unusually chilly temperatures made their way along 30,000 square feet of red carpet, the longest such artifact in the awards world, and were greeted by approximately 1,500 credentialed journalists, who could well have matched the number of guests at the event.  Mr. Murphy's and Ms. Hudson's wins gave early moments of triumph to ''Dreamgirls'' in a season in which no single film has dominated audience interest, or critical enthusiasm.  Bursting into tears, Ms. Hudson, who first gained notice on ''American Idol'' and had her first screen role in this film, told the audience filled with Hollywood's top movie and television stars: ''You don't know how much this does for my confidence. Because of this, it makes me feel like I'm part of a community, it makes me feel like an actress, and you don't understand how much that feels good today.'' Afterwards, Ms. Hudson dedicated her award to Florence Ballard, one of the original Supremes, ''a lady who never got a fair chance.''  Speaking to reporters after receiving his award, Mr. Murphy, whose career has seen a jagged series of highs and lows, said that, much like older women, actors of color can also find it difficult to land choice roles. ''Hey, I'm a minority, too,'' he said. ''It's tough to be a black person in this town as well.''  Forest Whitaker was named best actor in a dramatic movie for his portrayal of Idi Amin in ''The Last King of Scotland.''  And as she won best actress in a comedy or musical for ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' one somewhat older woman, Meryl Streep, rocked the gathering when she donned a pair of reading glasses and declared, ''I think I've worked with everybody in the room.'' She paused. ''Yes, I have,'' she concluded.  She won for playing an entertainingly monstrous fashion editor savaging her assistants, played by Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt. Ms. Blunt won her own Golden Globe, for best actress in a television mini-series, for ''Gideon's Daughter.''  The best foreign language film prize went to ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' an unusual twist, in that the movie, with dialogue in Japanese, was directed by Clint Eastwood. Backstage, Mr. Eastwood, positively ebullient, told the press that he might make a Hungarian or Lithuanian movie next. When he was asked to pose with a statue, he said, \"You want me to do my Paris Hilton.\"  The Globes are voted on by the 80 or so members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. By contrast, the Oscars are voted on by the nearly 6,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Throughout the night, those who made or starred in the dozens of contending movies and programs looked for any edge from the event.  Mr. Scorsese is now firmly a contender for this year's Academy Awards; he has never received that honor, despite repeated nominations.  Graham King, a producer of ''The Departed,'' said shortly before the show began: ''Of course I care. I didn't care yesterday. But now I care a lot. We're under a microscope right now, and the whole world is watching. A win would be nice.''  Sacha Baron Cohen was named best actor in a musical or comedy for his performance in ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.''  The box-office performance of the contenders for best dramatic picture was certainly uneven. ''Babel,'' which had the most Globe nominations, seven, has taken in only $21 million in this country. This multi-character drama about cultural misunderstanding across the globe, directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, vied for best picture in the drama category with Martin Scorsese's ''Departed,'' which had six nominations. That film, a bloody Irish mob drama with a scene-chewing performance by Jack Nicholson and a cast of younger stars, has been more like a blockbuster success, taking in $121 million in this country and about as much again overseas.  Other nominees for best film drama included ''Little Children,'' a sober story of married couples in suburbia; ''Bobby,'' which portrays the interlocking lives of people who meet on the night of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles; and ''The Queen,'' a character study of Queen Elizabeth II in the days following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.  The HBO film, ''Elizabeth I,'' also won best TV film, and won a statue for Jeremy Irons as best supporting actor in his portrayal of Elizabeth I's devoted admirer. Peter Morgan won best screenplay for ''The Queen.''  On the television side, Hugh Laurie won for best actor in a series, for his portrayal of a tortured, but talented doctor in ''House.'' He said he was surprised at the win, adding, ''I'm literally without a speech,'' and suggested that with all the presents that come to nominees, no one had thought to offer a free speech. ''There's a gap in the market,'' he said.  Alec Baldwin won for best actor in a television series, musical or comedy for his work in ''30 Rock.''  ''Ugly Betty,'' originally a hit Spanish-language telenovela brought to the United States and shown on ABC, won for best musical or comedy series. The cast, including the producer Salma Hayek and the co-star Vanessa Williams, poured onto the stage to celebrate. America Ferrera, fighting back tears and looking quite beautiful, won best actress in a comedy for playing the lead. ''Thank you for recognizing a character who is truly bringing a new face to television,'' she said, and for bringing a message to young girls that they are ''worthy and lovable.''  The Disney-Pixar film ''Cars'' won best animated feature, in the debut of the category for the Globes.  From the outset, ''Dreamgirls,'' with five nominations, was favored to win the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical. But it has yet to break out as a major hit at the box office, having taken in about $67 million so far in domestic markets.  Other nominees in that category included the mockumentary ''Borat''; ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' the independent hit about a dysfunctional family on the road to a children's beauty contest; ''The Devil Wears Prada''; and ''Thank You for Smoking,'' a satire about lobbying.  In addition to 25 awards for work during 2006, the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award went to the actor and filmmaker Warren Beatty for what the association called his ''outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.'' Mr. Beatty, 69, has made his mark as a political thinker and industry statesman, while directing five films and appearing in nearly two dozen since his 1961 performance in ''Splendor in the Grass.''  Following the event, celebrities, their guests and anyone who could find a way in were scheduled to attend at least seven parties, including two off-site. The physical feat of accommodating so many people can lead to extraordinary measures: HBO had work crews build a floor over the pool at the Beverly Hilton Hotel to accommodate the crowd.  The timing of the Globes -- right after Oscar nomination ballots have been returned, but before those results are announced -- makes for a significant stirring of the awards season tea leaves.  Because the Globes split feature films into two categories -- there are best picture awards for both drama and musical/comedy -- their implications for the Oscar race are not always easy to discern. Last year, ''Brokeback Mountain'' won the Globe for best dramatic picture, but ''Crash,'' an also-ran at the Globes, won the Academy Award for best picture.  This year, early awards season favorites like ''The Departed'' and ''Dreamgirls'' were not in direct competition. Yet several films and individuals arrived this year with much to be gained or lost. ''Dreamgirls'' fell short of early awards hype, and a win gave the musical much needed oxygen for the rest of the awards season.  ''Right now I'm conserving my energy for future projects,'' Mr. Scorsese said before the show of his decision not to campaign actively for awards after having often been spurned in the past. ''But it's good to be here.''  The Academy Award nominations are to be announced on Jan. 23, with the awards given on Feb. 25.",

Brad Grey, the head of Paramount Studios, argued that he deserved credit for his role in putting the film together, but the producers' branch of the academy, which decides who can accept the Oscar as the producer of the best-picture winner, determined on Thursday night that only Graham King was eligible. The same group decided that of the five people who have received credit for producing ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' another best-picture contender, only David T.

Movie lovers have a rare opportunity to see ''IL MAFIOSO,'' a little-known Italian movie that created a sensation when it was shown at the New York Film Festival last year. Released in 1962, well before Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola put their stamp on the genre, the film stars Alberto Sordi (known from Fellini films and many other movies) as a Sicilian named Antonio who has made good in Milan. He goes home to Sicily for a family reunion but finds that the old neighborhood is still mired in the culture of the mob, and that the ''capo di capi'' who made his legitimate life in a Milan Fiat plant possible has a favor to ask. And you know what kind of favor that will be. (It involves a gun.) The film is dark and funny and well worth the trip. It had only a limited release in the United States in the 1960s. Opens Friday, Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village, (212) 995-2000; and Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, 1886 Broadway, between 62nd and 63rd Streets, (212) 757-2280.  And the Two Boots Pioneer Theater is, for a week beginning Jan. 24, showing another rarely seen gem, the 1949 thriller ''SHOCKPROOF,'' directed by Douglas Sirk. A co-writer was the inimitable Samuel Fuller. In the film a probation officer played by Cornel Wilde takes into his charge a paroled she-killer played by Mr. Wilde's real wife, Patricia Knight. To keep her from a gangster boyfriend, he hides her at his blind mother's home; they end up on the run from the law, with the moralistic Wilde character finding himself on the wrong side of right.

            "fulltext": "WHEN the Hollywood studios did early Academy Awards planning this year, they assumed that ''Flags of Our Fathers'' and its director, Clint Eastwood, would be in the thick of things. An industry favorite, he and his films have been nominated three times for best director and best picture and won each twice. With Mr. Eastwood as director and Steven Spielberg as a producer, ''Flags of Our Fathers'' had pedigree, a portentous topic and ferocious backing from Paramount and DreamWorks.  But something funny happened on the way to the podium: Hardly anybody went to see the movie, and critics, who generally swoon when Mr. Eastwood is near, were respectful at best.  This being Hollywood, no one wishes ill of anyone of course -- at least not aloud -- but other parties with big Oscar bets on the table could not be blamed for breathing a collective sigh of relief.  Then in November word came that ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' the much smaller sibling of ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' would be released in December, and consequently be eligible for Academy consideration. While filming ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' about the men who raised the American flag on Iwo Jima, Mr. Eastwood became fascinated by the tenaciousness of the Japanese in a losing battle and conceived, then separately shot, ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' essentially documenting one of World War II's most vicious engagements from both sides. (There are some crisscrossing interests at work: Paramount/DreamWorks own the domestic release for ''Flags'' while Warner Brothers have the foreign rights for that film and both domestic and foreign rights for ''Letters.'')  The original plan -- rendered moot by the underperformance of ''Flags of Our Fathers'' -- had been to release ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' on Feb. 9, 2007, into what was hoped would be another round of post-Oscar nomination buzz. But emboldened by the ecstatic reception when ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' opened in Japan, Mr. Eastwood asked Warner Brothers to move up the release date, effectively reversing the polarity on the films in the long-shot hope that the little film would help the big one.  Warner Brothers has a storied history with Mr. Eastwood that includes a few recent bumps -- he had to drag out the tin cup and use every bit of star power to get both ''Mystic River'' and ''Million Dollar Baby'' made at the studio -- but this time it quickly said yes.  ''There was no long dialogue,'' Alan F. Horn, Warner's chief executive, said. ''We have a long-running, important relationship with Clint. He asked and we said, 'Fine, let's do it.' ''  The scheduling shift did not seem like that big a deal -- after all, it was a small-budget film, in Japanese no less -- but the critics started putting it on their 10 Best lists, the National Board of Review named it best film, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the keepers of the Golden Globes and longtime supporters of Mr. Eastwood, nominated him for not one but two director awards. (Under the association's rules ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' was not eligible for best drama because it is in a foreign language. Instead it received a nomination for best foreign film.) And at the end of last month the American Film Institute named Mr. Eastwood a ''national treasure'' for his two-pronged cinematic assault on Iwo Jima. In essence Mr. Eastwood re-entered the Oscar battle by switching to the losing side.  Mr. Eastwood is an industry favorite because of his ability not only to make first-rate films but to do so with the kind of grace and decency seldom seen in Hollywood. This is not the first time he came swinging out of the trees late in the year and altered the landscape. The release date for ''Million Dollar Baby'' was moved up in 2004, and it took the honors as best picture, passing ''The Aviator,'' directed by Martin Scorsese, late in the season.  For Mr. Scorsese, director of ''The Departed,'' a serious contender this year, it must seem like a bit of unwanted d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. And it creates a logjam of egos and marketing for Warner Brothers, which not only has ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' and ''The Departed,'' but ''Blood Diamond,'' a big budget, big-deal production that was known as a pet project of its star, Leonardo DiCaprio. Edward Zwick, its director, has been down this road before as well. He had a shot at one of the best picture nominations in 2003 with ''The Last Samurai,'' but ''Mystic River'' and Mr. Eastwood both took slots that year.  ''Blood Diamond'' received mixed reviews and underperformed at the box office, but still has very significant support at Warner Brothers, in part because Mr. Horn loves the film. Mr. Zwick said that he feels his movie has received plenty of attention and regards the awards as beyond anyone's control.  ''Every filmmaker feels uneasy about his work being lined up with or compared to another filmmaker's,'' he said. ''Warner Brothers has been nothing but remarkable in their continued support for this movie. They have carried through on every promise.''  Warner Brothers executives say they are happy to find themselves in the midst of what is, after all, a problem of opportunity.  ''Ultimately we try to figure out what is right for each movie and then find a way to make it work,'' said Dawn Taubin, president of domestic marketing at the studio. ''Yes, we had a busy schedule, but this seemed to be in the interest of both films,'' she said, referring to ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' and ''Letters From Iwo Jima.''  Studios generally schedule films with a mix of business metrics and from-the-gut mysticism, jockeying their way around behemoths and putting themselves in a position to crush smaller, weaker opposition. In a very crowded release schedule, especially at the end of the year, marketing must be prepared, trailers must be in place and the hype machine must be engaged. So once an opening date is set, it is switched only with great reluctance.  Unless it's Clint Eastwood who wants it switched. Mr. Eastwood is generally thought to be above a lot of Hollywood nonsense, but he has been both an actor and a politician. He knows how to campaign and is willing to weigh in on behalf of a project he cares about, which, at this stage of his career, includes all of them. Another Oscar is hardly the point, but it is materially significant.  Robert Lorenz, a longtime associate and a producer at Mr. Eastwood's production company, Malpaso Productions, said that awards were not a factor in the change of opening date. (Mr. Eastwood declined an interview request.)  ''I don't think it was calculated on Clint's part,'' Mr. Lorenz said. ''His instincts told him that this was best for the film, not in terms of awards, but you want people to see the movie that you made. The people who had seen 'Letters From Iwo Jima' were blown away by it, and that obviously stuck with Clint.''  There are those who suggest that in seeing to the needs of Mr. Eastwood, Warner Brothers gave a multiple-Oscar winner another bite at the apple in what was already a competitive year.  It is not just Warner Brothers that needs to manage around Mr. Eastwood's remarkable second wind. Paramount, which has both ''Dreamgirls'' and ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' is in the somewhat awkward position of both competing with and supporting him. That studio would be happy if ''Flags'' received more attention, but it would come at the expense of other projects and directors it holds dear, including Bill Condon, who was shut out in Globe nominations for ''Dreamgirls.'' (Mr. Eastwood received two.)  While there is enormous regard for Mr. Eastwood's storied career, there are significant resentments as well, as long as no names are involved. An executive who has several competing projects, fatigued at another year of going head-to-head with Mr. Eastwood, sniped about ''Letters From Iwo Jima'': ''Of course all the critics loved it. The movie takes place in caves and all of the critics live in them.''  Others can't help but be charmed by Mr. Eastwood's resurgence in the race. Anne Thompson, deputy film editor of The Hollywood Reporter, noted that Mr. Eastwood is formidable any year.  ''Sure, he's very low key, but he takes his films to Cannes and has courted critics over the long haul,'' she said. ''He cares deeply about how his films are received. Everyone adores him because, in the face of the inflated formulaic excesses of the studio system, he is still doing it the old way -- with an aesthetic and a sense of storytelling that people can't help but admire -- and continuing to do it over and over again.''  ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' puts a historic tilt on the current race. Other directors have been nominated twice in the same year -- Steven Soderbergh was nominated for both ''Erin Brockovich'' and ''Traffic'' in 2000. (He won for ''Traffic.'') But no other big-name director has split the same subject into two films. ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' belongs in the race, some say, because it is much more an Eastwood film, while ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' with its divergent plotlines and abundant flashbacks, seems to reflect his collaboration with Mr. Spielberg.  Regardless of how the awards shake out, the emergence of ''Letters'' does have the benefit of changing the subject for Mr. Eastwood. Rather than dwelling on why ''Flags'' failed to connect with audiences and awards in the same way his last two films had, the topic is once again Mr. Eastwood's ability to confound expectations.  It is neither a parlor trick nor a gambit. ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' is in the hunt because it is classic American filmmaking, give or take the subtitles. And whether it takes Mr. Eastwood back to the podium on Feb. 25, it represents the kind of innovation that the Academy is not in the habit of ignoring.  THE OSCARS",

            "fulltext": "THE evidence lay throughout the yard of a modest home on Burns Road. A jumble of driftwood in the corner of the pebbled driveway. A rock wall built without mortar. And, most tellingly, a stout cylindrical cairn, reminiscent of the mysterious one that appeared on a nearby beach around Christmas.  Shelter Island is a small community, especially in winter, when the swell of tourists and seasonal residents recedes. Those who remain know one another by name. Yet a sophisticated cairn was erected, almost six feet high, on the north side of the causeway that leads to Ram Island, and no one knew the builder's identity.  On Jan. 4, the local newspaper, the Shelter Island Reporter, featured a picture of the cairn, which is made of concentric layers of well-balanced stones that taper to a point at the top. Four driftwood posts run through it, creating a spiral pattern around the shaft, and the interior is filled with rocks. If you lean on the cairn, it does not budge.  ''There's so many possibilities,'' Karen Boltax said in her Boltax Gallery last Sunday afternoon. ''There's a lot of artists here.''  She did not realize then that she knew the builder and would be a key in unraveling the mystery.  A piece of driftwood propped against a tuft of golden grass a few feet from the cairn provided the first substantial clue: ''Maya Emma'' was scrawled in charcoal.  ''I have a friend named Maya,'' said Lena Cordts, 11, who had gone to the beach that sunny Sunday with friends and their parents, Sarah Sherwood and Chris Mulligan of Shelter Island. ''She has a sister Emma, too,'' Lena told a reporter who had also stopped by.  Lena said Maya and Emma lived near St. Mary's Episcopal Church. A trip there found a house with driftwood, stones and a cairn on the property. Its residents were not home, but that was where Ms. Boltax came in. She knew the house, she said: Gary Buckner, a social studies teacher at Mattituck High School, his wife, Valerie Marvin, and two daughters, Maya and Emma, live there.  ''Val and Gary are very hip people,'' Ms. Boltax said. ''It wouldn't surprise me if they did the sculpture.''  It turns out that Mr. Buckner built it, and he feels uncomfortable calling it a sculpture.  ''I don't think of myself as an artist,'' he said on Monday. ''I call it a cairn.''  He built the cairn from materials he found on the beach and worked on it each weekend in December, saying he put in a few meditative hours just after sunrise and sometimes at ''the setting of the day.'' He showed the structure only to family and friends visiting from Brooklyn on Christmas. He had hoped to remain anonymous to the rest of the island and said he did not realize his daughters had left their names behind.  Although several admirers likened the cairn to work by the environmental sculptor Andy Goldsworthy, Mr. Buckner said he did not intend to create a piece of art. It was homage, he said, to its location, a peaceful ribbon of shore where the water slides smoothly inland and cedar trees thrive in the sandy soil.  ''I thought it was appropriate to leave an offering to a place where we all go,'' he said. ''We go when we're angry and confused. We go for peace, for an answer, for understanding. We go there and then we leave, and that's it. I wanted to leave something somewhat permanent.''  Acknowledging that the cairn may one day be destroyed by nature or human hand, Mr. Buckner said: ''I wanted it to be an observer of time and change. Even in its destruction, that's time itself.''  Already, the cairn has changed. Visitors have stuck pieces of curled seashell and a long brown feather between the outer stones.  ''I'm totally drawn,'' Ms. Sherwood said as she gazed at the cairn. ''It's a strangely primitive emotional thing.''  She said she and her family had built cairns in their travels around the world. ''But I think the level of our sophistication will now increase,'' she said.  Indeed, 50 yards down the beach, her husband and children were busy piling rocks.  MYSTERY",

            "fulltext": "ONE day last month, Fran Brunn looked out a window of her home and noticed a white pickup truck driving up to the mailbox across the street.  ''I saw a man, who was not wearing a postal uniform, get out of the truck and walk over to the mailbox,'' Ms. Brunn, 74, recalled. ''At first I thought he was going to mail a letter, but then, to my surprise, he began pulling the mailbox out of the ground.''  Ms. Brunn, who has lived on Brooks Boulevard for 50 years, about 10 years before the mailbox was installed, hurried down her front steps to confront the man making the unusual pickup.  ''What are you doing?'' she asked.  ''I'm taking out the mailbox,'' he said, according to Ms. Brunn.  ''Why?'' she asked.  ''There isn't enough mail being put into this box on a day-to-day basis,'' the man explained. ''It's no longer worth the post office's time, so they asked me to remove it.''  According to George Flood, a United States Postal Service spokesman who is based in Newark, scenes like the one that unfolded in front of Ms. Brunn's home have been playing out across New Jersey, and the country, for the past year. The removal of mailboxes in Manville was merely the most recent in the state.  ''The market demand for mailboxes has been declining,'' Mr. Flood said. ''As a result, we have been removing them.''  Mr. Flood, who noted that a surge in electronic mailing is the main reason the mailbox is being labeled an anachronism, said that ''over the last five years, we have seen a decline on a nationwide level of five billion pieces of first-class mail.''  As a result, 28,000 mailboxes were removed across the country last year, although 267,000 remain -- 9,100 in New Jersey. In the past year, Northern New Jersey had more than 2,300 mailboxes removed, leaving 4,300 in place.  Mr. Flood said that while records had not been kept for mailboxes removed in other areas of the state, 1,190 remain in Central New Jersey. He said that local postmasters monitor each mailbox for volume over a two-week period, and if at least 25 pieces of mail are not dropped in the box during a single day, it is removed.  ''It's an issue of efficiency,'' Mr. Flood said, with too much staffing devoted to pickups. ''Besides, people can always leave outgoing mail in their own mailboxes.''  Pat McGovern, a Postal Service spokeswoman who is based in Manhattan, said that in addition to people corresponding by e-mail and paying bills online -- not to mention private shipping services like U.P.S. and Federal Express -- additional services have made customers less reliant on mailboxes.  As an example, she noted the Postal Service's Click-N-Ship service, which allows customers to print a shipping label at home and arrange for next-day pickup.  ''It's an increasing resource that people are using,'' she said. ''To not even have to leave your home to mail a package is a pretty easy way to conduct business.''  Ms. Brunn, who must now walk three blocks to her local post office to drop off mail, said she could understand why mailboxes were being removed, although she still felt as if an old friend had moved away.  ''I appreciated that mailbox a lot more after it was gone; like anything else, I took it for granted,'' she said. ''I thought my mail was safest in that box, and now that it's not available, I prefer walking to the post office as opposed to mailing stuff out of my own mailbox.''  One of Ms. Brunn's neighbors, Marty Geiger, a painting contractor who has lived on the block for 10 years, said he too had been inconvenienced by the removal of the mailbox.  ''I often send out letters and bills later in the day, long after the regular mailman makes his rounds,'' Mr. Geiger, 45, said. ''The mailbox across the street was great because it had a late-day pickup and an early-morning pickup, but now those options are gone.  ''I guess most everyone is now doing business online,'' he said with a sigh. ''But as far as traditional mailing goes, I'm sure there are still a few dinosaurs out there, like me.''  DOWNSIZING",

            "fulltext": "LYNN BIEDERMAN, 44, says this about her mother: ''Had we not been mother and daughter, our paths would never cross.''  Ms. Biederman lives in a woodsy part of northern Westchester County, in a big house full of comfy, country-style furniture. Though she has a full life with her husband of 20 years and their two teenagers, and her work as a children's book writer and part-time librarian, she loves to slack off, pad around the house, eat in, sleep late. ''I would do anything to stay in bed, in a room as dark as a cave, for as long as possible,'' she says.  Her mother, Judith West Edelman, a wealthy businesswoman who refuses to give her age (''If I have to tell you, the story's off''), lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 40th-floor apartment with a spectacular view of the East River, rooms full of spare modern furniture and lots of unshaded windows that let the light pour in at dawn -- which is when she gets up seven mornings a week to work out at her gym.  The daughter, who's in fine shape (5 feet 3 inches, 112 pounds), once made the mistake of using her mother's personal trainer. ''I was like, 'Lou, why you giving me so much weight?' He says: 'What do you mean? Your mother does more reps at a higher weight and she never complains.' ''  The daughter seeks to avoid conflict. The mother relishes a fight. (She interrupted our interview to take a call about a woman she is battling in her co-op over an allegedly oversized dog.)  The daughter prefers quiet getaways and hates the Hamptons. The mother likes fancy restaurants, has a big house in the Hamptons and loves the scene.  The daughter is a Democrat, the mother a Republican.  The daughter served me home-baked vanilla cake warm from the oven and homemade cappuccino; the mother's uniformed maid served herbal tea from tea bags and low-fat cookies from the health food store.  The mother is punctual and has no time for fiddle-faddle; the daughter's constantly late because she fiddle-faddles. One of the mother's favorite sayings is, ''Fast walker, fast thinker.'' One of the daughter's is, ''What's the rush, Mom?''  The daughter believes her children are entitled to an explanation. The mother believes her own two children and her four grandchildren should not be overindulged. One of the mother's quippy sayings to silence children: ''Why? Because it's a letter in the alphabet.''  The daughter works at home. She knows her 14-year-old daughter's taste in food, clothes and books and loves shopping for her.  The mother works in an office -- once an assistant to the late Milton Petrie, the renowned women's clothing retailer, she is now president of Westco, her retail fixture business. The mother was too busy working to go with the daughter to pick out a wedding dress and sent her mother-in-law, the grandmother.  For years the mother and daughter had a guarded relationship. Many of the daughter's best friends are women who aren't close with their mothers.  The mother was too consumed by work to make women friends. ''I liked to talk business, and not many women did,'' she says. ''Even as a kid, I was a loner. I began to see myself as not friendly or having social skills. I'd say, 'So what, I make a million dollars a year.' ''  But in the last few years, things changed between mother and daughter. They grew close. There was no epiphany, they agree. The mother's quippy saying for this is: ''I suppose it's an accumulation of two-way streets.'' Each woman realized she'd fallen into the same trap.  ''I strove to be the opposite of my mother,'' the daughter says.  And the mother? ''I grew up hungry to be different from my mother.''  Seeing the problem helped break the cycle.  The mother grew up poor in Dallas. She says her father, a traveling salesman, was a ''brutal'' bully. ''I saw my mother being pushed around. I myself was. My mother, poor thing -- any friends she had were losers in life. So I had to figure out for myself what kind of woman I wanted to be. No one was going to push me around. I saw very quickly a woman couldn't have a voice without economic independence.'' Her first glimpse of what she wanted came during an after-school job at a Dallas department store. ''Those Neiman Marcus women, that was the life I wanted. It stoked the fire.''  Even though her husband, Sanford Edelman, is a successful businessman, she has never lost her fear of being dependent and has never slowed in her career. She continues to work when most her age would retire. This is how she explains her unrelenting morning workouts: ''A pretty woman has a better chance in business. I used anything I had at my disposal to get the job done.''  When she worked with Milton Petrie (estimated at his death in 1994 to be worth nearly a billion dollars), she says: ''My viewpoint consisted of myself as a career success. It never occurred to me I could ask to get out early for my kids. Having my mother-in-law go for the wedding dress with Lynn worked for me. I realize now it's a pretty narrow way to live.  ''If you never had a fur coat, you never had a two-carat diamond or made $100,000, it seems like a big deal.''  What changed? ''Once you get those things, it's not a big deal. I didn't have a good relationship with my mother. I didn't want to die feeling I didn't have a good relationship with my children. I didn't want to perpetuate a legacy. Where does it stop?''  For a while, the daughter says, she wouldn't let her mother back in: ''She saw I had something with my children. She'd say, 'I probably wasn't as great a mother as you' and I'd let it hang there.''  And then, several years ago, the daughter began writing a novel for young adults and realized the mother character she'd created -- nicknamed the Captain -- was too harsh to be believable. As she rounded out the character, she grew to have empathy for her mother's hard life.  They disagree about who reached out first. ''I threw the baton out, and she grabbed it,'' the daughter says.  Says the mother: ''I worked on being a more accepting mother. If I want to say something, I let it go a day or two before bringing it up. Like negotiating in business.''  Over Christmas, the two families went for a week to Buenos Aires to celebrate the mother's secret milestone birthday. ''The day after we flew back, Mom was in the gym at 7,'' the daughter says. ''I couldn't move.'' Asked what she loves about her mother, she says: ''It took a lot of guts for my mom to change. There's not a thing she wouldn't do for me.''  As for the mother, she has a quippy saying to cover her half: ''Sometimes the chicken can learn from the egg.''  PARENTING",

In several basic ways, he shaped me: He was a newspaperman who valued education and family. But the most vivid memories I have of my childhood, I know, are not the ones he would have selected. Those memories have pushed me to try and be a different sort of parent than he was.  One of the most central influences he had on me -- developing my voice as both a writer and parent -- came about in ways that he never would have guessed and that I myself did not recognize until well into my adult years.  As a young reporter, I was constantly in search of my writer's voice, since I'd been told all real writers -- as opposed to journalists -- had one. In the early going, this produced ludicrous results as I discovered my voice was exactly the same as whatever literary giant's I happened to be absorbed in that week. (Particularly deadly for newspaper readers was my Faulkner phase.)  By my third newspaper and my 30th birthday, I had given up; I'd resigned myself to being a journalist without a voice.  And then one night after work at The Miami Herald, I went out to Johnny Raffa's Lobo Lounge with a terrific editor, Doug Balz. After a few beers, Doug asked where my distinctive writing voice came from.  I was stunned. Someone thought I had a voice? This was the moment I'd been waiting for, except I had no clue what my distinctive voice was. I had to ask him.  He told me I had an ability to poke fun at people in my writing, to accurately portray their foibles and yet still convey my genuine affection for them.  And the moment he said it, I knew where it came from. My ''writer's voice'' was the mechanism I'd developed that let me live with my father and hold onto his love. The voice was so central to my being while growing up, it was inaudible to me.  My dad was a good, loving man, but difficult and troubled. On the street where we grew up, the houses were so close together every neighbor could hear the next neighbor's business. We knew who the drinkers were, who the adulterers were, who was out of work. Dad was none of these. He drank in moderation, came home to my mother and worked steadily as a newspaper copy editor -- seven days a week at one point, to put us through college.  But as the whole block had to know, Dad was a vicious screamer. He was floridly profane and verbally abusive, usually toward my mother, and it could go on, with rest breaks, for hours. Throughout high school, I did not bring home friends for fear my father would have one of his explosions.  It wasn't until after he died, in 1980, at the age of 65, that I got some insight into his rage. Piecing it together with family members, I guessed that my father suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mental illness that can compel people to obsessively repeat rituals. In some ways, this served my dad well. He was the slot man at The Boston Herald -- the final person to check stories before they were printed, to pore over every piece of copy to make sure no error got into the paper.  Today, this illness has become a part of mainstream culture. My father most likely had the same disorder as the amusing private investigator on the TV show ''Monk.''  However, if there were funny parts when I was growing up, I don't remember them. I do remember, as a boy, catching my father repeatedly washing his hands, then seeing him struggle to turn off the bathroom light with his elbow to avoid germs. It's not hard to imagine why he'd build up rage inside, having to deal daily with a humiliating disorder that he did not understand.  Somehow, in the course of my childhood, I found the voice to let him know he was behaving badly, to convey the message in a way that communicated my love and, at times, defused his rage. My mother used to say, ''Michael, you're the only one who can placate your father.'' I'd guess that what reached him as much as my words was a child's na\u00efve attempt to make things right.  He was so mercurial -- from cruel to remorseful and back -- that he forced us to feel deeply and often. He could launch into a screaming fit if the kid next door accidentally kicked a ball into our yard, and if I got up the courage to challenge him -- ''He's a good kid, Dad, what do you think, he did it on purpose, Dad? We do the same thing, Dad.'' -- he'd stomp upstairs. Then, just when everyone was drained and humiliated and hoping he'd never come down again, there were the footsteps on the stairs, and we braced for the next explosion. ''You boys want to take a ride and get some ice cream?'' he'd say on a good day.  Besides my writer's voice, he influenced my own parenting style, though not in the ways he would have guessed. That same voice I used on my dad I use on my kids to make sure they know how much I love them even as I'm grounding them. I also repeatedly remind my kids that their friends are welcome at our home. And I've always strived to avoid arguing with my wife in front of our children. I've sworn a silent oath never to do to my kids what my father did to me.  PARENTING E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com",

            "fulltext": "When the police entered an apartment near St. Louis yesterday looking for a 13-year-old boy who had disappeared 60 miles away on Monday, they found him and a bonus: another Missouri teenager who had been missing for more than four years.  Officers found William Ownby, who vanished after stepping off a school bus in Beaufort on Monday afternoon, and Shawn Hornbeck, a 15-year-old who was last seen riding a bicycle near his home in Richwoods in October 2002, inside the rental apartment, in Kirkwood, Mo.  Sheriff Gary Toelke of Franklin County told reporters that both boys appeared dazed but unharmed.  Officers arrested Michael Devlin, 41, who lived in the apartment, and charged him with one count of first-degree kidnapping. Mr. Devlin was being held on $1 million bond.  Robert Parks, the prosecuting attorney of Franklin County, told reporters that Mr. Devlin had confessed to the crime and added that more charges were likely to be filed in the case.  Sheriff Toelke said officers were questioning Mr. Devlin, who worked as a pizza-delivery dispatcher and on the overnight shift in a funeral home, to try to determine a motive behind the abductions. Mr. Devlin's name was not found in a check of the Missouri Highway Patrol's registry of sex offenders. Similarly, a search of Missouri court records revealed no criminal history.  In Beaufort, family and friends of William, a Boy Scout known as Ben, had been conducting a full-scale search yesterday for the boy. He was last seen dashing home from the school bus on Monday. A schoolmate told the authorities that he saw a dilapidated white pickup truck with a camper shell speeding away from the spot.  An intense hunt ensued in rural Franklin County. Members of the Ownby family appeared on television to make tearful appeals for the boy's return. Community members plastered fliers throughout the area and ventured out on foot, horseback and all-terrain vehicles looking for clues.  The break in the case came Thursday evening when two Kirkwood police officers, out to serve a warrant at the apartment complex where Mr. Devlin lived, spotted a white truck that matched the description, Sheriff Toelke said. The blocklong single-story complex is just off Interstate 44 near a collection of industrial buildings.  The Kirkwood police contacted the Franklin County Sheriff's Department, located Mr. Devlin's address and returned the next day to find Ben and, to their surprise, Shawn Hornbeck, in the apartment, he said.  Sheriff Toelke said that Shawn identified himself to officers when they entered the home. He had disappeared on Oct. 6, 2002, when he was 11. His parents had reported him missing after he rode to a friend's house on a lime-green mountain bike wearing a Little League jersey but never arrived.  Ben, who was wearing a red shirt and jeans yesterday, appeared somewhat dazed when he was reunited with his family around 5 p.m. at the sheriff's office, Sheriff Toelke said. He added that Shawn's parents were coming to meet their son at the same location.  ''There are a lot of things we don't know right now,'' he said.  At Imo's Pizza in Kirkwood, where Mr. Devlin worked, a manager declined to comment. At the Bopp Chapel, where he worked the overnight shift, Susan Waterman, a funeral director, declined to comment on the situation, saying the chapel would release a statement today.",

            "fulltext": "Wearing a black velvet coat and a patterned blouse, the 86-year-old mother of the dead woman looked birdlike and frail as she walked to the witness stand.  She remembered the last time she spoke to her daughter, Christine Odierno, by telephone.  ''Mom, I gave Ben the divorce papers, and he went bananas,'' the mother, Jennie Kramer, told the jury in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday, quoting her daughter. ''He's going to kill me, Mom. He's going to kill me. He's going to kill me.''  With that, Mrs. Kramer leaned forward, her head collapsing into her hands, and cried.  It was the most emotional moment in the first day of the murder trial of Benjamin Odierno, accused of stabbing his wife, Christine, to death on April 24, 2005, in the kitchen of their Upper East Side town house, where she was cutting lettuce for dinner.  Prosecutors say Mr. Odierno, 72, killed his wife, who was 57, three days after she gave him divorce papers -- purposely handing them over in a public place, they say, because she was afraid of him. They say she was a long-suffering victim of domestic abuse that always stayed hidden within the thick walls of their home on East 84th Street.  When the police arrived, said the prosecutor, Kerry O'Connell, ''she was able to draw enough breath to say, 'My husband did this. My husband stabbed me in the heart.' ''  The defense lawyer, Jack Litman, agreed that Mr. Odierno killed his wife. But he said that it was in self-defense, and that it was she who had been tormenting him, forcing him to see a psychiatrist.  ''He never raised a hand to her,'' Mr. Litman said. ''He acted and reacted instinctively to save his own life after she stabbed him.''  He said Mr. Odierno, a landlord, had traumatic amnesia that prevented him from recalling the details of the night his wife died. The police, responding to a 911 call reporting a woman's screams, said that when they arrived they found Mr. Odierno stabbing himself in the abdomen.  But what emerged most clearly from the first day of the trial was a portrait of a family deeply divided, in which some members take Mrs. Odierno's side, and others, including the couple's two grown sons, take her husband's.  Mr. Litman told jurors that the sons would testify on behalf of their father. They would describe, he said, how their mother had grown increasingly unstable over the last eight or so years of her life. She became very thin, and ate only lettuce for dinner, obsessively separating the white parts from the green parts, Mr. Litman said in his opening statement.  He said that Mrs. Odierno had exiled her husband from the couple's bedroom, forcing him to sleep in a single bed in a room he shared with Marcus, the younger son. She hoarded hundreds of rolls of toilet paper in the basement, Mr. Litman said, and screamed that her husband was abusing her loud enough for the neighbors to hear, yet nobody ever reported seeing any bruises.  Mr. Litman hammered on the family divisions during cross-examination of Mrs. Odierno's mother.  ''You have a son, right?'' he asked Mrs. Kramer, who had testified that she was the mother of three daughters, including Christine, and a 61-year-old son, Bill.  ''Not anymore,'' she replied.  ''Now of course, Bill is still alive, isn't he?''  ''I think so,'' Mrs. Kramer replied.  ''The reason you're saying you don't know is because Bill supports Benjamin Odierno, is that right?'' Mr. Litman asked.  ''I have no idea what you mean,'' Mrs. Kramer said.  ''Did you see your son at the funeral?'' Mr. Litman asked.  ''Yes,'' Mrs. Kramer said.  ''Did you see him as a pallbearer?''  ''I think he was,'' Mrs. Kramer said. ''I'm not certain.''  Mr. Litman had no further questions.",

            "fulltext": "ON a dark, rainy evening last fall, a 78-year-old man with Alzheimer's headed out the front door of his home in Morris County, N.J., and started walking toward a grocery store. His frantic wife, having walked downstairs and realized he was gone, called the Morris County Sheriff's Office to report him missing. Twelve minutes after officers arrived at the house, they found him almost three miles from his home.  The man was wearing a special electronic bracelet from a nonprofit company in Virginia called Project Lifesaver, and Sgt. Moire Reilly of the Sheriff's Office credits the program for that rescue and a half-dozen others in the county in the past three years.  Project Lifesaver began as a program to help elderly residents but has been expanded, especially to autistic children, and its bracelets emit a radio signal that can be tracked by special police equipment. Police officials say that having the bracelet can greatly speed up finding a missing person.  ''This is so valuable, and it gives the caregiver some peace of mind,'' Sergeant Reilly said.  ''If it had not been for the bracelet, we would have had to deploy 50 to 100 people to find him,'' she said of the 78-year-old.  And the risks for those not in the program who wander off are great, she said. ''The people will end up getting hurt,'' Sergeant Reilly said. ''They won't look both ways to cross the street. They are very fragile and may fall and need help.''  Sixty-six Morris County residents have the tracking devices. Project Lifesaver is now used in all 21 counties in New Jersey, and the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office on Long Island just became the seventh agency in New York to use it. It is not in use in Westchester County, and Connecticut is one of only 10 states that do not have Project Lifesaver.  Suffolk County, which gets about 100 calls a year about people having wandered away, acquired the equipment at the end of last year and has begun making the electronic bracelets available. ''We thought it was a great product,'' Sheriff Vincent F. DeMarco said. ''The whole key is finding people fast.''  In New Jersey, 26 law enforcement agencies use Project Lifesaver. This spring, the Gloucester County Sheriff's Office will be the last of the state's 21 sheriff's offices to add the program, said Edward V. Rochford, the Morris County sheriff and president of the Sheriffs' Association of New Jersey. It will make New Jersey the first state to install the system voluntarily in every sheriff's department. (Vermont requires it, he said.)  In the last few months, the Hudson County Sheriff's Office and the Fairfield Police Department in Essex County started the program in New Jersey. Several other departments, like the Bergen County Sheriff's Office, have offered it for four years, but expanded coverage last year to children with autism.  Ocean County has had the system since 2003 and has rescued four people wearing the devices, all within five minutes of the authorities' arrival, said Lt. Michael Osborn of the county Sheriff's Department.  Monmouth County, which has had the program since October 2003, has rescued five elderly people using Project Lifesaver, each taking less than 30 minutes, Sheriff Joseph W. Oxley said. ''It's been a phenomenal success,'' he said.  The idea for Project Lifesaver originated in 1998 when Gene Saunders, now its chief executive, was a member of the Chesapeake Police Department in Virginia. ''I went on a number of searches for Alzheimer's patients, and some ended well and some did not,'' he said.  In 1998, Mr. Saunders saw a brochure from a sheriffs' conference about radio tracking devices. ''It had to be better than what we were doing,'' he said. In the past, Mr. Saunders said, the plan was for the authorities to ''start pounding the ground and hope you'll run across them or a clue or some tracks.''  In 1999, he bought the tracking equipment with the help of a grant from a local hospital and began running the program for the Chesapeake Sheriff's Office as a volunteer. Some ensuing searches were completed in as little as five minutes, he said.  In 2001, Mr. Saunders retired after 33 years in the Police Department and started Project Lifesaver. There are now 558 agencies participating in 40 states and Canada, he said, with about 22,000 people wearing the bracelets. There have been more than 1,450 rescues, and no one wearing the tracker has been found seriously or fatally injured, he said.  Project Lifesaver says the average rescue time for people using its equipment is 26 minutes. The average time without the bracelets is nine hours, Mr. Saunders said.  The equipment carried by law enforcement officers can track from about a one-mile radius on the ground and five to seven miles from the air.  Many departments have not had to use the equipment often, but officers do not seem to regret buying it and paying for the training, which together cost about $8,000. Clients pay about $10 a month for the bracelets and battery changes, although local agencies sometimes subsidize the fee for the bracelets.  In Bergen County, which has had the program for four years, two people, both elderly, who were wearing the bracelets have been found, both quickly, said Ben Feldman, a Sheriff's Office spokesman. ''It's rare it's called into action,'' he said, ''but it gives people a peace of mind.''  In the past two years, many sheriff's offices have expanded the program to autistic children. Mr. Saunders said a federal marshal who had an autistic child had suggested that the equipment could be very helpful for those who are autistic and might be prone to wandering away.  It is too soon to know how many autistic individuals will use the program and how successful it will be, said Paul A. Potito, the executive director of the New Jersey Center for Outreach and Services for the Autism Community, but he supports the project. ''The potential is tremendous, and a lot of our people tend to wander off,'' he said.  But keeping the bracelets on a person with autism can be difficult because some are very sensitive to what they wear, Mr. Potito said.  About 15 people in Middlesex County, N.J., half of them children with autism, have the bracelets, the Sheriff's Office said. Officers have not had to use the equipment and have concerns about how it will work in such a highly populated area, Sheriff's Officer Sandy Mackiewicz said. One child and one elderly person got the bracelet off, she said, but ''it is a sense of security for some people.''  One benefit of the bracelet has been a greater sense of security for the caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, said Barbara Rutan, director of client services for the Monmouth County Office on Aging. About 30 of its clients use the device. It gives the caretakers comfort that any missing Alzheimer's patient will be found relatively quickly, Ms. Rutan said.  In Fairfield, the police started the Project Lifesaver program after the local Women's Club said it would pay the $8,000 start-up costs. ''We felt it was a very worthwhile project,'' said Jeanne Restuccia, the club president. The club had read about the program and wanted it in Fairfield, she said.  While C. Lynn Centonze, the Fairfield chief, said that while she did not expect the system to be used a lot, she thought it was necessary.  ''You can't put a price on someone's life,'' Chief Centonze said. ''If it saves one life, it's worth it.''",

            "fulltext": "Police investigators sifted through what they said were few clues on Monday in the fatal shooting of a 52-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son, who were found on Saturday night in a basement apartment where they lived with the son's wife and two young children.  The mother, Amelia Garcia, is thought to have died at the scene, while her son, Ferneliz Cruz, died about 24 hours later, on Sunday night, at Stony Brook University Hospital, according to the police. Both were discovered by Mr. Cruz's wife, identified by investigators as Yesenia Hernandez, when she returned from a coin laundry with her two children, an 8-year-old boy, Yerneli, and a 2-month-old.  ''The 8-year-old came to our door jumping up and down screaming, 'My grandma and my daddy's dead,' '' said Darlene Kennedy, 32, who lives next door with her six children. ''I went with him to the bottom of the steps of their apartment. His mother was yelling in Spanish. I tried to pull her away from there.''  Detective Sgt. Edward Fandry of the Suffolk County police homicide squad said that Mr. Cruz and his wife had spent the early evening at a local self-service laundry with their two children.  Mr. Cruz returned home with several loads of washed and folded clothing while his wife waited for a final load to dry. She and the children arrived at the basement apartment about 20 minutes after he did, at 8:20 p.m., to find Mr. Cruz and Ms. Garcia lying in pools of blood. Ms. Garcia's body was in the kitchen; Mr. Cruz was found in an adjoining room.  Both had been shot more than once, but the police would not say how many times, or what type of firearm was used. There was no sign of forced entry or robbery.  ''We still do not have a clear understanding of what happened,'' Sergeant Fandry said. ''There is no motive, nothing going on that gives us anything yet.''  The family came from the Dominican Republic about 12 years ago, according to neighbors and the police. Ms. Garcia helped raise her son's children. Mr. Cruz worked at a local bakery, and may have held a second job as a waiter.  The police said there was no record of domestic violence in the family, or any history of problems with anyone in the family's large circle of relatives and friends.  Coram, about 50 miles east of Manhattan, is a community of working-class and poor people. Speculators are known to rent out many houses to parolees, including sex offenders, a practice that stirred bitter local protests here last year.  On Monday, some of the victims' relatives and friends helped Ms. Hernandez retrieve some of the family's belongings from the apartment. They carried away bags of shoes and clothing, cardboard boxes, and dozens of cleanly pressed white shirts on hangers.  Mrs. Kennedy, the next-door neighbor, watched from her door.  ''When the police came, I took Yerneli to my house,'' she said. ''He stayed with us until relatives came for him. My kids tried playing a board game with him to keep him occupied -- Monsters, Inc. But he kept wanting to go outside.''",

            "fulltext": "The son of an Upper East Side landlord accused of killing his wife in 2005 by stabbing her more than 40 times testified on behalf of his father yesterday, telling the story of a marriage that unraveled into madness.  For most of his life, the son, Marcus Odierno, 25, told a jury, his was a fairly happy family. The Odiernos vacationed in Florida and the Caribbean and welcomed relatives and friends to their town house on East 84th Street for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  But in 1997, things changed, he said. His parents stopped inviting anyone over. His mother ordered one of his friends out of the house because she found his cologne too strong, Mr. Odierno said, and began browbeating her family.  ''My mother did not want anybody in the house anymore,'' he said in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  As the first defense witness, Mr. Odierno said that it was his father, Ben Odierno, 72, who was being abused, and his mother, Christine Odierno, 57, who was the abuser -- not the other way around, as the prosecution has argued.  In many ways, it was a portrait of an ordinary marriage, with fights over household chores. But the conflicts somehow veered into violence.  He said that in the fall of 1997, his mother kicked his father out of their bed, forcing him to sleep in a twin bed in the children's room. The bed had been vacated by Marcus's older brother, Stephan, then 18, who had moved to a nearby apartment when he went to college. While Ben Odierno shopped and cooked, Mrs. Odierno called him a slob and a lazy bum, their son said, and frequently taunted him, saying, ''Piggy, piggy, oink, oink.''  Marcus Odierno said his mother began acting as if she were being abused, even though she was not. He said she would slam into him, Stephan or their father and yell: ''Get your hands off me! Don't touch me! You're hurting me!'' Then, he said, she would open the glass doors to the solarium ''and scream these accusations out into the backyard,'' for the neighbors to hear.  In the last year of her life, he said, Mrs. Odierno would hold a knife to her own throat and ask her husband and sons, ''What are you going to do, are you going to slit my throat?''  Jack Litman, Ben Odierno's defense lawyer, asked, ''Do you remember what knife she used?''  ''Sure,'' Marcus Odierno said. ''She used a sharp salad knife.''  Mr. Litman contends that on April 24, 2005, Mrs. Odierno turned that knife against her husband, stabbing him. He has said that his client reacted by grabbing another knife and stabbing his wife in self-defense. Mrs. Odierno ended up dead, stabbed in the heart.  Prosecutors say that Ben Odierno killed his wife in a rage because she had given him separation papers, and then stabbed himself in the abdomen.  Marcus Odierno's former girlfriend Allegra Lugo also testified yesterday, saying she had seen Mrs. Odierno yell that she was being abused when she was not.  Marcus Odierno said that while he and his father slept, his mother would come into their room and wake them by rummaging through the closet or turning off the air-conditioning. In the mornings, he said, she would lock herself in the bathroom for hours, refusing to get out when he needed to get ready for school.  Marcus Odierno said that his mother, who had never cursed around him before, became more and more foul-mouthed in the last year of her life, and accused her husband of cheating on her.  In the months before his wife's death, Ben Odierno lost about 50 pounds, but remained ''docile'' despite his wife's abuse, their son said.  When the jury was out of the room, Mr. Litman and his fellow counsel, Todd Terry, told the judge, Justice Gregory Carro, that Marcus Odierno had begun to suspect that his father had Alzheimer's disease.  In another conference with the judge, the prosecutor, Kerry O'Connell, said Mrs. Odierno had begun shunning her husband and sons not because she was mentally ill, but because she loathed them.  Under cross-examination, Marcus Odierno said he had been kicked out of high school for bad grades, and conceded that he was living on money provided by his father.  ''Would it be fair to say that your days were spent doing whatever leisure activities you wanted to do?'' Ms. O'Connell asked him.  ''Pretty much,'' he said.  Was it true, Ms. O'Connell asked, that his mother managed the family's real estate business, keeping the books, paying the taxes and dealing with city agencies? It was, he said.  Ms. O'Connell asked whether his mother had also given him money.  ''My mother refused to give me money,'' he said.  Correction:  February 3, 2007, Saturday  An article last Saturday about the murder trial of Ben Odierno, a Manhattan landlord accused of killing his wife, Christine, referred incorrectly to her injuries and to a defense witness, Allegra Lugo. According to prosecutors, Mrs. Odierno had more than 40 injuries on her body, including scrapes, cuts, bruises and stab wounds; she was not stabbed more than 40 times. Ms. Lugo is a former girlfriend of the Odiernos' son Stephan -- not of his brother, Marcus. The article also misstated a point made by a prosecutor, Kerry O'Connell. She said that Mr. Odierno and his sons loathed Mrs. Odierno, not the other way around.",

Abducted four years apart, William Ownby and Shawn Hornbeck were freed on Friday, and they smiled sheepishly on Saturday as their families held back-to-back news conferences to discuss their boys' astonishing rescue.  Dressed in a checked shirt, blue jeans and a pair of oval glasses, William, 13, who is known as Ben, was instructed not to speak to reporters. Looking up occasionally, Ben clung close to his family as they rejoiced at the turn of events.  ''We're just ecstatic,'' Ben's mother, Doris Ownby, said. ''We don't want to let him go out of our sight.''  Sheriff Gary Toelke of Franklin County said the kidnapping suspect, Michael Devlin, 41, had confessed, but added that he could not discuss details of the investigation.  Robert Parks, the Franklin County prosecuting attorney, has charged Mr. Devlin, a pizzeria manager, with one count of first-degree kidnapping. He was being held on $1 million bond.  Emotions ran high in neighboring Washington County, where Shawn entered the balloon-festooned gymnasium at Richwoods Elementary, his old school. Wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt and sporting a shaggy head of hair and pierced lower lip, Shawn grasped his mother's hands. Also told not to speak to reporters, he laid his head on his mother's shoulder as she spoke.  ''I still feel like I'm in a dream, only this time it's a good dream, not the nightmare I've had to live for the past four-and-a-half years,'' his mother, Pam Akers, told reporters.  Shawn's stepfather, Craig Akers, said he and his wife had been in disbelief when they were all reunited.  ''There was that split second of shock,'' Mr. Akers said. ''Once I saw the face, I said, 'Oh my God, that's my son.' ''  Shawn, now 15, vanished on Oct. 6, 2002, when he was 11. His parents reported that he had last been seen wearing a Little League jersey as he rode a bicycle to a friend's house in Richwoods, Mo., a rural town about 65 miles southwest of St. Louis.  Ben, a Boy Scout and a straight-A student, disappeared on Monday afternoon after stepping off a school bus and running down a gravel road toward home in the rural town of Beaufort, Mo., about 60 miles west of St. Louis.  Ben's disappearance prompted an intense search of hilly Franklin County. Investigators said they had been following about 500 leads in the case, though they had focused on a tip from one of Ben's friends who had reported seeing a dilapidated white pickup with a camper shell speeding away from the place where Ben disappeared.  ''Basically, that's all we had,'' Sheriff Toelke said.  Investigators got a break on Thursday when Kirkwood police officers, Gary Wagster and Chris Nelson, arrived at Mr. Devlin's apartment complex in suburban St. Louis. They were serving a warrant in an unrelated case but noticed a small white truck matching the description of the one in the Ownby investigation.  After questioning Mr. Devlin at the pizzeria, officers searched his ground-floor apartment on Friday.  Sheriff Toelke said Shawn identified himself to officers as having been missing for four-and-a-half-years when they entered the home.  Roland Corvington, special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told reporters that when officers entered the apartment, Ben asked: ''Are you going to take me home?''  The boys had no visible injuries. Ben's parents said that on Friday night he was eager to play video games and go to bed.  Mr. Devlin, who managed an Imo's Pizza in Kirkwood, also worked part-time answering phones overnight at Bopp Chapel funeral home there.  ''He was prompt, well-mannered and very efficient,'' Jim Moyers, a funeral director at Bopp Chapel, said in a statement.  Neighbors who lived across from Mr. Devlin's run-down red brick apartment were less generous. They described Mr. Devlin as an immense, bearded man with wire-rimmed glasses who kept to himself. They said that he did not appear to have been keeping secrets, but that he was combative and antisocial.  One neighbor, Mario Emanuel, 29, said that about three months ago Mr. Devlin called the police on a visitor who took his parking space.  Referring to Shawn, Mr. Emanuel, an installation technician for DirecTV, said, ''When the police came, they talked to Devlin and the son -- who turned out not to be the son -- they talked to the police. If they would have investigated across the board, they would have had him.''  Tom Ballman, a Kirkwood police officer, confirmed that Mr. Devlin had summoned the police to the apartment complex, a two-story working-class enclave in the otherwise well-to-do suburb.  Another neighbor said her husband had also had tense encounters with Mr. Devlin over the space.  ''The parking spot thing was weird,'' the neighbor, Krista Jones, said. ''He woke us up one night because he was honking in the parking lot at like 2 o'clock in the morning. Someone had parked in his space.''  ''My husband almost beat him up,'' she added.  Ms. Jones said that Mr. Devlin kept the blinds drawn, though she would occasionally see Shawn riding his bike in the evening and that the boy was occasionally visited by what appeared to be a friend and a girlfriend.  A check of Mr. Devlin's name with the Missouri Highway Patrol's sex-offender registry turned up nothing. And a search of Missouri court records revealed no criminal history.  Mr. Parks declined to divulge information about how the boys had spent their time in captivity, but added that more charges were likely to come. ''It's my hope that he never sees the outside of jail in his natural life,'' Mr. Parks said.  Mr. Corvington of the F.B.I. said his agency was also looking into federal charges.  For the time being, though, the families said they were more interested in reconnecting with their rescued sons than worrying about Mr. Devlin's fate.  ''We've got a lot of catching up to do,'' said a tearful Pam Akers, marveling at her teenage son's growth. ''He's grown up on me, that's for sure.''",

            "fulltext": "The North Carolina State Bar filed a second, more serious round of ethics charges yesterday against the district attorney in Durham, N.C., accusing him of ''systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion'' in the sexual assault case against three former members of the Duke University lacrosse team.  The bar complaint said the district attorney, Michael B. Nifong, had illegally withheld DNA evidence from defense lawyers and then intentionally misled the presiding judge and bar officials about doing so.  The new charges added to a previous ethics complaint accusing Mr. Nifong of making false and prejudicial remarks about the case to the news media. A three-member independent panel is expected to hear the matter against him this summer. Penalties could include disbarment.  Mr. Nifong's lawyer, David B. Freedman, denied yesterday that there had been ''any sort of intentional unethical conduct.'' In a telephone interview, Mr. Freedman said that Mr. Nifong had a ''flawless record'' for ethics in 28 years as a prosecutor and that a written response, to be issued within 30 days, would give his side of the case.  ''I have great confidence the panel will render a fair and just verdict,'' Mr. Freedman said.  The case against the former players is being reviewed by the state attorney general's office, which took it over from Mr. Nifong after he recused himself on Jan. 12. At the time, he said he faced a conflict of interest between prosecuting the case and defending himself against the first set of ethics charges, filed Dec. 28.  Much of the new ethics complaint focuses on Mr. Nifong's handling of private DNA testing and his remarks to a judge and bar officials about it. Those tests were arranged by Mr. Nifong after a state laboratory found no semen, blood or saliva from lacrosse players on or in the woman or on her clothes. Using a more sophisticated test, the private laboratory found DNA from multiple men on the woman and her underwear, but none from any of the lacrosse players.  Mr. Nifong and the lab director decided to tell defense lawyers only about the positive matches, including a link to the woman's boyfriend, in a summary report of the DNA work, said the bar, a state agency that regulates lawyers in North Carolina. The negative findings, which the bar said ''tended to negate the guilt of the accused,'' were included only in laboratory reports not given to defense lawyers for more than six months.  North Carolina law requires prosecutors to share all relevant information with defense lawyers promptly. Mr. Nifong told the judge in the case that he had turned over everything he had -- ''a misrepresentation and false statement of material fact made to a tribunal,'' the bar wrote. Mr. Nifong later objected to a defense request to turn over the full laboratory reports, citing cost and privacy concerns and terming the papers sought ''a witch hunt list,'' the bar said.  Mr. Nifong said in court on Dec. 15 that a defense motion two days earlier on the withheld DNA results was ''the first I heard of this particular situation.'' Later he said he had meant that it was the first he had heard of defense accusations that the results had been concealed, not that they existed. But the bar said the accusations themselves had not been raised until after Mr. Nifong spoke in court.  In an interview last month, Mr. Nifong agreed that the DNA results had been potentially exculpatory, but said they had not seemed important to him because he was no longer then pursuing the case on the basis of DNA evidence.",

Michael Grandinetti, a resident of the Northern Mariana Islands, a United States territory in the Pacific, entered his plea before Judge Thomas P. Griesa in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Grandinetti is expected to serve as a witness for the prosecution in a mammoth tax shelter case against 16 former employees of the accounting firm KPMG.  Mr. Grandinetti, 49, becomes the fifth person to plead guilty and agree to cooperate with prosecutors in the inquiry, which has also ensnared major accounting firms, banks, law firms and investment boutiques.  His testimony could also aid federal prosecutors in Manhattan as they conduct a criminal inquiry into Deutsche Bank over questionable tax shelters.  A lawyer for Mr. Grandinetti declined to comment yesterday.  Mr. Grandinetti, identified in the felony information filed against him as a former partner at one of the world's largest accounting firms, admitted to lying to a federal prosecutor and to an Internal Revenue Service agent last March, when asked about his corporation's participation in questionable tax shelters known as Zens.  At the time, Mr. Grandinetti was a senior executive at the United Micronesia Development Association, an investment corporation based in Saipan, the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands. The entity bought Zens tax shelters in 1996 and 1997 to shield it artificially from income taxes due on its management of television, tourism, airlines and telecommunications assets.  Deutsche Bank marketed four Zens shelters to unnamed clients in the late 1990s, according to a previously reported court filing by prosecutors in the case against the KPMG defendants. Zens is the corporate version of a questionable tax shelter known as Cards, which is at the center of the criminal inquiry of Deutsche Bank.  Mr. Grandinetti admitted to sharing secretly in millions of dollars in fees paid by the corporation to unnamed promoters of the Zens shelters. In his plea agreement, he admitted to falsely telling federal investigators that he had told his corporation's board members about the use of the shelters, when in fact he did not. He faces a maximum of five years in prison, and will be sentenced next January.  A spokesman for Deutsche Bank did not return calls for comment late yesterday. Mr. Grandinetti also admitted to working with co-promoters of the questionable shelters, including an accountant based in Denver and one in Los Angeles. While the felony information does not identify the two accountants by name, based on previous court filings they are two of the KPMG defendants, Robert Pfaff and David Greenberg.",

An assistant district attorney, Linda Ford, said during the arraignment of the lawyer, Paul W. Bergrin, that he had not only helped run a brothel at 79 Worth Street in Lower Manhattan but had patronized the establishment and had brought friends to the brothel for free sex.  But a lawyer for Mr. Bergrin, Jeffrey Lichtman, accused the district attorney's office of inflating the seriousness of the charges by asking that his client be held in jail without bail.  ''Counsel can only surmise that the tremendous publicity surrounding this case and the district attorney's personal feelings toward the defendant have influenced the draconian request for detention,'' Mr. Lichtman wrote in a brief.  Justice Michael R. Ambrecht of State Supreme Court in Manhattan later set Mr. Bergrin's bail at $1 million bond or $500,000 cash, with 72 hours for prosecutors to review the source of the money.  A spokesman for District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau declined to comment yesterday.  Mr. Bergrin, 51, of Morganville, N.J., is a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. He is accused of using two shell companies in 2004 and 2005 to launder $800,000 in credit card receipts from a call girl service based in TriBeCa named NY Confidential, prosecutors have said.

The family left Iowa in July 2005 when Ms. Alexander, who works for an investment management company, was transferred to Westchester County. At the time, the family found it too expensive to move their furniture, and for the next year and a half, they ate meals on a used kitchen table, and two of Ms. Alexander's sons, Shareef, 10, and Shakir, 12, slept on mattresses on the floor.  In mid-December, the family came home one Sunday night to a visibly more comfortable house. Over the course of a weekend, some four dozen volunteers with the Red Chair Project, a new Westchester-based nonprofit group, had given the house a top-to-bottom cleaning, painted the interior and used two truckloads of donated furniture to fill it with items like couches, an armoire, end tables, framed pictures, a computer, a king-size sleigh bed for Ms. Alexander (who is going through a divorce), and new bedroom furniture for Shareef and Shakir and her two other children, Indigo, 13, and Kenneth, 16.  When the family came home (Red Chair had paid to have them spend the night at a hotel), Frank Sinatra was singing on a donated stereo system in the newly outfitted dining room, and a red chair had been placed in the living room.  ''It's hard to soak it all in, but this is like a home now,'' an astonished Ms. Alexander said.  Some nonprofit groups focus mostly on building homes for those who need them, while others sell donated furniture to raise money for special causes. But the goal at the Red Chair Project is to collect furniture that is no longer needed (and which many charities are now reluctant to pick up) and use it to furnish homes whose occupants cannot afford to do so on their own.  The group's trademark is a donated red chair, which the group's volunteers have left behind in the houses of the three families they have helped to date. ''It's a symbol of comfort and stability, a reminder to the family that they're not alone,'' said Patricia Cozine, a Rye resident who is one of the group's founders.  Ms. Cozine, an accessories designer, founded the group in October 2005 with two friends from Rye, Keith and Theresa Spencer, and Javier Viera, who was then the pastor of Mamaroneck United Methodist Church and has since moved on.  The group still works closely with the church and with other local community organizations, like the Hispanic Resource Center and the Shiloh Baptist Church in New Rochelle, to help locate families in need of furniture and furnishings.  So far, Red Chair volunteers have collected some seven truckloads of furniture through word of mouth or by soliciting big-box retailers like Linens 'n Things. But help has also come, they say, from many locally based businesses, like Chatsworth Furniture, Harrison Paint Supply, Bilotta Kitchens, Sound Shore Liquor Pantry, and Contemporary Moving Systems, a Mount Vernon moving company that was founded by John Rieman and Frank Maro in 2000.  When Mr. Rieman arrived at the home of Ms. Alexander and her children last month, he was driving a truck of furniture collected by his company in New York City, where it delivers furniture for retailers like Lillian August and Ligne Roset.  ''When we make deliveries, a lot of times people don't want what's already there, and they can't find anyone else who is willing to take it from them,'' he said, as he helped unload a large, almost-new pine armoire.  James Bilotta, a co-owner of Bilotta Kitchens, said it was not unusual to see presumably time-pressed executives put in time for Red Chair, even if means scrubbing toilets.  ''I don't know who gets the most out of this -- the people doing it or the people who live in the house,'' he said. ''It's not a charity where you just write a check -- it's one where you participate and also transform lives.''  Ms. Cozine said the group could use more warehouse space, as well as someone to help set up a Web site. For now, she said, e-mail messages can be sent to spencers@theredchairprojects.org.  Still, the group's efforts have already paid off. In Mamaroneck, Norma Galvez, 16, said that a refurbishing effort in October 2005 had made the house she shares with her mother and four siblings feel much more comfortable.  ''They did a pretty good job, for which we're very thankful,'' she said.  CHARITY",

By then they'd been married 13 years, had bought a three-bedroom, one-bath starter home here for $105,000, and felt safe that they'd reached the middle class.  Mr. Simard, a carpenter, was working steadily, building 25,000-square-foot houses for wealthy people in the Hamptons. Ms. Simard was helping with his business and selling kitchen utensils on the side. They had two children, Tom Jr., then 12, and Rachael, 8. ''Two was all we could afford when we was starting out,'' Ms. Simard says. Her husband was one of nine, and, as his wife says, ''often had to do without, and we didn't want that.''  As for Ms. Simard, her childhood was so awful, she'd never talked much about it to her husband. When she was 20 and they were courting, she says, ''he was the first man who was gentle and sweet, not wanting to attack me, not making comments about sex all the time. If he knew what I'd been through, I was afraid he'd treat me fragile.''  Her big idea: ''We was watching TV. I said, 'What do you think of taking in foster kids?' He said, 'I don't know, why would you want to?' ''  Over the next year, Ms. Simard says, she told him just enough to win him over. ''He still don't know all of it,'' she says. She told him that her mother had been a drug-addicted prostitute; that her early years in Brooklyn had been spent in boarded-up buildings, on the run from child welfare workers; that she had been sexually abused by a family member and at an early foster care placement; that she hadn't even known who she was until she was 12.  ''I thought I was Maritza Ruiz,'' she says. ''I thought my father was getting out of rehab and coming to take me and my brother out of foster care. I said, 'You come for me too?' He said, 'You're not my daughter.' '' Turned out her ''brother'' was a half-brother, her name Velez. ''Oh yeah, you get all these blows, but like a boxer you get back up.''  What saved her, she told her husband, was a foster mother, Margaret Stadier, who took her in from age 11 until she married. ''Treated me like I was hers. My husband didn't know a foster child's point of view. Now that he heard it, he says, 'O.K.' ''  For his part, Mr. Simard says he didn't make too much of his wife's stories. ''I just let it go as what happened before. I was just, 'O.K., let's try it, see what happens.' We just floated into it.''  Ms. Simard called the same agency that she says saved her, Little Flower Children and Family Services of New York. While Madonna and Angelina travel the planet to adopt, there's a plentiful supply right here. Federal officials report that each year 300,000 children need foster care; 118,000 are ready for adoption; and 19,000 age out, unadopted.  Over the next few years, a dozen foster children came and went, some staying a day, some two years, some easy, some badly damaged: a 5-year-old who couldn't chew; a 7-year-old who made animal noises; a 10-year-old who wet the bed; an 11-year-old who didn't talk.  Mr. Simard was surprised. ''I didn't know they'd be so bad off,'' he says.  Ms. Simard wasn't. ''It was one of them things I didn't say much about,'' she says.  In August 2000, they got a request to take a 3-month-old boy with bruises on the face and shoulders. ''I never refused a child,'' Ms. Simard says. ''What if somebody didn't take me in?''  By then, Mr. Simard had acclimated. Once he held the baby, Mr. Simard says, ''that little guy wasn't going nowhere.''  ''Jordan,'' says Ms. Simard. He's now 6 and adopted by the Simards. A year later, a 1-week-old arrived. He'd been abandoned at the hospital, says Ms. Simard.  ''Vincent,'' says Mr. Simard. ''Jabber Jaws.'' Mr. Simard wakes for work at 4:30 a.m. -- it's a 90-minute drive to the Hamptons job site -- and Vincent, now 5, gets up in the morning darkness to talk with Daddy.  ''He likes a bowl of Waffle Crisps,'' says Mr. Simard.  In 2002, the Simards took in two more, whom they also adopted, Steven, now 16, and his sister, Ashley, 11. Shortly after Steven arrived, Ms. Simard got a peek at his past. She and her husband were arguing. Later, she said, ''Steven asks me, 'How come you don't hit each other when you argue?' ''  By now, the Simards' two biological children take this life in stride. ''Once they get here, it doesn't feel like a change, just more people,'' says Tom Jr., 22, who lives at home and works with his dad.  ''It's a good thing Steven and Ashley stayed, because I was used to them,'' says Rachael.  The Simards are not the kind who get noticed at school. Rachael, a junior, does not participate in sports or activities. ''I just go to classes and come home,'' she says. But they're a purposeful bunch. She works as a waitress at a catering hall several nights a week, and wants to go to Suffolk Community College to become a veterinary technician. Steven plans to take vocational courses to become an electrician and work with his father. Tom Jr. has a rap group, Akademy, that plays on weekends.  Ms. Simard works three shifts a week as a clinician's assistant at Stony Brook University Medical Center ''to get us health benefits'' and will soon take the test for her real estate license.  The older children helped Mr. Simard add two bedrooms and a bathroom to their house. After dinner, the Simards play board games -- Yahtzee, Scrabble, Cranium, Pictionary.  Vincent, the youngest, probably summed it up best when asked what he likes most about his parents. ''I love my Mommy and I love my Daddy,'' he says. He knows no other.  This is not to say it's easy. Jordan's a loud, aggressive child, and Ms. Simard says even she has trouble handling him. He's been diagnosed with attention deficit and oppositional defiance disorders. They tried to mainstream Jordan, but because of his behavior, he was sent to a special education program. Or as Jabber Jaws put it, ''Jordan was on a big bus, but he spit on it, so they put him on a little bus, littler than mine, and I'm in kindergarten!''  Asked about this, Mr. Simard says, ''To me, Jordan's a normal boy.''  Ms. Simard says she doesn't know if her husband's in denial or putting a positive spin on things for a reporter, but either way, she loves him for it.  PARENTING E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com",

            "fulltext": "Nancy Harris wants to make a few things very clear.  ''I'm not crazy. I'm not stupid,'' Ms. Harris said. ''I just want to work. I'm used to working.''  Not working pulled her into a depression. Not working took her from a steady salary to unemployment compensation and eventually to public assistance. Not working left her with no means to pay her share of her son's college tuition.  Ms. Harris, 51, has been unemployed for more than a year. Losing her job, she said, has been devastating.  Ms. Harris remembers exactly when she was hired as a member of the housekeeping staff at Harlem Hospital Center: Nov. 21, 1998. She valued her work. ''I got to learn a lot about how to care for the sickly, and for the public, and to sanitize the hospitals,'' she said.  One August night in 2005, she was working the graveyard shift and went to a deli on her break to buy a turkey on a roll. By morning, she had food poisoning.  She was sick for two weeks. ''It got worse and worse,'' she said. ''I was walking around here like a dog. I couldn't stand up.''  Ms. Harris was reluctant to ask for help from her son, Alphonso Howlett, 21, who was away at college. ''He's in school. He's getting an education. I don't need him to be distracted,'' she said.  A neighbor insisted that she go to the hospital, and it was determined that she had appendicitis.  The appendix was so inflamed that treatment required two operations, one to drain it and a second in September to remove it. She was at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center for nearly a month. She still has a deep curving scar on her lower right abdomen from her surgery.  Ms. Harris said that on Nov. 18, 2005, she was fired from her job for reasons that she still struggles to understand. ''The only thing that I could see was that I was sick,'' she said. She missed a lot of work and said the union did not take up her case.  She had used her $29,557 yearly salary to put her daughter, Antastasia Nicole Harris, through a training program in the nursing field.  Without a job, she said she was worried that she would not be able to do the same for her son. ''I thought that my son would be terminated at the end of the semester,'' she said.  Ms. Harris's son is a junior at Green Mountain College in Vermont, where he plays on the basketball team and majors in sports management. ''I played basketball all my life, so that's something that I want to do -- being in sports,'' Mr. Howlett said.  Tuition at the Vermont college is $32,000 a year, paid with financial aid, grants, student loans and work study. ''Mine just goes to tuition,'' said Mr. Howlett of his work-study income.  The family also pays $500 each month. When he graduates in May 2008, he will be the first in his family to earn a bachelor's degree.  While Mr. Howlett was gaining a footing with his college life in Vermont, Ms. Harris said she felt like she was losing her ground in New York.  ''I gave up hope when I was on unemployment,'' Ms. Harris said. ''I was in that state of mind because I was hurt.''  Depression made looking for work difficult. ''I've been depressed like this ever since they terminated me,'' she said.  In September, Ms. Harris applied for and began receiving public assistance of $100 a month and $198 a month in food stamps. Her rent in public housing was lowered to $143 a month after she qualified for public assistance.  She was referred to the Work Experience Program run through Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. There, Ms. Harris met Diana Rivera, a case manager, who has helped Ms. Harris turn the corner. ''When I first got there I was looking out the window, crying, crying, crying,'' Ms. Harris said.  Ms. Rivera said she took a particular interest in Ms. Harris's case.  ''I was so compelled by her story,'' Ms. Rivera said. ''The world was pulled from under her feet.'' Ms. Rivera helped Ms. Harris get therapy, acquire interview clothes and seek out food pantries.  And they talked. ''Dee Dee is gorgeous. She's a beautiful person,'' Ms. Harris said of Ms. Rivera.  The agency used $500 in Neediest Cases money to cover Ms. Harris's portion of Mr. Howlett's January tuition. ''It means a lot. I appreciate it, and it really, really, helped my family,'' she said.  Ms. Harris is currently in a 90-day work program with the New York City Transit. ''I love it. We clean train stations,'' she said.  With Ms. Rivera's help she has put together a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and references and is ready to search for a permanent position. She has begun to attend job fairs. She feels stronger. ''That's why I want to go back to work,'' she said. ''I want to stay in maintenance or housekeeping. That's my field; I feel comfortable in that.''

            "fulltext": "''Blood'' is spray painted over the front door of the apartment building where Patricia Barnes's family lives. It appears again and again on the walls of the stairwell leading to their second-floor apartment.  Ms. Barnes, 38, is raising two teenagers in the tough East New York neighborhood in Brooklyn, and she is doing everything she can to keep them off these streets.  About five years ago, she sent her four younger children, now ages 11 to 13, to live with their father's extended family in Ivory Coast, where she believed they would be safer.  ''I think that is the best decision I made,'' said Ms. Barnes, who calls Ivory Coast to speak with her children two or three times a week. ''The way things are running around out here nowadays, I don't want them out here. I don't want him out here.''  By ''him,'' Ms. Barnes meant her son Raymond, 14, who is a high school freshman. Her daughter Chaka Ward, 17, who prefers to be called Tisha, is a sophomore.  Ms. Barnes said she began seeing worrisome changes in Raymond when he was in junior high school.  ''He was doing pretty good in school, and then, I don't know,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''It's like he woke up and he just, 'I don't want to do it no more.' ''  Raymond agreed. ''I was a loose cannon,'' he said, adding that he was ''running wild.''  He was skipping school, outside at all hours, quick-tempered and willing to fight. Such behavior would be frustrating for any parent, but for Ms. Barnes, who sometimes hears gunfire from her window, it was frightening. She waited up for him at night. She worried that despite his youth, Raymond's height -- at 14 he is already 6-foot-3 -- might get him in adult-sized trouble.  ''It felt like my whole world was crumbling,'' she said. ''I was losing control of him, and that's the one thing I felt should never, ever happen.''  Ms. Barnes took any help she could find, including a warning from Raymond's basketball coach that bad behavior would keep him on the bench.  ''She slowed me down, started making me think,'' Raymond said about his coach. ''I really wanted to be on the team. So I started calming down, letting a lot of things slide.''  But Raymond's behavior did not change overnight. An altercation at school led to more absences, and in December 2005, Ms. Barnes applied for a Person In Need of Supervision petition. The petition would give Family Court the power to force Raymond to attend school.  Rather than grant the petition, the court referred the family for counseling at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  They began attending counseling sessions in February at the bureau's East New York Family Center. Ms. Barnes goes weekly, and Tisha and Raymond accompany her monthly.  After 10 months of counseling, changes are evident in Ms. Barnes's life. She is training for a new job and earned her G.E.D. last month.  Ms. Barnes had worked as a home health aide for years, but it was unstable income, and she relied on public assistance to make ends meet.  In October, Ms. Barnes started a job training program through public assistance. She works for the Parks Department, cleaning city parks. She describes the program as ''giving you your responsibility: to be a part of the working class,'' she said, ''which is a beautiful thing, because I love it.''  She earns about $320 a week and receives $115 in food stamps each month. Her share of the rent for her subsidized four-bedroom apartment is $150 a month. Her job training program ends in March, and she hopes to be hired permanently.  Ms. Barnes said she cherished the time she spent with her oldest children studying for the G.E.D. exam. Tisha helped her with language, and Raymond studied algebra with her.  ''He actually took a genuine interest in it,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''It was so amazing for us to just lay across the bed and just talk about it.''  ''I'm proud of my accomplishments,'' she said. ''Your kids have something to look up to.''  Cascille Andela, a social worker who counsels the family, said she had seen a big change in Ms. Barnes's ability to cope with adversity.  ''She is able to come home and be more relaxed, understanding, and trying to work though problems rather than getting frustrated and throwing her hands up,'' Ms. Andela said.  After a home visit in which she noticed that Raymond and Ms. Barnes were both sleeping in the living room, Ms. Andela used $965 from the Neediest Cases to replace the family's worn mattresses.  ''You've got to have a bed to sleep in,'' Ms. Andela said. ''You can't go to work the next morning if you can't get to sleep at night.''  Ms. Barnes hopes that her children will draw inspiration from her efforts. In December, Tisha started her first job, working at a day care center. ''I don't care where she worked as long as the little girl knows it's going to feel good to get a paycheck,'' Ms. Barnes said.  As for Raymond, he is getting in fewer fights, and is working at grade level for the first time after eight years in special education classes, where he had been placed because of his behavior. He grudgingly admits this year's schoolwork is a little more interesting. Ms. Barnes and Ms. Andela are still working on persuading him to attend school regularly, but he is no longer roaming the streets.  Bit by bit, Ms. Barnes and her family seem to be gaining ground.  ''I've made it my business to not let anything stop me from achieving my goals,'' she said.

            "fulltext": "ON the surface, it seemed like the perfectly executed job search. Every day, a 40-year-old saleswoman based in New York would scan Internet job boards like Monster, HotJobs and CareerBuilder and would send e-mail messages to contacts and potential employers. She faxed her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and checked online trade news. In short, she did everything she could to find a more fulfilling job than the one she had held for seven years.  There was just one catch: she conducted much of her job search last year right under her employer's nose, using the company's computer, fax machine, business e-mail account and office supplies.  ''I was doing a lot of stuff that could have gotten me in trouble,'' acknowledged the saleswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was still working for the same small business. ''My opinion was, let them fire me. I would have been disappointed to hurt their feelings, but on the other hand I had to do what I had to do.'' She did erase her computer's history as often as possible to cover her tracks.  Her story is not unusual. In workplaces where high-speed broadband Internet access is typically available and 60-hour workweeks are commonplace, many employees believe that the office is the most convenient or effective place to do a job search. And people who are unhappy with their jobs sometimes believe that they are entitled to use the workplace to find something better.  There are no statistics on the extent of the practice, but according to workplace experts and employees, it is widespread. The problem is that such activity is often against company policy and may even lead to dismissal.  ''It's something that should be avoided, particularly when company employment policies specifically forbid resources and communication devices for any personal use, much less for a job search,'' said Ben Dattner, principal of Dattner Consulting, a Manhattan-based firm with large and small corporate and nonprofit clients. ''It's important to abide by the terms of one's employment and not to burn bridges.''  The chances of being caught, Mr. Dattner added, have climbed as more companies monitor computer use and e-mail. He said that instead of using company time and property for a job search, employees could conduct the hunt on their own time with their home computers and cellphones. And it is not difficult to go to a nearby print center at lunchtime to make copies, he noted.  Noah Pickus, interim director for ethics at the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University, recommends that job seekers use common sense in their pursuit of new employment while at the office. That means not spending hours job-searching while neglecting work duties or putting the office phone number on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.  ''There is an important distinction between an occasional e-mail and spending half a day looking for another job,'' Mr. Pickus said. ''The most difficult ethical dilemmas are often between two rights. It's right to look out for yourself and your family and it's right that you have an obligation to your current employer.''  John A. Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement firm based in Chicago, says that most employees, especially those under 40, see themselves as ''free agents'' who will search for jobs from their offices as a matter of course. Employees working 50- or 60-hour weeks, he said, are often too exhausted to look for jobs when they are outside the office.  He says he does believe that job-hunting from the office crosses an ethical line when employees begin using office supplies for r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters.  It can also be dangerous. Mr. Challenger suggested that if an employer caught an employee job-searching on company time, it could lead to a loss of ''plum assignments and promotions.''  An organization that is downsizing may be quicker to fire an employee who has been caught faxing his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and occasionally it may lead to dismissal of a worker who is already on thin ice, Mr. Challenger said. Occasionally, though, it could have the opposite effect, he said -- spurring an employer to try to reconcile differences with a disgruntled but valuable employee.  There is one situation when it may be acceptable to look for a job from the office, Mr. Challenger said: when layoffs are expected or have been announced.  That was the case for Adrienne Lewin, 34, now a freelance writer based in New Jersey who was a staff reporter for FoxNews.com in 2001, when the company announced major layoffs. Many of the employees to be laid off, including Ms. Lewin, remained in the company's offices in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan for about two months after the announcements and took advantage of the opportunity to use FoxNews.com resources to find another job, she said.  ''I searched job sites from the office,'' Ms. Lewin said. ''I also used the fax machine printer, copier and phone to reach journalism contacts and respond to job postings. And there was a small amount of satisfaction in using whatever I could from the employer who was letting me go, to find something better.''  MS. LEWIN said she would be too nervous about getting caught to use company computers or e-mail to hunt for jobs from the office again. But she has seen it done often at other jobs she has held.  ''I've found job listings and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s resting on printers at work,'' Ms. Lewin said. ''Though I haven't done it, I think people treat it like shopping online during work hours. It's not seen as an ethical violation.''  A 52-year-old hospital health care professional based in New York says she was initially torn about searching for new work from the office of an employer she has been with for 12 years. On one hand, she said, she occasionally felt guilty job-hunting from her office at lunch hour or using moments to update her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and to check online job boards.  On the other hand, she said the qualms she felt about looking for a new job while at work were superseded by anger toward her employers for making her feel ''anonymous and replaceable.'' She believes that her talent and master's-level education are not being utilized in her current job, she said, and that the two hours a week she spends job-hunting from the office does not affect her work.  While she is comfortable using her office computer to job-search, she said, she does not feel right sending e-mail messages to prospective employers.  Just as job-seeking from the office often requires secrecy, so can going on interviews. In 2004, Mary Catanzaro realized after just two weeks that an office-manager job she took with a New York-based fashion showroom was a mistake. Almost immediately, she began searching for another job and going on interviews. But the showroom's dress code was so casual that showing up in a work suit would have looked suspicious.  ''Wearing a blue suit was a red flag that you were interviewing,'' Ms. Catanzaro, now 37, recalled. Instead, she packed her blue suit into her gym bag and changed clothes and applied makeup in a nearby McDonald's restroom.  Ms. Catanzaro, whose current job as an office manager for a New York photography studio includes interviewing prospective employees, said that she empathized with people who look for jobs while at work. ''If you're not happy with a place, you don't care about protocol,'' she said. ''You're trying to go forward with your own career. It's not necessarily ethical, but it's sometimes necessary.''

She remembered her sister learning to play the piano. And she remembered that it was at Martin Van Buren High School in Queens Village where she fell in love with her first boyfriend. Though the relationship ended, they had a daughter, Twanysha, now 15.  Ms. Bogen said watching her mother, Marie Bogen, slowed down by age and illness was a stark contrast to the happier times they shared when she was younger.  When Ms. Bogen was a child, the holidays, even on her mother's limited budget as an accounts payable clerk in a grocery store, were always festive. ''No matter what, if you were in my mother's home you talked and enjoyed yourself,'' said Ms. Bogen, now 34, in her living room recently.  As diabetes eroded her mother's strength, the bills began to pile up. To pay the bills, Ms. Bogen worked as a consumer service representative at Health Insurance Plan of New York, and later at Bell Atlantic, which became Verizon. ''I just worked to support my mom, help with rent, groceries and bills,'' she said.  Ms. Bogen also helped her sister, Sonia Fryer, financially. Ms. Fryer has Crohn's disease and was also recovering from radiation treatment for a brain tumor.  Following her mother's example, Ms. Bogen said she was unequivocal when it came to family matters. ''Family comes first; material things are not important,'' she said.  In the last year of her mother's life, Ms. Bogen was happy to see her mother spend time with her grandson, Amir, who was born in May 2001. Twanysha was especially close to her grandmother, and insisted on sleeping in her bed. She was in the bedroom when her grandmother died on Nov. 23, 2001.  After her mother's death, Ms. Bogen took over the expenses and the apartment and was further strained financially. She scraped together $6,000 through a loan, her 401(k) plan, and family and friends to pay for her mother's funeral expenses.  In 2003, she left Verizon, taking a voluntary severance package, which she used to finish her bachelor's degree in business administration at Metropolitan College of New York. With the degree, she thought she would have a better chance of earning a higher salary. But even after she graduated, she could only find full-time work without benefits.  By 2005, her rent increased to $940 from $839 a month. She was working on Long Island in the customer service department at Health Care Partners, earning $15 an hour. The commuting and the stress began to wear her down. She was hospitalized in December 2005 for severe migraines, she said.  In the spring of 2006, her rent was increased again, this time to $1,053.49. It could not have happened at a worse time. She was fired from her job, and her daughter was acting out at school. Twanysha was in therapy for four months to work through severe depression and feelings of abandonment from her father and grandmother. ''All she understands is that people were in her life and now they are not,'' Ms. Bogen said.  ''I felt that I was not doing my job as a parent,'' Ms. Bogen added. ''You are doing so much and your plate is overfull, but you're trying to accommodate their needs.''  When rent was due in May 2006, Ms. Bogen was short. ''I had to fight to maintain a roof over their head; she needed stability,'' Ms. Bogen said of her daughter. ''I definitely didn't want to go into the shelter.''  While trying to find work, she received $164 a week from unemployment, which barely covered the cost of food, much less rent. She turned off her cellphone and posted a notice in the laundry room of her building to sell her love seat, sofa and television.  ''Nobody was calling me for jobs, I didn't have food stamps,'' she said. ''I was desperate.'' She sold the furnishings for $1,850, she said, which was about a third of what she had paid for them.  Trying to head off eviction, she went to a housing court in Queens in July 2006. There she received a number for the Community Service Society of New York, which is one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Anna Auleley, a caseworker at the agency, returned her call and said she could help as soon as Ms. Bogen found a job, to ensure that she could pay rent the next month.  By September 2006, she owed $5,485.32. ''My management company would not let me pay a partial amount; I had to pay in full,'' she said. Before time ran out, she found a data entry job in New Jersey making $15 an hour. To pay the outstanding amount, Ms. Auleley drew $1,581.83 from Neediest Cases and received $1,053.49 from FEMA. Ms. Bogen covered the rest with her savings.  ''It was a big load off my shoulders,'' Ms. Bogen said with a sigh of relief.  Ms. Bogen now works temporarily in data processing for Fidelis Care in Queens, making $13 an hour. And she is sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, seeking an administrative position.  Now in her apartment, beside the piano her sister used to play (one of the few things she did not sell), is a worn sofa and love seat given to her by a neighbor.  ''I wasn't going to say no,'' she said, referring to the offer for the furniture. ''For today, this is how we get by.''

            "fulltext": "Stephanie Robinson Davis and Randy Davis are young parents just starting out. There can be a lot to learn, but in the Davises' house, they already know that their children come first.  ''I try my best to give them everything I didn't have,'' said Mr. Davis, 27. ''I want them to have a stable home. I never really had a stable home because I was in and out of foster care.''  Nyliyah, 2, danced around the coffee table. ''Me comfortable,'' she said in a singsong voice.  Ms. Davis, 26, laughed at her daughter's energy, saying, ''It's got to be the Froot Loops.''  The couple's other child, Shymell, 4, named for his quiet nature, even as a baby, watched the action from one corner of the immaculate living room, which Ms. Davis had carefully decorated and scrubbed to a shine.  As children, Mr. and Ms. Davis both spent years in foster care. Their cheerful home is proof of the new path they are making for their own children. The road has not always been easy.  Mr. Davis was born in 1980. He said drugs were booming then, and ''my mother, she was really on it hard.'' He was raised mostly by his grandmother, who died when he was 11. He was then placed in a foster home in the Bronx.  Meanwhile, Ms. Davis landed in foster care herself as her mother battled her own addictions and abusive relationships. Still, throughout the nearly 12 years that she was in foster care, her mother fought to stay in her life. ''My mother always made sure that we was close, always,'' Ms. Davis said.  She is the oldest of eight children and fiercely protective of her siblings. ''I know what it's like to be a mother. It's easy to take care of my children because I know what it's like to be a mother since a very young age,'' she said.  Throughout their tumultuous childhoods, both of the Davises found an adult they could count on: Jean Marie De Veaux, education coordinator at the Family Foster Care program of the Children's Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  ''I've been knowing her since I was a itty-bitty little person,'' Ms. Davis said. Ms. De Veaux provided information about schools, scholarships, jobs and bill-paying. Anything the Davises needed to know, they went to Ms. De Veaux.  Mr. Davis said: ''If I needed help, she was there for me. I love Miss Jean Marie De Veaux.''  The couple met as young adults at a day care center where they were both working in jobs they got through the Children's Aid Society. Ms. Davis had been hired full time after completing an internship, and Mr. Davis was working there during breaks from college at Norfolk State University in Virginia.  In May 2002, Mr. Davis left school about a semester short of graduation. Ms. Davis was pregnant with Shymell, and Mr. Davis would not think of her going through pregnancy alone, nor of his child's life beginning without him. Mr. Davis hopes to complete his degree and says he misses college. ''I wanted to be a social worker; that's what I majored in,'' he said.  Mr. Davis ended up working in construction, even though the income was quite unstable and he found the work unsatisfying. Ms. Davis was a seasonal Parks Department employee.  Their lives became even more of a struggle one day in March when Ms. Davis's mother died suddenly from a heart problem. Ms. Davis took on more family responsibility. Her savings went to cover funeral costs and to help provide for her younger siblings.  Her 3-year-old brother, Malikk, is of the greatest concern. She is helping her oldest brother care for him now. ''We all have to decide what we're going to do right now to keep this family together,'' Ms. Davis said. Her brother Alfred Robinson, 19, also sometimes lives with the Davises.  ''I wouldn't trade it in for a minute, because they all give me some type of support,'' she said.  Ms. Davis's job came to an end for the season in March, coincidentally on the day her mother died. The aftermath has derailed her search for a new job.  The Davises receive $345 in food stamps each month and $119.50 in public assistance. The $184 rent on their two-bedroom apartment in Harlem is covered by public assistance.  By the fall, construction work for Mr. Davis had slowed and the family was struggling to keep up. They turned to Ms. De Veaux for help. She used $605.59 in Neediest Cases money: $300 for clothing vouchers for the children, $152 for two monthly MetroCards for continuing job searches and $153.59 toward part of a phone bill.  The Children's Aid Society also helped with employment. On Nov. 14, Mr. Davis started working part time at the organization's P.S. 8 Community Schools program. ''I love it. I love working with kids,'' he said. He hopes to do more. ''If they put me full time, I'd jump and touch the sky.''  With a little help from Neediest Cases, and continuing help from Ms. De Veaux, the Davises are making it.  Ms. De Veaux said, ''When they had each of their babies, I watched them trying to recreate the love and stability that they missed out on, in part. This is such a success story, I think, from foster care because they've been through a lot.  ''This is what marriage is. This is what commitment is. It's not what you see in the movies.''

            "fulltext": "Coming home from their respective tours of duty in Iraq, John Reid and Alina Gutierrez had never met but they had a lot in common. Both were sergeants in the 42nd Infantry Division of the Army and were deployed in Iraq from autumn 2004 to autumn 2005. And both had a strong interest in running their own businesses when they got home.  Ms. Gutierrez is an owner of a Glass Doctor franchise, and next month, Mr. Reid will open his own Glass Doctor in a neighboring New Jersey county. They are the beneficiaries of an innovative private-sector business plan aimed at encouraging and supporting military veterans.  The Veterans Transition Franchise Initiative, or VetFran, a program sponsored by the International Franchise Association, offers veterans a discount on financing prospective franchises as a way of thanking them for serving the country.  Nearly 200 participating franchise companies provide qualified veterans ''the best deal'' in acquiring a new franchise, a deal not available to other franchise investors, according to Dina Dwyer-Owens, president of the Dwyer Group, a franchise organization in Waco, Tex.  Franchises have become an increasingly appealing route for many would-be entrepreneurs. According to a 2004 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, franchise businesses employ more than 18 million Americans and generate more than $1.5 trillion, or nearly 10 percent of private-sector economic output. The study noted that there were more than 760,000 franchise businesses in the United States and franchising continues to be a fast-growing business opportunity.  VetFran was conceived by Don Dwyer Sr., Ms. Dwyer-Owens' father, after the Persian Gulf war. When Mr. Dwyer died suddenly in 1994, the VetFran program foundered. After 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan, Ms. Dwyer-Owens decided that the program ought to be revived and, in 2002, she turned it over to the franchise association.  VetFran is open to all veterans, not just those returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. Since the program began, more than 600 veterans have received discounts in starting franchise businesses. Among the participating franchise companies are Dunkin' Donuts, Midas, the UPS Store, Gold's Gym and Aamco Transmissions.  Ms. Gutierrez, 26, said she received a 10 percent discount on her Glass Doctor franchise fee, which saved her several thousand dollars in much-needed capital for her outlet in Mercer County. But as with Mr. Reid and other veterans who have participated in the VetFran program, the money was not as significant as the meaning of the gesture.  ''I was very excited when I heard about the program,'' Ms. Gutierrez said. ''When you come home from your deployment, you are not sure if everyone appreciated what you had done. I thought it was very cool that they recognized that we risked our lives in Iraq and they appreciated our sacrifice.''  Mr. Reid, who views Ms. Gutierrez as a colleague, not a competitor, said that the VetFran discount was a big influence on his decision to pursue a Glass Doctor franchise. ''The less capital you have to lay out, the better,'' he said. ''You need as much start-up money as you can get.''  He was also impressed that Glass Doctor, one of eight franchise businesses owned and operated by the Dwyer Group, was willing to be flexible with his deal, offering him an additional four months before he has to start repayments.  Because of their military training, returning veterans are highly regarded as prospective franchise operators by franchise companies. As with the military, successful franchises operate within a specific system and a set of guidelines, created by the franchiser.  ''Someone coming back from the military is a great fit for a franchise business,'' said Jim Blasingame, a small-business consultant and host of the ''The Small Business Advocate Show'' on radio. ''They not only know what it's like to work hard but they know how to operate within a system. With a franchise, you can't think outside the box. You have to color inside the lines.''  The military is apparently good training for all types of entrepreneurs. According to William D. Elmore, associate administrator for veterans business development at the Small Business Administration, there are 25 million veterans in the United States and one in seven of them is successfully self-employed.  ''Veterans have the highest rate of successful self-employment of any group of Americans,'' Mr. Elmore said, noting the 14 percent success rate in self-employment. He attributes this success to the discipline and training every soldier acquires during their service. ''There is an enormous resource going into the training and deployment of soldiers and out of that comes a skill set, discipline and worldliness that most citizens don't have at a young age.''  Mr. Reid, 40, says that Iraq gave him an opportunity to save $60,000 while he was deployed and he was intent on using that money to set up his own business. ''As a noncommissioned officer in charge of a logistics section, I was responsible for 45 people,'' he said. All 45 came back. ''So I thought, 'Let's see how I do in business.' ''  His Glass Doctor franchise in Somerset, N.J., which is set to open Feb. 5, gives him exclusive rights to all of Somerset County. ''They told me, 'We have a system. If you follow it, you'll be successful.' That sounded like the business for me,'' he said.  The VetFran program is allowing Brett Cooper to start a Lawn Doctor franchise in Boonville, Mo., while keeping his full-time job as a sales representative for Graybar Electric. As an 18-year member of the Missouri Army National Guard, Mr. Cooper was called up for a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2004 and spent a year deployed in and around Kabul.  ''I looked into a Lawn Doctor franchise six years ago, but I wasn't financially able to do it,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''While I was in Afghanistan, I saved my salary. I'm a major so the pay was very good. and it gave me a cushion. I e-mailed Lawn Doctor from Afghanistan and was made aware of the VetFran program.''  He received a 5 percent discount on his start-up costs for the franchises, which is significant given that Lawn Doctor franchises cost $90,000.  As with other veterans starting franchises, Mr. Cooper does not hesitate to let customers know he is a veteran. ''I've absolutely used my veteran status,'' he said. ''People are very grateful that you have served your country, especially in the current conflict. Doing that kind of service for your country builds trust and respect.''  Ms. Dwyer-Owens is pleased by the response to the VetFran program thus far. ''The veterans are so grateful that we are there to say thanks,'' she said. ''I'm proud of it. There's no government funding. It's all done by private businesses.''  Mr. Elmore praised the VetFran program as a strong private-sector initiative that opened doors for veterans seeking small-business opportunities. He also cautioned that veterans should seek expert advice available through S.B.A. business development centers before signing any agreements (www.sba.gov/vets).  Jerry Pyle, a retired Marine sergeant in Mineola, Fla., is among those who appreciate the VetFran gesture. After a 22-year career in the Marines ended in 1999, Mr. Pyle tried his hand in corporate retail and found himself ill suited to that atmosphere. He began his own business as a handyman and home remodeler and when he moved from South Carolina to central Florida, he heard about the Dream Maker Bath and Kitchen Worldwide franchise, another Dwyer Group company.  ''It resonated with me that a corporation would actually take my service to the country into consideration,'' he said. ''It felt like a belated payback for 22 years of service.''  The VetFran program emphasizes that veterans not only make excellent franchisers but employees as well. Mr. Pyle said that he gravitated toward the qualities and values of veterans and all of his five full-time employees are either veterans or wives of veterans. ''Their qualities of teamwork, ethics and enthusiasm make us a better company,'' he said.  SMALL BUSINESS",

Leithauser suggests that the gods control the world of the Aeneid and that ''relatively little malice and unreasonableness and rapacity seem innate to our kind.'' Yet Virgil has one of his characters in Book 9 question whether his internal lust for war is prompted by the gods or whether people simply deify their own desires. Virgil's epic is full of these hints that Aeneas' god-given mission might be prompted by his own deified desires and that the epic gods are an allegorical, literary device. In addition, Leithauser states that ''Virgil was wrong'' to suggest that Rome's glory ''will never fade,'' but it's Virgil's characters who suggest this -- not Virgil. As Edward Rothstein put it in a recent New York Times column: ''The argument has been made that Virgil's project was actually ironic, anti-Augustan: he showed how civilization itself is drenched in blood, with self-celebratory history being written by the victors.''

Richardson's biography of William James discussed the same issue as one of the assigned paper topics: Compare Pascal's wager with James's will to believe.  Goldstein properly points to some similarities, but there is a major difference. If you win Pascal's wager you win salvation; if you win James's bet you gain something more suitable to a philosopher: new evidence. For some people the world looks entirely different after taking an art class than it did before. They see the same material objects; but everything takes on a different meaning. James is raising the possibility that the same is true for a spiritual universe. Before the leap the universe is solely material; afterward, thanks to our openness, we see the same universe as invested with religious meaning. James, the perfect amalgamation of religious and scientific temperaments, tried his entire life to make this leap, but was never satisfied with the evidence he saw.  Steven B.

Concerned to highlight the connection between James's personal experience and his philosophical views, she describes James as a ''deeply divided man'' because he wasted much time trying to decide what profession to pursue. She then claims that he defined the divided self as a ''technical term in psychology,'' implying that it means merely a self struggling to make a decision.  The fact is that the divided self is for James an essentially religious concept describing the inner turmoil and division so well expressed by the anguished words of St. Paul -- ''The good I would, I do not, and that I would not, that I do, O wretched man that I am.'' James rightly saw this as the confession of human sin, the conflict between the self that knows what ought to be done and the same self acknowledging its inability to do it. That the divided self had basically religious significance for James is shown in two of his other examples -- St. Augustine and John Bunyan -- each of whom has left us vivid accounts of his own grappling with the divided self that defines the human predicament in biblical religion.

This, he claims, sounds ''more like Augie March than someone from the old country,'' and he ''wonders'' about what Singer may have thought.  It is surely relevant to note that Bellow's English is a close and direct translation of Singer's Yiddish. The fact is that Yiddish speakers in the ''old country'' had plenty of words for fool, and presumably many occasions to use them. Singer's seven examples, each well rendered by Bellow, far from exhausted the storehouse. If you look in Nahum Stutchkoff's Yiddish thesaurus of 1950, published by YIVO, you will find 11 dense columns under the heading ''narishkayt.''  Paul Needham  Summit, N.J.",

            "fulltext": "A TALE OF TWO LIONS  By Roberto Ransom.  Translated by Jasper Reid.  Illustrated. 114 pp.  W. W. Norton & Company. $19.95.  There are all sorts of books about lions. Accounts of lions who come to stay are always popular, as Joy Adamson discovered when she wrote ''Born Free'' and its sequels. These books succeed because the idea of sharing one's life with such a creature is, at some deep level, very appealing. Then there is writing in which lion imagery is used to make a point about the human rather than the leonine situation. In such a context, the lion is symbolic of vigor, of the masculine, of the untamable. Indeed, so burdened are lions with symbolism that it's surprising they manage to stagger even a few paces, let alone spring at their prey.  I came to ''A Tale of Two Lions,'' by the Mexican writer Roberto Ransom (translated by Jasper Reid, son of the well-known Scottish essayist and translator Alastair Reid), in a mood of enthusiastic anticipation, being well-disposed toward lions and their literary depiction. Ever since I read Russell Hoban's remarkable ''Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz'' some years ago, I have been looking for another piece of leonine magic realism.  Lion books need not be long, but they do need meat. And while Ransom's book is charming, it is perhaps a bit too brief to explore its theme of lions lost and found. Two main stories are brought together, to an extent, in a third, but ''A Tale of Two Lions'' is really just one long short story, or a shortish novella. The Thurberesque drawings that punctuate the book don't add a great deal to a story that, on its own, is perfectly engaging. There might also have been fewer pages of preliminaries, one of which bears a single sentence reminding us of the line used in old maps to fill unknown spaces: ''Here there are lions.'' (Perhaps this is a warning about the virtually blank pages we'll encounter later on?)  The first story takes the epistolary form and concerns a lion -- small enough to pass for a cat, but leonine in its exuberant habits -- that travels in an aircraft from Italy to the United States and then goes missing. In the next story, we are in a museum where a lion on display suddenly leaps out of an exhibit. (This is a lovely idea, and the relationship between the museum attendant and the lion is poignantly described.) Finally, we find ourselves in a circus, where the two lions meet. The first lion, Cattino, speaks Italian (a nice conceit), but all too soon both animals disappear. We are left wondering just who was who.  It's all very whimsical, but that, of course, is what a picaresque novel can be. Ransom's lions are elusive, and deliberately so: we see them, and then they appear to be something else; they are gone, yet they are somehow within us. It's like a half-remembered dream -- or an unexpected sighting of a real lion in the bush.  Alexander McCall Smith's most recent novel is ''The Right Attitude to Rain.''",

            "fulltext": "IN\u00c9S OF MY SOUL  By Isabel Allende.  Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden.  Illustrated. 321 pp.  HarperCollins Publishers. $25.95.  A work of historical fiction couldn't ask for better bones than the adventures of a real-life conquistadora. The heroine of Isabel Allende's latest book, a 16th-century Spanish woman who sailed to Peru and trekked south with the expedition that claimed vast lands for Charles V, faces the same perils as the soldiers around her -- along with a few extras, like unwanted sexual advances.  Not that In\u00e9s Su\u00e1rez rejects them all: Pedro de Valdivia, the leader of the expedition, is her lover and partner in the founding of Santiago de la Nueva Extremadura, the first Spanish stronghold in Chile. This conquistador, whose wife initially remained in Spain, regularly seeks his lover's counsel. ''I did not have enough hours to do everything,'' In\u00e9s, the ultimate multitasker, complains: ''taking care of my house and the colony, looking after the sick, the plantings and the animal pens, along with my reading lessons.''  In Margaret Sayers Peden's translation of ''In\u00e9s of My Soul,'' Allende's reach is broad, scooping up politics, history, romance and the supernatural. ''This novel is a work of intuition, but any similarity to events and persons relating to the conquest of Chile is not coincidental,'' she writes in an author's note. This is a neat twist on a familiar phrase, but it hints at a problem. Too often Allende's book reads as if she is assembling a plot around places, dates and historical figures. Slow to start, the narrative acquires an events-driven tunnel vision that can get in the way of character development.  At a time when the strong arm of the Spanish Inquisition reached clear to the southern tip of the New World, Valdivia's mission was to find riches in Chile while conquering and converting the indigenous population. In Allende's rendering, In\u00e9s has a sensitive view of the local people: ''They are my enemies,'' she notes of the Mapuche Indians, ''but I admire them because I know that if I were in their place, I would die fighting for my land, as they are doing.''  Despite this, In\u00e9s is a crucial actor in the brutality of the Spanish conquest, at one point decapitating prisoners and throwing their heads outside the walls of the fledgling colony. Not terribly conflicted by the part she must play, she seems beyond reproach, as effective and inscrutable in battle as she is as a gobernadora. As if that weren't enough, she has two almost impossibly valuable attributes: she's been born with the gift of dousing, which means she can find water anywhere, and she never becomes pregnant.  Allende uses the backdrop of constant violence to weigh in on the politics of domination and intimidation. Is it just a coincidence that the date given for the biggest, bloodiest battle in Santiago is Sept. 11? Or that, on the very same day in 1973, Salvador Allende (the author's uncle, then the president of Chile) was assassinated and his government overthrown in a military coup? ''I fear that these pages already contain more cruelty than a Christian soul can tolerate,'' In\u00e9s notes. ''In the New World, no one has scruples when the moment calls for violence. But what am I saying? Violence ... exists everywhere, and has throughout the ages. Nothing changes; we humans repeat the same sins over and over, eternally.''  What stays with the reader, after the treks and battles and politics fade, aren't Allende's political musings or even her characters. Instead it's her vivid descriptions of daily life in 16th-century South America: the meager soups that starving settlers season with mice, lizards, crickets and worms; the marriage rituals of the Mapuche, in which a man ''steals the girl he desires''; an attack in which the right hands and noses of Mapuche prisoners are removed with hatchets and knives. In ''In\u00e9s of My Soul,'' Allende succeeds in resurrecting a woman from history and endowing her with the gravitas of a hero. But as a work of fiction, her portrait of In\u00e9s is hit-and-miss.

            "fulltext": "This summer, readers interested in American wealth will be able to pick up Robert Frank's new book -- and the other Robert Frank's new book.  Robert Frank, a reporter who covers private wealth for The Wall Street Journal, and Robert H. Frank, an economist and professor at Cornell University (who also contributes to The New York Times), have both written books dealing with the culture of wealth in the United States. Mr. Frank's ''Richistan: A Journey Through the American Wealth Boom and the Lives of the New Rich,'' will be published by Random House's Crown imprint in June, while Professor Frank's ''Falling Behind: How Rising Inequality Harms the Middle Class,'' will be published by the University of California Press in July.  Both writers, who are telephone acquaintances, sounded more amused than annoyed by the coincidental timing. ''If Robert Frank comes out with a book on economic inequality, it's going to be confusing,'' said Professor Frank, who said that people occasionally mistake him for the journalist. But, he added, the other Robert Frank ''is entitled to his name and any subject he wants to write about.''  Mr. Frank's regard for the professor goes beyond just his name. ''I'm a huge admirer of his work. I've read and loved every book that he's written,'' he said. ''He's a renowned and respected and highly trained economist, and I'm a mere journalist.''  The writers also rely on small distinctions to separate their public identities. ''I use my middle initial, so this helps,'' said Professor Frank, who has some experience sharing his name. (His literary agent also represents the photographer named, yes, Robert Frank.)  The journalist Mr. Frank, whose longtime byline is ''Robert Frank'' and whose middle initial is L., had considered using that initial with ''Richistan'' (early copies of the book's jacket have it). But he has now decided to publish the book without the initial, he said Friday. Both men also said that their books, while superficially related, were very different in tone and purpose. Mr. Frank described ''Richistan'' as a ''colorful and fun'' collection of stories about the lives and lifestyles of wealthy Americans. ''Falling Behind'' examines the pressures facing middle-class Americans as a result of uneven income gains.  Professor Frank's book already has its first endorsement -- from Mr. Frank, who has read a manuscript copy. ''I think his book is great and I hope people buy it,'' Mr. Frank said.

Although the general store's space is ample, there are just 24 seats for eating-in. They are often full, with people munching savory or sweet crepes, house-made scones, sandwiches and other goodies made by four full-time chefs.  Available daily are four savory buckwheat crepes (a popular favorite is the wild mushroom with blue cheese) and six sweet ones (with banana-and-chocolate a crowd-pleaser). The fresh-made scones are another big hit, with different ones offered each day (try the peach-and-ginger or maple walnut if they're on the menu).  Among many popular sandwiches are the Southwest (turkey, bacon, avocado, Cheddar and chipotle mayonnaise on a ciabatta roll), ham and Brie (with green apples, honey mustard and tomato on multigrain bread) and the Mekong sub (pickled daikon radish, cucumber, fresh cilantro and five-spice sausage on a baguette). Simon's baguettes, made with butter and Portuguese sea salt, are another reason to make this a stop.  Owned for the last two and a half years by Jim and Jody Reilly, Simon's also produces many delicious dishes to go, including shepherd's pie, sausage-and-lentil stew and stuffed eggplant.

            "fulltext": "THE pigs, cows and fowl being raised on Footsteps Farm in Old Mystic are treated well -- very well. The owner, Craig Floyd, names every one and allows them all to live in a way he insists they deserve: plenty of fresh air, sunshine and interaction with members of their breeds.  After all, he says, animals raised for consumption deserve such high-quality treatment because they will be making the ultimate sacrifice for humans.  This philosophy, along with his refusal to use herbicides, antibiotics or other chemicals in raising the animals, helped Footsteps Farm become the first farm in Connecticut to receive a ''Certified Humane Raised and Handled'' designation from Humane Farm Animal Care, a nonprofit organization based in Virginia that seeks to improve the lives of farm animals.  Farmers say the designation is important because it demonstrates to consumers that a third party has agreed that their animals are being raised in a natural manner. Mr. Floyd said he sought the certification because it was in keeping with his outlook.  ''An organic chicken generally means it was fed organic grain,'' he said. ''It can still mean it was never outside and never had a chicken life.''  He said that while pigs are social animals that have round noses so they can root in the ground, most of those raised for consumption spend their lives alone and confined in windowless, concrete-floored pens.  Fowls are meant to scratch in the earth, but many chickens and turkeys that end up on our plates have had their beaks clipped, he said.  Footsteps Farm is one of 55 food producers nationwide to receive the Certified Humane designation. Holly Bridges, director of outreach for Humane Farm Animal Care, said the program began in May 2003.  Producers with the designation include family farms like Footsteps, packers like Mosner Veal in the Bronx and food marketers. Applegate Farms in Bridgewater, N.J., is the only other suburban New York City food producer with the certification.  Christopher Ely, co-founder of Applegate, said his company concentrates on the sale and distribution of food like cheese, bacon and delicatessen meat.  ''We still micromanage our production,'' he said while on his way to inspect a Pennsylvania farm from which Applegate buys turkeys.  Footsteps received certification in November for its chickens and turkeys, one of which was bought by Martha Stewart for Thanksgiving. Mr. Floyd said he expected that his pigs would also soon be certified.  Besides being free to roam in their paddocks and mingle with one another, his small herd of red-colored Tamworth pigs are the same breed that his ancestors might have raised when they began working the land in 1712, he said.  He specializes in heritage breeds that are becoming endangered as food producers genetically engineer animals to grow bigger and faster, he said. Many big food producers have genetically altered pigs that grow to market weight in six months, while his pigs take 10 to 12 months to reach optimal size, he said.  Not only does he want to help preserve endangered breeds like the Tamworth pigs, Bourbon Red turkeys and Highland cattle, but he also wants animals that are more genetically natural, he said.  In the end, Mr. Floyd said, everyone benefits.  ''If a pig is happy, it affects the taste of the meat,'' he said.  FARMING",

Although many of the classic sweets sold here are made from a short list of ingredients -- mainly milk -- the resulting variety of good things to taste is astounding.  The sweets at Bengali Sweet House represent various regions of India, but to try some of the best, order those typical of Bengal, which is known for its confections. The mix includes cheeselike sandesh, rosogolla treats that ooze milk, and creamy white and pink cham-cham, shaped like cumulus clouds. The beautiful yellow hue of the aam sandesh signals its mango flavor. It tastes as good as it looks. All these sweets are $9 a pound.  Ghee, or clarified butter, and mawa, or dried condensed milk, are two essential ingredients in Indian sweets, and Bengali Sweet House makes both in house. The homemade quality is evident, especially in the gulab jaman, milk balls fried in ghee with cardamom, and in the fudgelike burfi (an assortment, $8 a pound). There are chocolate, coconut and pistachio burfi ($7 to $8 a pound). The dried fruit sweets, including the badam pista roll with almonds and pistachio, are also good ($9 a pound).  Aside from sweets, Bengali Sweet House also sells a variety of chaat, or Indian snacks, including fresh fried samosas, filled with potatoes and peas (60 cents apiece). There is also a good selection of spiced cashews and peanuts.  The Jain family, who hail from a long line of halwai, or sweet makers, in northern India, opened Bengali Sweet House in Iselin in 1998.

Four or five salads are also part of the daily mix. The many rotating options include bow-tie pasta with Asiago cheese in a lemon dressing; carrot and golden raisins, yellow rice and black beans; and Greek and Cobb salads. Most popular is the chicken Caesar pasta salad.  Inside, the Cooking Company seats just eight (there is additional seating out front in warm weather). But a chef, pastry chef and two assistants turn out a good number of luscious dishes to go, including walnut-crusted pork loin with a mustard cream sauce, and many comfort foods, like chicken potpie, chicken enchiladas and various lasagnas.  Desserts are a big deal here, said the owner, Susan Bauer, citing the peanut chocolate mousse cake, hazelnut mousse cake and coconut cake with passion-fruit mousse as being especially popular. Virtually everything is made in-house except the breads, which are from Fabled Foods in Deep River.

Dinners ($4.95 to $5.95) consist of a main dish, like macaroni and cheese, and a side, suitable for reheating.

The store has a special doorway and mini shopping carts, just for children. There is a kitchen on the premises where the food is prepared using preservative-free and, whenever possible, organic ingredients.  A counter serves ice cream, sandwiches, smoothies and fruit kebabs.

This philosophy, along with his refusal to use herbicides, antibiotics or other chemicals in raising the animals, helped Footsteps Farm become the first farm in Connecticut to receive a ''Certified Humane Raised and Handled'' designation from Humane Farm Animal Care, a nonprofit organization based in Virginia that seeks to improve the lives of farm animals.  Farmers say the designation is important because it demonstrates to consumers that a third party has agreed that their animals are being raised in a natural manner. Mr. Floyd said he sought the certification because it was in keeping with his outlook.  ''An organic chicken generally means it was fed organic grain,'' he said. ''It can still mean it was never outside and never had a chicken life.''  He said that while pigs are social animals that have round noses so they can root in the ground, most of those raised for consumption spend their lives alone and confined in windowless, concrete-floored pens.  Fowls are meant to scratch in the earth, but many chickens and turkeys that end up on our plates have had their beaks clipped, he said.  Footsteps Farm is one of 55 food producers nationwide to receive the Certified Humane designation. Holly Bridges, director of outreach for Humane Farm Animal Care, said the program began in May 2003.  Producers with the designation include family farms like Footsteps, packers like Mosner Veal in the Bronx and food marketers. Applegate Farms in Bridgewater, N.J., is the only other suburban New York City food producer with the certification.  Christopher Ely, co-founder of Applegate, said his company concentrates on the sale and distribution of food like cheese, bacon and delicatessen meat.  ''We still micromanage our production,'' he said while on his way to inspect a Pennsylvania farm from which Applegate buys turkeys.  Footsteps received certification in November for its chickens and turkeys, one of which was bought by Martha Stewart for Thanksgiving. Mr. Floyd said he expected that his pigs would also soon be certified.  Besides being free to roam in their paddocks and mingle with one another, his small herd of red-colored Tamworth pigs are the same breed that his ancestors might have raised when they began working the land in 1712, he said.  He specializes in heritage breeds that are becoming endangered as food producers genetically engineer animals to grow bigger and faster, he said. Many big food producers have genetically altered pigs that grow to market weight in six months, while his pigs take 10 to 12 months to reach optimal size, he said.  Not only does he want to help preserve endangered breeds like the Tamworth pigs, Bourbon Red turkeys and Highland cattle, but he also wants animals that are more genetically natural, he said.  In the end, Mr. Floyd said, everyone benefits.  ''If a pig is happy, it affects the taste of the meat,'' he said.  FARMING",

What ensues is a food fiesta.  Although this warehouse sale is small -- it's more of a boutique sale -- you will find everything to make a meal from start to finish. For instance, if you pick up some creamy fava beans, spicy chorizo and morcilla (blood) sausages and saffron, you will be on your way to making fabada asturiana, a rich Spanish stew. To make the perfect paella, buy some Bomba rice and a paella pan, which Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9 sells in several styles. The piquillo peppers from Navarra are good stuffed with goat cheese or with bonito tuna, both of which are sold here.  But the stars of this sale -- as with Spanish cuisine in general -- are the foods you can serve as tapas. Conrad Adillon, who owns the business, even serves tapas for customers to sample as they shop and socialize. He started the warehouse sales in 2001 because he wanted to introduce his friends and neighbors to the foods of his native Catalonia and all of Spain. The atmosphere is convivial, and Mr. Adillon is always eager to share recipes.  There is usually Serrano ham, lomo (dry-cured pork loin), stuffed olives, white asparagus, boquerones (anchovies) and an assortment of cheeses, including the popular Manchego cheese, which pairs nicely with membrillo, or quince paste. Prices for all of the foods vary according to brand, but are moderate and sometimes even cheaper than wholesale. Products are also sold on Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9's Web site.  Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9 Foods, 54 Schuyler Street, Belleville; (973) 759-0333 or www.oleolefoods.com. Open the second Saturday of the month from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The next warehouse sale is Jan. 13.

            "fulltext": "EMME of Capri, on Stamford's restaurant row (Summer Street), is so small you may pass it so quickly you'll have to backtrack.  Small doesn't mean insignificant, however. The mustard walls, with wood wainscoting and paintings of Italy, create the effect of an intimate cafe, warm and snug. The good-size menu features a number of interesting southern Italian choices, both for starters and entrees, and several intriguing desserts, a bit unusual for an Italian restaurant.  The crusty bread served with a pungent extra virgin olive oil was a good sign of pleasant dishes ahead.  I especially liked the Italian crepes as a starter. Stuffed with shiitake mushrooms, shrimp and artichoke hearts, they came in a gently seasoned brandy cream sauce with shallots. The portion was sensibly sized, so it didn't kill my appetite for an entree.  Other good choices were calamari all' agro, squid sauced in a piquant citrus sauce, and calamari and zucchini, the calamari crisply fried and mixed with fresh sliced zucchini. Funghi trifolati was also a winning selection -- three different mushrooms (shiitake, porcini and portobello) saut\u00e9ed in white truffle oil.  If you favor salad as a starter, there are seven to choose from. I was partial to the mista (fresh baby greens in olive oil and balsamic vinegar), both simple and zesty. Also appealing was the contadina -- crispy romaine lettuce with shaved parmigiano and crumbled Gorgonzola cheese in a sharp balsamic glaze.  Each menu comes with a printed attachment of the evening specials (a patron-friendly improvement on the verbal recitation at so many other places). One of my guests ordered cernia alla griglia -- fresh red grouper grilled, then sprinkled with extra virgin olive oil and lemon and served on a mound of broccoli rabe.  My own fish selection was less felicitous: salmone alla griglia. The waiter neglected to ask how I wanted the salmon prepared, and I forgot to specify lightly under-grilled. The end result was a filet tortuously overcooked. But the accompaniments were tasty: thin slices of zucchini saut\u00e9ed with garlic bits and well-roasted potato chunks.  Two pasta dishes were better entree selections. Orecchiette alla Pugliese consisted of tender pasta tossed with broccoli rabe and crumbles of sweet sausage; the bitter broccoli rabe was nicely balanced by the sausage. Farfalle ortolano was a textural contrast of bow-tie pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and shrimp, a pleasing combination of flavors. Another worthy dish was scaloppine Caprese -- lightly breaded, thin veal scallops topped with melted mozzarella, tomato slices, prosciutto and tomatoes.  Desserts are often an afterthought at Italian restaurants, but Emme surprised me with its options. Both the chocolate hazelnut cake (a rum-soaked sponge cake with hazelnut ganache) and lava di cioccolato (rich chocolate cake with soft interior served warm) were delicious. More predictable were the peach sorbet (served in a real frozen peach) and tartuffo al cioccolato (a chocolate covered ice cream ball).  There is a $20.99 lunch special, which includes salad, panini or pasta, and coffee or soda. Another good midday option is one of six panini on grilled rustic Italian bread. Hearty and excellent are the Marucella (grilled eggplant, zucchini and asparagus in extra virgin olive oil), Carosone (grilled chicken with fresh mozzarella and roasted red peppers in a picante balsamic glaze) and Annar\u00e8 (prosciutto di Parma, shaved parmigiano, tomatoes and arugula in a balsamic glaze).

It is with profound sadness that the JCC on the Palisades mourns the loss of Leonard Rubin, a great friend and remarkable man, who was one of the visionary founders of the JCC and epitomized the very essence of a world Jewish leader. A man of many passions, Mr. Rubin demonstrated extraordinary devotion to Jewish education and to Jewish continuity. He initiated important efforts that touched the lives of people around the world. A man of intellectual vibrancy, practical wisdom and deep ethical commitment, Lenny was an extraordinary leader, and for more than half a century, he was dedicated to promoting Jewish scholarship, identity and culture. He accomplished everything he set out to do with far-reaching and innovative results. A leader of heroic magnitude, Leonard served the JCC in many capacities. He was a founding member, President from 1966-1970, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, an active board member for decades and a driving force behind many JCC programs. His generous philanthropic support has been immeasurable and will never be forgotten. When the JCC sought to build its current facility in Tenafly, Leonard led the capital campaign which transformed a vision into reality. Believing that Jewish education was paramount, he established the first Judaic-Scholar-inResidence program at our JCC which now serves as a model for JCCs across the nation. Other programs that Lenny and his wife, Syril, generously established and supported include the nursery school, which bears their name, the Adult Reach Center for seniors with Alzheimers and dementia, a Teen Scholarship to Israel and the annual JCC Rubin Run. Leonard was also instrumental in countless Jewish organizations. He served as president of the World Confederation of Jewish Community Centers, as a Board member of the JCC Association, where he received the prestigious Community Builders Award. He also served on the Board of Directors of Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, as Chairman of the Board of the Jewish Home and Rehabilitation Center, as President of the Jewish Home at Rockleigh, as a President of UJA of Englewood and he was a driving force for the establishment of what is currently known as the UJA NNJ. He was a recipient of numerous awards, including the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Appeal for Human Relations Award from the American Jewish Committee, the NJ Y Camps Harry S. Feller Memorial Award, and the Anti - Defamation Leagues Torch of Liberty Award. Our dear friend Lenny, will be remembered for his extraordinary generosity and commitment to the JCC on the Palisades, the Jewish community, the community at large and for inspiring generations of leaders. He possessed the rare gift of greatness and left an indelible mark on all our lives.

Because of the Senate's close partisan divide, most members are reluctant to miss votes to hit the campaign trail.  So while Mitt Romney, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, was able to meet voters and donors in South Carolina yesterday and John Edwards, the former Democratic senator from North Carolina, can do the same in New Hampshire and New York tomorrow, members of the Senate presidential caucus will be glued to Washington for a vote on raising the minimum wage.  Next week, it is all hands on the Senate deck for a vote on a resolution disapproving of President Bush's plan to send 21,000 additional troops to Iraq.  That explains why Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is spending her weekends in Iowa and New Hampshire. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois was in New Orleans yesterday for a hearing on domestic security but planned to return to Washington today. One exception is Senator Sam Brownback, the Kansas Republican. He will be in Iowa, Michigan, South Carolina and Florida today through Friday.

Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois have dominated the spotlight so far, even though they have not officially declared their intentions.  And Mr. Dodd made somewhat of an odd pick by announcing the start of his campaign on Don Imus's nationally syndicated radio show early Thursday, the morning after President Bush's speech on Iraq.  ''I'm not as well known as some of the other candidates who'll be running, but a year from now, we'll still be talking about the first caucuses and primaries,'' he said. ''Twelve months is more than a lifetime in politics.''  Senator Dodd, 62, said he had finally decided that he wanted to get ''out of the bleachers and on the arena floor and make my case.''  Mr. Dodd, in his fifth term, said he planned to have a rally with Connecticut supporters this week, after traveling to Iowa and South Carolina to gather early support.  Mr. Imus needled Mr. Dodd by saying that he had been particularly impressed with Mr. Obama.  Mr. Dodd responded with a mix of chuckles and indignation: ''Wait a minute. I come on the program, I blow everyone else off. I announce here -- at least leave the door open a little bit for me.''  The state's other senator, Joseph I.

They stood to be the earliest nationally televised debates of a presidential nominating season in memory.  They also trumped a Democratic debate scheduled in South Carolina for later in April, which was initially billed as the first of the season, and a Republican debate in that state in May.

He plans to outline his intentions on Don Imus's nationally syndicated radio and cable television shows, followed by a series of media interviews, they say.  Mr. Dodd was set to file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission this week establishing a campaign committee, his friends said, which would allow him to raise money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded primary field.  Beneva Schulte, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dodd, would not comment on his plans Wednesday evening.  Coverage of Mr. Dodd's announcement would be competing with that of President Bush's Wednesday night speech on Iraq.  Mr. Dodd, although well-known in Washington and his home state, does not have the kind of national name recognition of some other Democrats who are strongly considering entering the race, most prominently Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois.  John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina and vice-presidential nominee, has spent the last two years building support for his bid and is widely viewed as a strong candidate. And Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa have announced their candidacies. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the party's candidate in 2004, is also considering joining the race.  Mr. Dodd, 62, who is serving his fifth term in the Senate, is chairman of the Banking Committee and has spent much of the past several months shoring up support in states with early primaries, like New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina. From 1995 to 1997, he served as the general chairman of the Democratic party, which could prove helpful in fund-raising.  Some of the most recent presidential polls have left Mr. Dodd off the list, but his supporters say that his experience in the Senate could be a boost and that his personality would be an asset.  Mr. Dodd, who is also a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, has become a vocal critic of the war in Iraq, saying that his vote to authorize military action in 2002 was a mistake.

By the numbers, Republicans were already at a disadvantage. Twenty-one Republican seats will be open, compared with 12 Democratic seats. And not having a Republican incumbent on the ballot in a competitive state like Colorado complicates matters for Republicans.  Already, campaign politics is infusing substantive debates on Capitol Hill. Many of the incumbent Republican senators who have stepped forward to oppose President Bush's Iraq policy face re-election. (Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon started the trend late last year, followed by others, including Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota last week.) Even before Mr. Allard's announcement, Colorado was emerging as a gateway to the West for Democrats, who have won the governor's office, two House districts and a Senate seat in the last four years. Those successes helped seal the Democratic Party's decision to hold its 2008 national convention in Denver.

After more than five hours of haggling about making public the votes for speaker, Representative Jim Pitts withdrew.  Slightly more than 30 minutes later, Mr. Craddick was elected, 121 to 27, to close the first floor effort to defeat an incumbent speaker since 1959.  Mr. Pitts, of Waxahachie, whom Mr. Craddick appointed chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has been in the House since 1992. He has at times disagreed with Mr. Craddick's leadership, which is often compared with Mr. DeLay's.  ''It's time to heal,'' Mr. Pitts said in a speech before the House after his withdrawal and before he voted for Mr. Craddick. ''It's time to go on with Texas's business.''  The victory of Mr. Craddick, of Midland, who has been in the Legislature since 1968, ended a fight that has dominated the political landscape here for three weeks. The House elects a speaker on the first day of each regular session every two years.  The speaker's duties include overseeing floor debates, appointing members to standing committees and referring measures to committees.  Bills on immigration and campaign finance overhaul have been filed for the session, which lasts until May 28.  Mr. Craddick, who has been speaker since January 2003, when he became the first Republican to hold the post in 130 years, was investigated along with Mr. DeLay over fund-raising in the 2002 legislative races but was not indicted by a grand jury in Travis County.  Mr. DeLay was indicted in September 2005 on charges of violating the campaign finance law. He worked closely with Mr. Craddick in redrawing district maps in 2003 that benefited Republicans.  In his acceptance speech, Mr. Craddick promised to work with Republicans and Democrats.  ''I want to assure each and every one of you today,'' Mr. Craddick said, ''that I believe my primary responsibility as your elected speaker is to fulfill your elected purpose, not mine.''  Gov. Rick Perry, also a Republican, expressed optimism for the session, mentioning a desire to improve health care, education and border security.  ''The success of this session will not be judged by what has happened over the last few hours,'' Mr. Perry said, ''but by what we do in the end.''",

At least that is the word from their associates. Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, is not likely to say whether he intends to seek the party's presidential nomination until after President Bush's State of the Union address on Jan. 23. As he walked out of the Capitol on a recent afternoon, Mr. Obama only smiled when asked about his timing. Then, he rushed to change the subject.  Initially, Mr. Obama said he intended to announce his decision after returning from a holiday vacation in Hawaii, where he was visiting his grandmother and other relatives. Now, several people close to the senator say, he needs a little more time to make up his mind.  Still, Mr. Obama has been busy telephoning crucial Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states. There is, of course, only one reason for him to be making such inquiries.  Last week on Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama bumped into Ethel Kennedy, who has been a big admirer. When asked about him, she said, ''He can't run soon enough.''  Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, plans to announce her decision in the next several weeks, her advisers say. According to several Democrats who have spoken to her, as well as advisers, Mrs. Clinton has given every indication that she is running, short of saying so, and no signals that she is not.

Advisers to some of her top 2008 rivals -- Senators John McCain and Barack Obama, and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts -- replied within minutes to requests for comment, and signaled that the Clinton announcement meant that the 2008 race was truly under way.  ''She's tough enough, smart enough and experienced enough to overcome a decidedly liberal philosophy,'' said John Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain, who is preparing to seek the Republican presidential nomination.  ''The Clinton, Obama, Edwards chain match will be hard to avert my eyes from, speaking as a pure spectator, of course,'' Mr. Weaver added, referring to former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. (At least four other Democrats are preparing to campaign as well.)  Clinton advisers said that they chose Jan. 20 as the target date for an announcement during a meeting in mid-December, and that Mrs. Clinton was ''raring to go'' on Friday.  ''I have never been afraid to stand up for what I believe in or to face down the Republican machine,'' Mrs. Clinton said in announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee on her Web site, HillaryClinton.com. ''After nearly $70 million spent against my campaigns in New York and two landslide wins, I can say I know how Washington Republicans think, how they operate, and how to beat them.''  The advisers said she wanted to announce yesterday so that she would dominate the weekend news and Sunday talk shows, and to demonstrate a contrast in leadership with President Bush as he prepares for his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night.  Next weekend, she plans to campaign across Iowa, the site of the first presidential caucuses in January 2008, and visit the early primary state of New Hampshire soon after.  Mrs. Clinton appears at the head of the Democratic pack in many national polls, yet she is in a tighter spot in some voter surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire, which begin the presidential nominating process. Recent polls show Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards doing well in those states.  ''She has not spent as much time in those state as in others, but this is a woman who is not a stranger for hard work, and who is prepared to go out and work hard for every vote,'' said one Clinton adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to openly acknowledge that she was running behind to anyone.

Lieberman of Connecticut was able to beat back a fierce challenge last fall, but now his critics are joining the very party he created to win his way back to Washington for a fourth term.  Shortly after the November election, John M. Orman, a professor of politics at Fairfield University who ran briefly against Mr. Lieberman, filed paperwork with state election officials to become the chairman of the Connecticut for Lieberman party.  If you can't beat him, Mr. Orman reasoned, join his party to argue with him.  And this week, the secretary of state's office said that was just fine.  Mr. Lieberman created the party line last summer when it became clear he might lose the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont. By creating a minor party, Mr. Lieberman was assured a higher ballot position than if he had run as an individual, but neither he nor his supporters said that they planned to keep the party active or join it themselves. Instead, Mr. Lieberman pledged to remain a Democrat if re-elected.  As it turned out, Mr. Lieberman, who lost the primary but won the general election handily, later said that his party identification was not that simple, and asked to be called an ''Independent Democrat'' -- something that agitated his already vocal band of opponents.  ''It was a joke,'' Mr. Orman said of Mr. Lieberman's political party. ''There was a mockery of the system. I expected the secretary of state to say this was a mockery. But none of that happened.''  Mr. Orman is the lone member of the party. But after an article about his move appeared in The Stamford Advocate on Wednesday, he said he received dozens of calls and e-mail messages from people asking to join. Under the rules, Mr. Orman said, any critic of Mr. Lieberman, or even someone who shares Mr. Lieberman's last name would be eligible.  Under state law, control of the party can be challenged in court. But Mr. Lieberman, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday for the inauguration of Gov. M. Jodi Rell, said he had no plans to take legal action.  ''We haven't thought about the party,'' he said. ''That party won't have anything to do until six years from now.''  Not if Mr. Orman has his way. He plans to hold regular meetings to critique Mr. Lieberman. And if the past is any guide, such meetings are not likely to be quiet affairs.",

Crowds of shoppers, rivaling those at the races, could be coming, too.  But not if residents, school personnel and municipal leaders in the neighboring Villages of Floral Park and Bellerose have their way.  The open-air market, which would operate in the racetrack's northernmost parking lot on Tuesdays, Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. from March to December, has been operating for the last nine years at Aqueduct Raceway in Queens. The New York Racing Association closed the market to make more room for parking and offered its operator a lease at Belmont Park.  ''We don't object to the market itself, only the location, which would abut one of our elementary schools,'' said Lynn Pombonyo, the superintendent of the Floral Park-Bellerose school district. ''All there is between the school grounds and the proposed market is a chain-link fence. That looks far too risky to us.''  Jenell Horan, the school PTA's co-president and parent of four children ranging in age from 7 to 12, agreed. ''It's a very bad setup for the safety of our kids,'' she said. ''Predators and pedophiles are a reality in our society, and they could have access to our kids through the fence.''  Another parent at the school and a trustee of Bellerose Village, Rosaleen Shea, said: ''How do we know there won't be pornography and drug paraphernalia at the market? Or that our children wouldn't be lured away by offers of iPods or candy?''  Nonsense, said Carol DeSanto, who has managed the Aqueduct flea market for nine years and was astonished at the idea that it could be perceived as a threat.  ''Our vendors are good, honest, working people, and we don't attract a rowdy crowd,'' she said. ''Not everyone can afford to shop at Nordstrom or Bloomingdale's, you know. There's a place for an off-price market in today's economy, a very important place.''  Ms. DeSanto has applied for a special permit from the Town of Hempstead, which includes Bellerose and Floral Park, to locate the market at Belmont Park. Even though Floral Park is adjacent to the track, it has no jurisdiction over it, as Belmont Park sits outside the village in an unincorporated part of the town. Joseph Pellegrini, the secretary for the Town Board of Zoning Appeals, said a decision on the permit would be made by the end of January.  Felice Rubin, who has lived in Floral Park for 25 years and reared two children there, said she would object to any activity that brought a number of people into the neighborhood, regardless of the reason. ''It wouldn't help the quality of life in the village,'' she said, ''and it would certainly raise concerns about our safety.''  To help soothe concerned residents, Ms. DeSanto said she would be willing to reduce the number of vendors to 400 at Belmont Park from the 600 she had at Aqueduct.  Even with the reduction in vendors, said David Fowler, president of the Floral Park-Bellerose school board, noise from the 2,000 to 3,000 people he estimated would attend the market would disturb children in the classroom and at play outdoors.  Ms. DeSanto said the market would draw 8,000 to 10,000 shoppers on a busy day and 1,500 at a time. Belmont Park averaged 4,629 racing patrons a day last fall.  The Floral Park mayor, Phil Guarnieri, said that the ball fields were used seven days a week for soccer, baseball and lacrosse. ''The market could bring in as many as 1,400 cars,'' he said. ''That's not good for the school or the children.''  But Frank Formato, who lives in Elmont, which borders Belmont Park to the south, said he would welcome the market at a parking lot near him. ''I'd be happy to shop there,'' he said. ''Everybody likes a bargain.''  RELOCATION",

            "fulltext": "The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission resoundingly rejected a proposal yesterday to build a 30-story glass tower designed by Norman Foster atop a 1949 building on Madison Avenue. The decision was a major victory for a coalition of Upper East Side residents who argued that the tower would rend the fabric of their historic neighborhood.  The battle over the proposed tower has attracted prominent combatants on each side. The writer Tom Wolfe, who attended the commission meeting yesterday wearing a navy-and-white houndstooth flannel suit with a shiny pale green tie, vehemently criticized the project, while artists like Jeff Koons supported the building's owner, Aby Rosen, a real estate executive and art collector.  Without formally voting, the commission declined to approve the addition or support a zoning waiver, two steps that would have been essential for the project to go forward.  The battle may not be over; the commission encouraged Mr. Rosen and Mr. Foster to come back with another proposal for an addition to the building, the former Parke-Bernet Galleries, at 980 Madison Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets. But several commissioners made it clear that they would approve only a very modest addition of perhaps a few stories -- nowhere near 30.  ''We will ask you to rethink, restudy, in light of everything that's been said, and revisit this at some point down the line,'' the commission's chairman, Robert B. Tierney, told Mr. Rosen and Mr. Foster at the end of a public meeting at the Surrogate's Court building in Lower Manhattan.  In an interview afterward, Mr. Rosen vowed to continue pursuing the project. ''Maybe it can come down in size, and we'll study that,'' he said. Mr. Foster, who said he gained ''many valuable insights'' from the meeting, said, ''To be an architect, you have to be an optimist.''  At the start of the session, Mr. Foster offered a passionate defense of his design in a presentation before the commission, responding to objections raised by opponents of the project at a public hearing on Oct. 24. ''The most appropriate, delicate intervention is to contrast a slim, vertical tower against the original, very horizontal base,'' he said.  He said he had adjusted the color of the building's skin -- less silver and more bronze -- but defended the juxtaposition of modern glass and steel additions on older stone structures, citing additions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Kevin Roche and to the Morgan Library & Museum by Renzo Piano.  He also said his tower would be a graceful complement to the Carlyle Hotel, an Art Deco landmark completed in 1929 that sits just across Madison Avenue. Mr. Foster also noted that the gallery building had been extensively altered since its original construction, most notably in 1957 when a roof garden was replaced by a fifth floor.  The commission was unpersuaded.  Nine of the 10 commissioners in attendance (the 11th was absent) said the project's scale and, to a lesser extent, its materials and design were out of place in the Upper East Side Historic District, which is protected by landmark status. But several, including the historian Christopher Moore, took pains to praise the proposal by Mr. Foster, whose works include the 46-story Hearst Tower, which opened last year atop the Hearst Corporation's 1928 building in Midtown.  ''My issue is not with the proposed tower, which, as a student of modern architecture, I applaud,'' said Joan Gerner, a design and construction executive, the first of the 10 commissioners to address the project. ''My issue is with its location on top of the historic building. This proposed building is so elegant and sophisticated that in my mind it is not appropriate to hide it on top of a five-story building. The public should be able to walk up to it and touch it and experience it and enjoy its presence at eye level.''  Another commissioner, Richard M. Olcott, said, ''I really have been surprised at the level of hysteria we've heard in all of these hearings.'' He called the building ''very elegant'' but ''just too big'' and raised concerns about the shiny, silvery skin and the mansard roof that would separate the existing building from the addition.  He called the mansard ''an alien element in what is otherwise a very spare and rectilinear composition.''  The commission's vice chairman, Pablo E. Vengoechea, an urban planning expert, said the height of the tower ''just overwhelms the Parke-Bernet building.'' Another commissioner, the architect Stephen F. Byrns, argued that ''Madison Avenue must maintain its low scale, with the Carlyle tower's prominence undiminished.''  One commissioner, the Rev. Thomas F. Pike, called the addition ''breathtakingly beautiful'' but said, ''I'm afraid that this marriage makes me nervous.'' Another commissioner, Elizabeth S. Ryan, a real estate broker, said the tower's reflective glass surfaces were ''at severe odds'' with the existing building.  In arguing that the Foster addition was eligible for the special waiver, Mr. Rosen said the project would actually advance the purpose of preservation because it would restore the building's facade, remove the fifth floor and put back the roof garden.  The commission was unmoved. Margery H. Perlmutter, a lawyer, an architect and a commissioner, said the waiver provision was not intended to allow huge additions to historic structures.  The only commissioner to support the addition was Jan Hird Pokorny, an architect, who said that adding a vertical tower on or near a horizontal base ''has been done in history many times.''  Drawing laughter, he handed out copies of a German print depicting the Leaning Tower of Pisa, begun in 1173, next to the Dome of Pisa, begun a century earlier. ''The marriage that has been proposed was very carefully thought out,'' Mr. Pokorny said. ''I think that we would quickly get used to having those two entirely different buildings next to each other, doing their thing, doing it well.''  A leading opponent of the project, William M. Kahn, who lives in the Carlyle Residences, part of the hotel complex, said he was satisfied with the outcome but vowed to fight any effort to build a substantial addition atop the building.  Fredric M. Bell, executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, which endorsed the project, said he hoped the meeting was ''not so much a decision but a postponement,'' but said he was disappointed. ''New York is a city where scale, juxtaposition, don't destroy the quality of the streetscape,'' he said.  In a telephone interview, Mr. Wolfe said he was ''surprised and relieved'' by the decision, ''not so much because it looks as if they're not going to accept any building that big, but because they showed some backbone.''  ''They should be commended,'' he said.",

            "fulltext": "The only architectural vestige of the World Trade Center complex still standing aboveground, the ''survivors' stairway,'' would be largely demolished under a proposal by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.  Six to nine granite stair treads would be left in their original location near Vesey Street. Other elements of the staircase might be embedded in the trade center memorial plaza and displayed in the memorial museum.  The 21-foot-high staircase, which led to the elevated plaza around the twin towers, offered an escape route for an untold number of people on Sept. 11, 2001. It is seen by some, including the W.T.C. Survivors' Network, as a symbolic and authentic remnant of survival in the face of a devastating attack.  But it is in the way of the future Tower 2, whose lobby would cover much of the 17-by-64-foot site now occupied by the badly battered staircase. The staircase will have to be moved to permit excavation and construction on the Tower 2 site.  What is at issue is whether the structure should be partly demolished or salvaged in its entirety, and, if salvaged, whether it should be returned to its original site or moved elsewhere.  In a meeting on Jan. 11 that was closed to the public, the development corporation put forward its preference: to disassemble the staircase structure and salvage only the surface of the two flights of stairs and what was once the plaza paving. The proposal was reported in The Daily News on Tuesday.  A comment period, required under a federal historic preservation review known as the Section 106 process, runs until Feb. 12.  ''L.M.D.C. will make the decision, but will not do that until after they have reviewed the public comments,'' said Christine Anderson, press secretary to Gov. Eliot Spitzer. ''The governor and his staff are absolutely committed to reviewing all options once all of the comments are in.''  Under the plan proposed last week, six to nine granite stair treads would be installed in the steps leading up to the lobby of Tower 2, in the same location they occupy now, but reoriented. Both in and outside the Tower 2 lobby, the outline of the whole staircase would be marked with metal channels.  The bottom-most granite tread from the staircase might be set into the memorial plaza, said Alice M. Greenwald, an executive vice president of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and the director of the memorial museum.  The granite stair treads that are not incorporated into the Tower 2 steps might be set into the broad flight of stairs leading from the future visitors' center at ground zero down to the subterranean memorial hall, she said. Or they might be made part of the exhibit planned within the footprint of the north tower at a level near bedrock.  ''It would be our honor to include this material,'' Ms. Greenwald said.  Preservationists have urged for months that the whole staircase be kept at its original location. ''It's ultimately bound to be less meaningful not to have a remnant there that survived the attack and the cleanup,'' said Frank E. Sanchis III, the senior vice president of the Municipal Art Society.  Richard Zimbler, the vice president of the survivors' network, said the proposal ''cannibalizes the stairway,'' although he added that the museum's plans ''are more respectful of the symbolism of the stairway, which is ultimately its most important value.''  Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan passed a resolution last year saying that it ''does not believe that it is necessary for the Vesey Street stair remnant to remain in place or that its symbolic and historical value is ultimately site specific.''",

            "fulltext": "''FOSTER Maki Rogers,'' it says on the doors leading to an 11th-floor design studio overlooking ground zero.  No such high-powered international architectural partnership actually exists. But Norman Foster, Fumihiko Maki and Richard Rogers all have employees working together in an unusual collaborative office as the second, third and fourth towers of the new World Trade Center take shape.  Tower 1, the Freedom Tower, was born in a flurry of headlines as its architect battled ground zero's master planner, then had to return to the drawing board after the police questioned the building's security.  Tower 2, designed by Mr. Foster, has already generated controversy, since it will displace what is called the survivors' stairway on Vesey Street, the only aboveground remnant of the original trade center still standing where it did on 9/11.  But except for that, the towers have largely been out of public sight since the first renderings and models were unveiled last September by the developer, Larry A. Silverstein.  That is not to say they have been out of mind. Up to 120 architects, engineers and design consultants are working to meet a March 1 deadline for schematic design. This is the phase between the conceptual outline and highly detailed construction documents. The sheer scale is astonishing. Tower 2, for example, will be taller than the Empire State Building, less the antenna.  Though Mr. Rogers is credited as the architect of Tower 3 and Mr. Maki as the architect of Tower 4, the truth is that all three towers are intertwined, with one another and with the World Trade Center transportation hub being built by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  So three weeks ago, Silverstein Properties opened a blocklong studio on the 11th floor of 7 World Trade Center with desks for Foster & Partners, Maki & Associates and the Richard Rogers Partnership; for Adamson Associates, the architectural firm coordinating the entire project; for W.S.P. Cantor Seinuk and Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the structural engineers; for Jaros, Baum & Bolles, the mechanical and electrical engineers; and for the Port Authority.  The office is modeled on a collaborative studio created last year for the conceptual design phase, but it is about six times larger.  ''We're looking forward to enormous productivity,'' Mr. Silverstein said. The goal of bringing everyone together in one studio, he said, was to create ''a degree of interaction that couldn't possibly exist if they were in their separate domains.''  Michael Jelliffe, a partner in the Foster office, described the arrangement a bit more directly.  ''You can't hide behind e-mail,'' he said. ''There's a definite dynamic to it. It speeds things up.''  The pin board, where drawings are displayed, stretches about 150 feet and is in view of almost every desk, meaning that architects can keep an eye on the others' progress.  ''You can't say, 'I wasn't aware of it,' because you pass it on your way to get a coffee,'' Mr. Jelliffe said.  EVERY month, the architects report directly to Mr. Silverstein. It was Mr. Jelliffe's turn on Tuesday.  Tower 2, at Greenwich and Vesey Streets, will have four trading floors at its base to accommodate a financial service tenant. The architects originally proposed to locate the elevators for these floors at one end of the trading space, leaving a span of 150 feet for desks. Mr. Jelliffe said that by moving the traders' elevators from the center to the perimeter of the building, space on the trading floors could grow by 40 feet.  He also told Mr. Silverstein that the architects had squeezed four inches out of the mechanical space in the ceiling of each office floor without diminishing the 9-foot-6-inch height of the tenant space. This means that, without an increase in the tower's overall height, the number of office floors can be increased to 63 from 62. (What landlord wouldn't appreciate an extra 36,000 square feet of leasable space?)  Among Mr. Silverstein's concerns was the preservation of unobstructed views. He made a point of assuring himself that trusses being added to the perimeter of the structure would be only on mechanical floors, so as not to cut out windows.  He made similar points on Dec. 14 as Gary K. Kamemoto, a senior associate at Maki & Associates, presented Tower 4. The discussion that day began with the facade. The original concept had been to sandwich perforated metal mesh between panes of glass, to provide both shading and some transparency.  Mr. Kamemoto said other approaches were under study, including the use of a ceramic pattern etched onto the exterior pane of glass with a mirror-coated pane behind it. But he emphasized that the architects would be flexible and creative.  ''You know us Japanese,'' he said to Mr. Silverstein. ''We build buildings out of paper.''  BLOCKS",

            "fulltext": "If an opponent opens one strong no-trump, what are your partnership's intervening options?  You should concentrate on showing as many two-suiters as possible because that doubles your chances of finding a fit.  In the old days, pairs would play Landy, which is like Stayman, a two-club overcall showing length in the majors. Overcalls of two diamonds, two hearts and two spades were natural. This permitted a pair to show three one-suiters and only one two-suiter -- clearly inefficient.  Astro was named more than 30 years ago after Paul Allinger, Roger Stern and Larry Rosler. A two-club overcall shows hearts and either minor; two diamonds promises spades and another suit; and two of a major is natural. The intervener can show two one-suiters and five two-suiters -- a marked improvement.  Nowadays, Cappelletti (Hamilton on the West Coast) enjoys considerable popularity. A two-club overcall shows any one-suiter. Two diamonds promises both majors. And two of a major indicates that major and either minor. With this, the intervener can show four one-suiters and five two-suiters -- even better.  Dont (disturb opponents' no-trump) was invented by Marty Bergen. Double announces any one-suiter. Overcalls of two clubs, two diamonds and two hearts show that suit and a higher-ranking suit. A two-spade overcall is natural but weaker than doubling first, then bidding two spades. Now you can show all four one-suiters and all six two-suiters below two no-trump -- the best. Dont's main drawback is its stressing of minors over majors. (With a major-minor two-suiter, you show your minor, not your major.)  Dont was being used by Joan Dziekanski (West) and Ira Herman (East) in the diagramed deal, which occurred during the Fast Pairs on Dec. 27 at the Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional in Midtown Manhattan. So West's double announced a one-suiter. If North had passed, East would have bid two clubs to ask for his partner's suit, and West would have passed. (This is an advantage over Cappelletti, when West would have to bid first two clubs, then three clubs over a two-diamond inquiry.)  North, though, ignored the double, showing with his transfer sequence the values for game and a five-card heart suit.  Now East made a well-timed penalty double. He had dummy's heart suit covered and a couple of clubs to help establish that suit, assuming it was his partner's.  What should West lead? If she had selected a club, declarer could have got out for down one with a good spade guess. But West, knowing from East's double that he had good hearts, led the heart eight. Now declarer was booked for at least down two. And when South, after taking the first trick with his heart king, made a natural misguess in spades, playing low to dummy's ten, he went down three. East won with his spade queen and returned the club ten, covered by the jack and queen. West led her second heart, declarer winning with the ace on the board and cashing his winners.  Plus 800 was worth 10.5 match points out of 11. In the two-session event, Dziekanski and Herman led at halftime but fell back to third, finishing behind Peter Weiden of New York and Richard Zucker of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.; and William Ehlers of West Orange, N.J. and John Fout of New York.

            "fulltext": "BROADWAY, as it snakes through the Upper West Side, is a laboratory revealing the shift in contemporary attitudes toward historic buildings over the decades. For most of its length it is unfettered by landmark regulation, and owners and architects can do as they wish with the slightly threadbare prewar apartment houses. As a result, many buildings scalped of their cornices in the mid-20th century have been recrowned in the last decade.  There are at least a dozen examples, some restorations, others totally new works, but all demonstrating widely varying ideas.  As construction heights reached 10 to 15 stories in the 1800s, the crowning element of the cornice became the standard for how a building should meet the sky.  Typically, it followed a classical design and was made either of copper or galvanized iron. Stone and terra cotta were sometimes used, but metal could be shop-molded into intricately detailed pieces while remaining lightweight.  A mile's walk down Broadway, beginning at 100th Street, offers up a sort of design studio in contemporary cornice repair for the 10-to-15-story apartment house. At 100th Street rises one of Broadway's most sophisticated works, the 1909 Allenhurst.  In that year, The New York Times wrote that the two upper stories ''will be particularly ornate, with a large overhanging cornice.'' Indeed, its architect, William Rouse, gave the building a particularly notable one of copper, which has a higher initial cost than galvanized iron but does not need regular painting.  Later, the Allenhurst became a single-room-occupancy hotel, the Midway, and in the winter of 1992 a storm ripped off one part of the cornice. The next spring, the owners took off most of the rest.  Michael Ahren, the manager, says that three years ago the owners decided to spend $100,000 to restore the cornice, using fiberglass to imitate the original, although they had to shrink it for structural reasons. ''We wanted to return it to its original glory,'' Mr. Ahren said. ''It's 90 percent exact.''  As to size, that's an overstatement, because photographs appear to show a cornice twice the depth of the present replacement. Nonetheless, for a relatively modest real estate operation, it is an expansive and praiseworthy gesture.  The Midway's replacement cornice was installed by the Architectural Fiberglass Corporation, whose president, Charles Wittman, says fiberglass is now the material of choice for cornice installations. Because of its stabilizers, fiberglass doesn't need to be painted, he said, adding that his company has installed 13 miles of fiberglass cornice in the metropolitan area.  At 86th Street, the Bretton Hall, designed by Harry Mulliken and completed in 1903, lost its galvanized iron cornice decades ago and has the characteristic scalped look. But now a new treatment, designed by John C. Calder\u00f3n, is nearly finished.  He wanted to replicate the original chunky projecting cornice but said that the cost was prohibitive, even though projecting cornices serve to keep moisture away from the vulnerable upper walls. So he redesigned the rooftop, rebuilding the vertical wall -- the parapet -- in red brick and cast stone laid in alternating stripes. It has an art moderne look, as if it dated to the 1930s.  Mr. Calder\u00f3n's work is uncannily like the upper section of the 1980s apartment house diagonally across the 86th Street intersection, but he said that any similarity was unintentional. He sought to complement the rhythms of the brick and stone detailing of the rest of the Bretton Hall, and also leave room for see-through balustrades for future rooftop tenants.  His effort looks a bit raw now but should blend in better when the entire facade is cleaned, part of a $1 million project. His is an intriguing departure from the usual ''make it look as though it has always been there'' approach.  At the northeast corner of 81st Street, a 1913 building designed by Gaetan Ajello lost a huge projecting cornice -- either galvanized or copper -- sometime before 1980, leaving a bare patch at the top that has long been a painful sight. The architectural firm of Lawless & Mangione has just finished rebuilding the parapet wall.  Instead of replicating the original cornice, the architects have installed one that doesn't project as far. Neither they nor the owner would give details on the project, but the material appears to be fiberglass or cast stone.  Compared with old photographs of the original, the new cornice is dinky, but to a viewer unfamiliar with the building's past appearance, the result is neat and trim, and certainly shows a decent respect for the opinions of others.  On a stroll like this one, it is hard to miss the spectacular roof lines that remain intact; they give the flavor of what the replacements seek to reproduce.  The two 1910s apartment houses on the east corners of Broadway at 98th Street have majestic cornices of copper, with patina worthy of a Renaissance bronze in open-air Florence.  Rouse & Goldstone's lovely Haroldon Court of 1912, at the northeast corner of 90th, has a beautiful earth-toned cornice, apparently of terra cotta.  And the king of the hill is the great projecting copper cornice that Charles Platt designed for his 1916 Astor Court apartments, on Broadway from 89th to 90th.  Having the originals still in place is a blessing, of course, but their newer cousins add a piquant variety to a feature that New Yorkers are often too busy to stop and enjoy.

The man, Arturo Medina, 36, of Brooklyn, was climbing down a 50-foot ladder into the dry-docked barge's hull when he fell just after 10:30 a.m., fire officials said. The hole is the only way to gain access to a work site in the barge, officials said.  Firefighters and emergency crews used ropes and a pulley system to lift him out of the 18-inch-wide hole about an hour later. Mr. Medina died yesterday afternoon at Brooklyn Hospital Center, the police said.  Michael Cranston, president of GMD Shipyard, said Mr. Medina had worked for a subcontractor intermittently for three years.  On Jan. 6, Christopher G. Thomas, 51, an ironworker, was crushed by a large metal plate at another dock run by GMD Shipyard.  Both accidents are being investigated by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, according to an agency spokesman, Juan Chavez.  Mr. Cranston said it appeared that Mr. Medina had slipped while climbing down the ladder. ''We are going to audit the whole safety operation of the company, but it appears to be two completely unrelated incidents,'' he said. Before the Jan. 6 accident, OSHA last inspected GMD Shipyard in March 1998, then it was doing business as FCE Industries, he said.  After that inspection, the company paid $5,625 in fines for five violations, Mr. Chavez said.

But as cranes lifted the imposing structure, drawing neighbors to windows along Liberty Street, sure enough: it bent into a gentle S shape and then a shallow U shape, straightening out again when it was hoisted to its full height.  This remarkable three-hour display was a textbook illustration of the slurry wall construction technique that was used 40 years ago to build the original trade center foundations (known as the west bathtub) and is being used again for the new east bathtub.  To build the wall, workers for the joint venture of Kiewit and TreviIcos, the corporate descendant of the original slurry wall contractor, first excavate a four-foot-wide trench more than 70 feet down to bedrock. They fill the trench with a substance called slurry, a mixture of water and bentonite clay.  The slurry prevents the trench walls from closing in while the cage of steel reinforcing bars, or rebar, is lowered into the trench. The vertical bars are 1 3/8 inches in diameter, about as wide as the ''The'' in ''The Metro Section'' on Page B1.  The cage, which will reinforce the concrete foundation wall, was assembled on its side nearby. In yesterday's operation, it was lifted, shifted to a position over the slurry-filled trench and lowered into the soupy substance. The last step is to pump concrete into the trench. That displaces the slurry, which will be reused.  Each cage represents one panel in the wall that wraps around the foundation. With the lifting successfully completed yesterday, Mr. Plate could say, ''Only 62 to go.''

The investors, which include Cerberus Capital Management, Starwood Capital and Walton Street Capital, have talked among themselves about preparing a bid, these people said. If the group bids for Equity Office, the nation's largest owner and manager of office buildings, it would seek to top a deal reached in November to sell the company to the Blackstone Group for $36 billion.  While people involved said last night that executives were interested in making a offer, it remained possible that the group could decide against such an bid.  Spokesmen for Cerberus and Barry Sternlicht of Starwood Capital declined to comment. A spokesman for Neil Bluhm of Walton Street Capital could not be reached.  An offer by the consortium could result in a bidding war for Equity Office, pitting two of the most powerful financial firms in the nation against each other for a deal that would be the largest leveraged buyout in history, surpassing the $33 billion that a consortium of private equity groups paid for the health care company HCA Inc. in August.  A bid by the consortium would also be one of the first instances of a private equity firm's trying to top another firm's deal after an agreement had been struck.  When Blackstone reached its deal with Equity Office, the purchase price -- $48.50 a share -- was instantly derided by some shareholders as too low. James S. Corl, the chief investment officer for the real estate firm Cohen & Steers, the largest shareholder in Equity Office, criticized the deal publicly and suggested that another bidder should emerge.  Under the terms of Equity Office's agreement with Blackstone, Equity Office can consider offers from rival bidders. A shareholder vote on that deal is scheduled for Feb. 5. If the consortium were to top Blackstone's offer, Blackstone would be entitled to a breakup fee of $200 million. Blackstone also has the right to match any rival offer.  Speculation about a rival offer has been increasing in recent weeks.

Orbitz's parent company, Travelport, has hired the investment bank UBS to explore an initial public offering for the subsidiary, according to a person briefed on the plan.  Travelport hopes to hold an offering for Orbitz in the second quarter and is considering listing the shares on the New York or London stock exchanges, this person said, adding that it expected to sell about a third of Orbitz's equity at a price that could value the entire business at $2.5 billion to $3 billion.  Orbitz, which allows customers to find and book airline and hotel reservations online, was part of the publicly traded Cendant until August, when a private buyout firm, the Blackstone Group, took Travelport private for $4.3 billion in cash. The sale was part of Cendant's split into four companies, which resulted in Cendant's being renamed the Avis Budget Group.  In addition to Orbitz, Travelport owns Galileo, a reservation-booking service for travel agents and corporations, and Gullivers Travel Associates, a wholesaler. Travelport recently agreed to buy Worldspan, a service that competes with Galileo, in a $1.4 billion deal.  Travelport's business-to-consumer segment, which includes Orbitz and CheapTickets, reported net revenue of $193 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 -- about 30 percent of Travelport's total revenue during the period.  A spokesman for Travelport declined to comment on the potential Orbitz offering.  Orbitz competes with consumer travel sites like Expedia, which was spun off from IAC/InterActiveCorp as a public company in 2005, and Travelocity, which is owned by Sabre Holdings.  Late last year, two private equity firms, Silver Lake Partners and the Texas Pacific Group, agreed to take Sabre private for $4.3 billion.  Cendant paid $1.25 billion in cash for Orbitz in November 2004. At the time, Orbitz was publicly traded but controlled by an alliance of major airlines that created it.",

            "fulltext": "Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange traded trans-Atlantic insults on Monday, as London exchange shareholders consider Nasdaq's $5.3 billion hostile takeover offer.  Nasdaq has been trying to take over the London exchange since March, but has failed to lure London executives to the negotiating table.  ''Without Nasdaq, your L.S.E. shares would be worth far less,'' the Nasdaq Stock Market said on the front of a 34-page document sent Monday to London exchange shareholders. Nasdaq said a ''complacent'' London exchange was facing customer dissatisfaction and increased competition. And Nasdaq said it might even pair up with someone else to compete with London if this deal did not go through.  The London exchange replied that Nasdaq's arguments were ''self-serving'' and ''blatantly misleading,'' criticizing in particular the industry comparisons the New York exchange used for its financial arguments.  Nasdaq is expected to extend its preliminary deadline of Thursday for shareholders to tender their shares on the \u00a312.43-a-share ($23.99) offer for 30 days, until Feb. 10.  The London Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has until Jan. 20 to make any revisions to its projections and plans. Some analysts said they thought it might offer shareholders a big payout, which could add debt and make a Nasdaq takeover more difficult.  The Nasdaq offer, which was made Dec. 12, also illustrates a growing phenomenon in deal-making: a trend for hedge funds or temporary investors to enter the fray and possibly decide the outcome.  Since Nasdaq made its first moves on the London exchange, hedge fund investors have piled into the stock. They now hold an estimated 30 percent of the London exchange, which could give Nasdaq, which owns 28.8 percent, the more than 50 percent that it needs to take control.  Boards and executives from both companies must appeal to hedge funds, rather than relying solely on the votes of long-term investors, who generally side with their company's board.  How the bulk of these investors will vote on the London exchange is still not clear. Shares in the exchange closed down 0.1 percent on Monday, at \u00a312.82, a sign that many still think the London exchange will fetch a higher price than Nasdaq is offering. Samuel J. Heyman, an investor, said Monday in a regulatory filing that he had bought more stock at \u00a312.82 a share and owns nearly 10 percent.  Other investors are showing some caution. Trafalgar Asset Managers bought call options, which permit the buyer to buy shares of a security at a certain price, for as low as \u00a312 a share. The London exchange also said Monday that ING's wholesale banking division had informed the exchange that it had reduced its stake to less than 3 percent.  The London Stock Exchange has paid cash to shareholders several times in recent years to fend off takeover bids.  Nasdaq was critical of that practice as well on Monday. ''The L.S.E. board claims credit for proactive balance sheet management when 76 percent of capital distributed in the last three years was either a reaction to a third-party bid or an exceptional distribution,'' its mailing to shareholders said.

On Thursday, Ms. Furse and the London exchange pledged to buy back as much as \u00a3250 million ($493 million) in shares this year, an offer that would increase the exchange's debt enough that Moody's has put the stock on watch for a possible downgrading.  Ms. Furse has said privately in recent weeks that she would prefer to keep the exchange independent, and promote its freedom from American regulators after the rival Euronext pairs up with the New York Stock Exchange.  The London exchange also reiterated that Nasdaq's offer of \u00a312.43 a share was ''wholly inadequate.'' Ms. Furse said she was in talks with other exchanges, but would not specify which ones. The discussions, she said, were about ''cooperation'' and the ''opportunity to consolidate.''  Since Nasdaq formally made its hostile buyout offer for \u00a32.7 billion ($5.3 billion) in December, Ms. Furse and the London board have refused to speak with their Nasdaq counterparts and vehemently rebuffed the bid in public, leaving the market wondering whether they were bluffing to attract a higher price.  In December, she told advisers that her best hope was to fend off Nasdaq, then use fear of the long arm of American regulation to pitch the London exchange to new buyers after Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange merge, a person briefed on the discussions indicated.  Whether Ms. Furse can hold off hedge fund investors, who are pressing the London market to cut a deal with Nasdaq, is unclear. Nasdaq, which already owns 28.8 percent of the London exchange, needs just over 50 percent to take control. Short-term investors, including hedge funds and the corporate raider Samuel J. Heyman, own an estimated 30 percent of the stock and will be instrumental in any deal.  Regulatory creep is a big worry for investors and public company executives as trans-Atlantic tie-ins create more global markets.  John A. Thain, chief executive of the Big Board's parent NYSE Group, has said that United States regulators would regulate only within their borders after the merger with Euronext, and that Euronext, a pan-European market group, would keep its French and Dutch regulators.  But many European investors are skeptical. Some express worry that the reach of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could create a situation where directors and company executives who list on any exchange allied with an American one would be vulnerable to lawsuits or tough Securities and Exchange Commission rules with penalties that can include prison time.  In recent years, the London exchange has been a big draw for emerging-market participants who shied away from United States markets. Mr. Thain has been pressing for changes to Sarbanes-Oxley rules to make the New York Stock Exchange more attractive.  In response to the announcement by the London exchange, Nasdaq criticized the market's ''lack of strategy,'' saying that it returned shareholder capital only ''when it needs their support.'' Nasdaq also said that stockholders should tender their shares by Jan. 26, because it cannot make any more changes to its bid after Jan. 27.  Analysts said they thought a last-minute white knight was unlikely. ''I don't think anything will happen in terms of partnerships in time for this to be tendered,'' said Michael Long of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London. But, he conceded, ''a lot of surprising things could happen.''",

Highbridge Capital, a $17 billion hedge fund headquartered in New York that is majority owned by JPMorgan Chase, said it invested in Louis Dreyfus to gain more access to energy delivery and trading markets on its own.  The venture with Louis Dreyfus reflects a trend among larger hedge funds to try to diversify their investment offerings in an attempt to gather more capital.  ''We saw this as a real opportunity that is uncorrelated to everything else we're doing,'' said Glenn Dubin, managing partner of Highbridge. He explained that he had considered trying to get Highbridge into the energy trading business more heavily on its own, but concluded, ''there was no way we could do this by ourselves.''  Commodities have proved tricky for some multi-strategy funds. Amaranth, the $9 billion multistrategy fund that failed, had roots in a traditional investment strategy that then expanded aggressively into energy trading. Its initial success caused investors to pour billions into the fund, but when one energy trader made a series of bets that soured, the fund lost $6 billion in a week.  Highbridge and Dreyfus will jointly manage the venture, which will be called Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy and maintain its headquarters in Wilton, Conn. Before the Highbridge investment, Louis Dreyfus Energy was one of the 10 largest natural gas marketers in the United States and had worldwide interests in both the physical delivery of petroleum and natural gas as well as financial interests in energy.  JPMorgan Chase bought its stake in Highbridge in 2004 to gain exposure to the fast-growing hedge fund sector. The deal proved to be well-timed, as pension funds and other institutions continued to pour billions in to hedge funds, including Highbridge.",

            "fulltext": "The gloves have come off in buyouts.  Late yesterday, a group of investors offered $38 billion for the nation's largest office landlord, setting off the biggest buyout battle since the landmark fight for RJR Nabisco nearly two decades ago.  The upstart bid for Equity Office Properties, the real estate investment trust that was founded by Samuel Zell, tops a $36 billion deal that Equity Office had reached with the Blackstone Group in November. Either bid would win the crown as the largest buyout ever, surpassing last summer's $33 billion deal for HCA.  The battle for Equity Office pits some of the most powerful and colorful financiers against each other. Blackstone is controlled by Stephen A. Schwarzman, who has created one of the largest, if not the largest, private equity firms in the nation.  The rival group includes Steven Roth of Vornado, once the king of New Jersey strip malls; Barry Sternlicht of Starwood Capital, who created the hotel chain and then left the company after a falling-out with its board; and Neil Bluhm, a Chicago real estate mogul who backed Barack Obama's successful run for the United States Senate. Mr. Sternlicht worked for Mr. Bluhm as a young analyst in the late 1980s.  Since the Blackstone offer was announced, James S. Corl, the chief investment officer for real estate at Cohen & Steers, the largest institutional investor in Equity Office, has argued that the price of $48.50 a share was too low because the office market is expected to keep improving over the next couple of years.  But the battle may not be tilted in favor of the new bidders, Vornado Realty Trust, the Starwood Capital Group and Walton Street Capital. For one, 40 percent of their $52-a-share offer is in shares of Vornado, at an unspecified ratio, compared with Blackstone's all-cash bid. And Blackstone has already completed many of the steps needed to close the deal. In addition, Blackstone has the right to match any rival offer.  ''A tentative proposal relying upon the potential issuance, many months from now, of more than $10 billion in stock trading at near record prices is inferior and carries vastly more risk than Blackstone's all-cash deal closing in approximately two weeks,'' a Blackstone spokesman said.  If successful, the Vornado group would break up Equity Office, which has some 590 buildings and over 105 million square feet of office space in major metropolitan markets, including the Verizon Building in Manhattan. They would divide the properties among themselves, with Vornado getting roughly half of the properties on the East and West coasts.  The consortium calls itself Dove Parent, apparently a mocking reference to the Blackstone-created buyout entity, Blackhawk. Both bidders would assume $16 billion in debt. Equity Office said that its board ''will consider the proposal as soon as practicable.''  The offer from the Vornado group is the latest sign that the cozy world of buyouts is becoming less genteel. In recent years, the giants in private equity seemed to have avoided stepping on each other's deals while banding together on others. Indeed, private equity firms have come under scrutiny from the Justice Department, which has started an inquiry into whether private equity firms have broken antitrust laws.  And few public companies have shown a willingness to compete with private equity's war chest. Private equity firms have been gobbling up publicly traded companies at a record pace, spending some $660 billion last year. The battle for RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s showed that bidding wars can get out of control.  Last summer, however, a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Bain Capital jumped in to offer a rival bid to a Blackstone offer to buy Freescale Semiconductor. Blackstone then raised its bid and won the deal, but that showdown was a sign that competition for deals was turning cutthroat.  The new bid for Equity Office may also demonstrate the differences between private equity and the much scrappier real estate business.  Mr. Roth of Vornado leads a real estate investment trust whose holdings include office buildings in New York and Washington, shopping centers and merchandise marts, and the retailer Toys ''R'' Us.  One of his company's most recent transactions was the purchase of the Manhattan Mall, a shopping center and office building in the Herald Square area of New York City, where real estate values have been rapidly appreciating.  In their letter to Mr. Zell, Mr. Roth and his partners said they would create the ''largest office REIT in the U.S. with the pre-eminent position in the best markets on both coasts.''  The breakup fee for a buyer who is able to push Blackstone aside is $200 million. ''Sam Zell set this up in a very shareholder-friendly manner,'' said Barry Vinocur, the editor of Realty Stock Review, a newsletter. ''Blackstone wanted a higher breakup fee.'' Mr. Zell is the largest individual shareholder of Equity Office.  The rival bid for Equity is being financed in part by JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers and UBS. JPMorgan's involvement has raised some eyebrows on Wall Street because of its long ties with Blackstone.  Keven S. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial in Charlottesville, Va., said Equity Office shareholders would have to consider whether the Vornado shares were overvalued.",

            "fulltext": "One week after disclosing that it might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, the Mills Corporation, the owner of suburban outlet malls around the country, said yesterday that it had agreed to be acquired for $1.4 billion by Brookfield Asset Management.  Under the terms of the agreement, Brookfield, a public company that owns high-quality office buildings like the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan, would pay $21 a share for Mills, an 18 percent premium over Tuesday's closing price. At its peak, in August 2005, the company traded for nearly $66 a share.  Shares of Mills, a real estate investment trust, soared to $22.46 after yesterday's announcement, gaining 26.4 percent. Shares of Brookfield rose 1 percent, to $48.50.  The agreement with Brookfield, which the companies valued at $7.5 billion, including debt and preferred stock, came just as two of the company's largest shareholders, Farallon Capital, a large hedge fund, and Gazit-Globe, a real estate investment company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, have been trying to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into Mills in order to overhaul the struggling company and improve its performance. Yesterday, Gazit said its offer was worth an average share price of $22.  Those companies and two other hedge funds own 40 percent of Mills and might block the sale to Brookfield at the current price, said Barry Vinocur, the editor of Realty Stock Review, a newsletter.  ''Obviously, these people believe, as does Brookfield, that there's money to be made here,'' Mr. Vinocur said.  In a statement, Bruce S. Rubin, a Gazit-Globe spokesman, expressed disappointment that Mills had accepted ''an inferior proposal'' but said the company had not determined how to respond. He declined to elaborate.  A Farallon spokeswoman said the hedge fund would have no comment.  Mills, based in Chevy Chase, Md., owns all or part of 38 malls, including Sawgrass Mills near Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Once admired for its innovative off-price malls in outlying suburbs, the company stretched itself too thin with an ambitious development program and by adding traditional malls like the Del Amo Fashion Center in the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance.  In November, Mills gave up control of a troubled project being built in Northern New Jersey, the $2 billion Meadowlands Xanadu shopping-and-entertainment center, to a venture led by Colony Capital, a private investment firm in Los Angeles.  Last week, Mills disclosed for the first time that an internal audit had found ''errors caused by possible misconduct'' by former employees. The company, which has not issued a financial statement since November 2005, has replaced all of its top management during the past year.  Though Brookfield's interest in Mills was no secret, Benjamin Yang, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., that specializes in REITs, said the company was not the logical buyer. Brookfield, based in Toronto, has $50 billion worth of assets, including hydroelectric plants and timberland, but its retail real estate portfolio consists of just three shopping malls in Brazil.  Several mall operators considered buying Mills, ''but they didn't believe the value was at $21 a share, like Brookfield did,'' Mr. Yang said.  Katherine C. Vyse, a senior vice president at Brookfield, said the Mills acquisition would give Brookfield the chance to apply its experience in real estate leasing and financing to a complementary sector.  In its announcement yesterday, Brookfield said that Mills shareholders had the option of receiving up to 20 percent of their payout in shares of a public company that will be created. Brookfield Asset Management also owns 51 percent of another publicly traded company, Brookfield Properties, which operates its North American real estate assets.",

            "fulltext": "FIRST there were the tree lights at New York City's famous Tavern on the Green. The single big elm and several London plane trees there have been wrapped with 10 miles of white mini-lights for decades.  The glow through the woods of Central Park is pretty wonderful -- sort of a ghost-tree vision in the darkest months of the year. Christmas carols have faded from the air but the tree lights remain until the days get considerably longer than the nights and we have green leaves again.  Walking west in the dark from the Tavern on the Green tree spectacle a couple of weeks ago, I came upon a block just off the park where almost all the street trees had cords of small white lights wrapped around their skinny trunks and around the branches up to the tips. This phenomenon is not limited to here in Manhattan; these tiny white lights outline trees in front of restaurants and stores throughout the suburbs on main streets and in shopping malls.  I'm absolutely in favor of tree lights strung in plain old Christmas-tree fashion. And even more in favor of lights along fences and around windows. God knows we're starved for light this time of year. But tree-wrapping, winding the cords round and round each trunk and branch, seems to have become a pandemic. It's beginning to look like bondage, especially when the tree in question is a young thing trying to stay alive in a sidewalk tree pit. Street trees are already being urinated on by dogs and wounded by cars and starved by poor soil, to mention only a few of their miseries.  I thought at first that the heat and light through the winter might hurt the tree, but it turns out the problem is more mechanical than physiological. Touch the little bulbs and you'll see they're not very hot. The extra light could have some effect, but most of the trees have lights put on them when they're already deeply dormant. The problem for the tree starts when people lay hands on them. They're at risk when people are putting the lights up and at more risk when people are taking them down. The greatest risk is when the lights aren't taken off at all.  Professional decorators put the lights on with care. It takes six weeks and a cherry picker to put the lights on the trees at Tavern on the Green. The same head gardener, a person with a stake in the trees' continuing good health, is in charge of putting the lights up and taking them down. In spring the cords are sheared and the lights are thrown away. (The area's two most distinguished exemplars of good horticulture practices, by the way, do not indulge in this kind of tree-wrapping. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden doesn't wrap any of its living trees. At the New York Botanical Garden, a lighting engineer puts lights on three small cherry trees in containers by the visitors' center with watchful horticulture staff standing by.)  As for taking the cords off, it's almost impossible to unwind them gently come spring. If you've ever undressed a Christmas tree you know how tempting it is to give a yank. On a cut tree that's not a big deal; on a live tree it could pull off branch tips or whole branches. While professional decorators working on other trees have probably put the lights on attentively (with their invoices still to be presented), they note that they're not removed with the same care.  The worst damage to the tree occurs when the strings of lights are simply left on to shine again next winter. As the trunk and branches grow thicker, the circling cords dig into the bark and impede the movement of food and water up and down the tree. Girdling trees (not with light cords, but by taking off a thin strip of bark all the way around the trunk) is what early American farmers did when they wanted to kill off trees and clear a field. Nowadays you can see cords cutting into the trunks of banyan trees in Honolulu and palm trees in Miami Beach, which are wrapped with lights year-round.  My husband refuses to see what I've come to term ''tree-throttling'' as an outrage, and of course there are more terrible crimes against nature. The lights are pretty, he says, and they highlight the shape of the tree. Yes, but plain old Christmas-tree-style lights strung along -- but not around -- the branches are also pretty and without the garrote effect. A river birch or maple or palm or banyan is beautifully highlighted with a spotlight shining on it from the ground below.  Glowing trees fill a need. What bothers me is that in trying to cheer ourselves in winter we're not fully taking in the fact that these trees are alive, that given care they will be useful and beautiful in other seasons -- and that they're more than our accessories.

The orbiter's high-resolution camera was able to spot not only where the Opportunity rover is exploring, but even its tracks in the sand. Elsewhere, the sharper-than-ever images have revealed large boulders in areas that previously looked smooth, which led NASA to reconsider the landing site for its Phoenix mission, scheduled to set down in 2008.  A Polar Canyon, Dipped in Color  The false-color image, right, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's high-resolution camera, shows part of the side wall of Chasma Boreale, a canyon in Mars' north polar region. The reddish area is dust-colored ice at the top of the canyon. The stripes are layers of different materials that have piled on top of each other, and the dark material at the bottom of the canyon may have been sand dunes.  Perservering on the Ground  NASA's rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, were designed to last just three months on Mars, but both of them passed their third anniversaries this month. The two rovers are aging. The right front wheel on Spirit no longer turns, for example, and one of Opportunity's turning motors has failed. But Spirit continues to drive on its other five wheels, and Opportunity just makes wider turns. While Spirit hunkered down through most of winter -- the season is now turning to spring -- Opportunity drove five miles to reach Victoria Crater. Below left is Opportunity's view of Cape St. Mary, one of the promontories that jut into the half-mile-wide crater as other parts of the crater edge erode. What the scientists see so far at Victoria Crater fits with their notion that this region of Mars was once wet. Like other craters in Meridiani Planum, the plains that Opportunity landed on, the rocks appear to have formed from sediments that were pushed by flowing water, dried out and then blown around by wind. What the scientists have not seen yet: finer sediments that settle out on a lake bottom. ''What we would love to find is evidence for a standing body of water,'' said John Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the rover science team.

            "fulltext": "As scientists have predicted but have had a hard time proving, the surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, appears to be dotted with lakes of liquid methane. The lakes are more intriguing evidence of the active phenomena at play on the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere.  The discovery, reported yesterday by an international team of researchers, was made by a radar survey of Titan's high northern latitudes by the Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn and its retinue of satellites since July 2004. One of the mission's major objectives is the investigation of Titan's environment, thought to be a frigid version of conditions on the primordial Earth.  The radar imaging system detected more than 75 dark patches in the landscape near Titan's northern polar region, the scientists said in a detailed description of the find published today in the journal Nature.  The patches, they said, indicated smooth surfaces in an otherwise rugged topography, suggesting lake beds either partly dry or filled with liquid. These smooth surfaces, more or less circular and with diameters ranging from 2 miles to 40 miles, are associated with channels that appear to have been formed by flowing liquids, presumably tributaries to the lakes.  Methane exists in Titan's atmosphere and, in the extreme cold of high latitudes, is expected to rain on the surface and be present as liquids in subsurface reservoirs.  The radar images, made on a close pass of Saturn's largest moon by the Cassini spacecraft in July, ''provide definitive evidence for the presence of lakes on the surface of Titan,'' the discovery team concluded.  When the spacecraft conducted its first radar search above 70 degrees north latitude, Ellen R. Stofan, leader of the team, said in an interview, ''We saw a huge swath of the surface just covered with lakes, like Minnesota.''  Dr. Stofan is a planetary scientist at Proxemy Research, a contractor in Virginia to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and also at University College London. Other team members include researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which directs the Cassini mission; the University of Arizona; and several European institutions.  In an accompanying article in the journal, Christophe Sotin, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was not involved in the research, wrote that the lakes and other mission findings were strong evidence that ''methane on Titan plays the role of water on Earth.'' It is the second-most abundant component of Titan's atmosphere, after nitrogen.  The discovery, Dr. Sotin concluded, adds to the ''weight of evidence'' that processes on and beneath Titan's surface must be similar to those dominating the early evolution of any Earth-like planet.  ''As far as we know, there is only one planetary body that displays more dynamism than Titan,'' he wrote. ''Its name is Earth.''  Finding large bodies of liquid methane and probably ethane on Titan, in lakes or perhaps vast seas, had long been hypothesized, based on telescope observations of that moon's smoggy methane-rich atmosphere and by the two Voyager spacecraft that passed close some 30 years ago. But the Cassini remote-sensing instruments had failed to detect an ocean, though they and the European Space Agency's Huygens lander did find traces of the channels where liquids had apparently flowed across the surface.  On Cassini's previous encounters with Titan, the smog-penetrating radar found no smaller liquid bodies, until it observed the region from 70 degrees north latitude to 83 degrees north latitude. At present, it is winter in Titan's north. Methane is one of the few molecules to exist as a liquid in such cold conditions, scientists said, and is the most plausible explanation for the smooth, dark surfaces in the radar images.  Dr. Stofan said that the lake depressions could be volcanic craters or sinkholes; very few craters gouged out by meteorite impacts have been detected on Titan. Their roughly circular shapes and steep-sided rims are typical of volcanic depressions. Surface collapses, as in sinkholes, could fill the lakes with liquids from interior chambers, like aquifers on Earth.  In both cases, scientists said, methane vapor condensing and raining out of the cold Titan sky was probably a significant source of the liquid in the lakes.  Jonathan I. Lunine of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team, described in an interview what the lakes probably look like. The methane liquid would be transparent, enough to see the dark hydrocarbon sediments on the floor of shallow lakes. The liquid would be less viscous than water, perhaps like gasoline. Overhead, aerosols, minute particles in the upper atmosphere, presumably cast a dim orange light on the lake. In the dark of winter, one would need a flashlight to walk the shore.",

            "fulltext": "ONCE I floated through life in a haze of good fellowship. I believed in recycling and saving the planet; I wasn't an activist out on the barricades or sitting at the top of a threatened redwood tree, but I certainly supported the people who were. I recycled back in the days when going to the recycling center meant a 20-mile round trip. I used cloth napkins and unbleached paper towels. I didn't use disposable coffee filters. I shopped with string bags to keep plastic out of the landfill and embarrassed my daughter by packing her school lunch in reused bread bags. I bought my cleaning products at the health food store, refilling bottles to save on packaging.  I liked to feel that I trod lightly on the earth -- that is, until eight years ago, when I bought a little house at the Jersey Shore and became someone I wouldn't even have wanted to know before. It was a gradual metamorphosis -- I didn't wake up a cockroach, but I did wake up considering the use of serious pesticides to get rid of the huge ones in my kitchen. Not to mention the termites the house inspector told me had chewed a sill in the crawl space or the carpenter ants leaving little piles of sawdust in the bathroom.  I, who believed in nothing stronger than pyrethrins and who had previously controlled pests with an organic, orange-peel-based spray, was confronted by an army of pest-control agents with vans full of toxic chemicals and a nuclear attitude toward the insect kingdom. It kept me awake nights. How could I put chemicals into the air and ground, maybe the water table? But how could I not? This house was the biggest investment of my life to date -- the previous big-ticket item being a two-door Ford Fiesta. In a panic, I researched lower-impact alternatives like termite bait stations, but in the end I gave in to the pest-control guys with the best environmental spiel. I know they were winking when my back was turned.  Then demolition began on the back part of the house. As the work crew passed by toting wood and wallboard, I wrung my hands and asked exactly what they were going to do with it. Oh, they assured me, it would all be dumped in the right places. But dumped? Not salvaged? (I seemed to have forgotten that I had a humble, jerry-built seaside cottage with little worth salvaging, not some antebellum plantation house with hearts of pine floors.) Suddenly I was the cause of destruction and questionable renovations. Should I really have demolished the owner-built enclosed side porch with the five-foot ceiling? The house did look different. Had I trespassed on its cottage nature? I couldn't even look at the wreckage in the Dumpster; I imagined it multiplied by the Dumpsters all over town, then the state, the country.  Meanwhile, I was still locked in a battle with the natural world, whose cause and future I had so firmly espoused. Maybe roaches and termites had never been a big part of it, in my view, but trees! Having bought the house in the spring and being a little vague about tree species, I thought the Norway maples might be sugar maples and waited hopefully for the blaze of color that never came. Now, after years of bagging leaves and pulling up seedlings, I refer to the maples as weed trees and find myself planning their demise. I have already gotten rid of the gone-wild privets that were sucking up nutrients from my garden.  I had such plans for my garden. Nature and I would work hand in hand. I would plant only native plants at home in the acid, sandy soil. I would maintain a Xeriscape. I would not be prodigal with water like my neighbors with their fancy watering systems, their total disregard for so precious a commodity. I guess I hadn't counted on the power of garden books and glossy magazine articles. How could I resist those twining roses, the huge stars of clematis, billowing lilacs? It was hard to work up the same enthusiasm for chokeberry and Jersey tea. The lilacs sulk and have to be fed lime, which creates a stifling dust. The roses do well, with constant feeding and watering. I use organic fertilizer and soaker hoses, but I know it isn't really right. At least, I tell myself, I'm not planting anything invasive: no porcelain berry for me, and no wasteful attempts to grow more grass. Yet I can't see how to get rid of my scrap of front lawn, the buffer between my porch and the sidewalk.  At least I planned to get a push mower to cut the lawn, like my friend Linda in Boston who mows a grassy space at least twice the size. Instead I got a lawn service. I didn't mean to do it. My neighbor recommended it when I was overwhelmed by my efforts to reclaim the neglected garden. Years later, I still have it, the workers spewing noise and smoke, adding to the cacophony and pollution that is suburbia. I hide in the summer when the men pull up with the big trailer and unload a machine almost the size of my lawn. I cringe in the fall at the racket of their leaf blowers as they generate a cloud of leaves and exhaust that all but dims the sun. But who else will clean my gutters?  Back when I was first looking at houses, my real estate agent took me to see a tiny cottage. We looked around as the owner stood anxiously by. It was too small for me, but neat as a pin and lovingly restored.  ''Why is she selling?'' I asked when we were outside.  My agent shrugged.  ''She's one of those people who shouldn't own a house. It makes her too nervous.''  I imagine myself in that homeowner's place one day. The question is asked. The agent shrugs.  ''She's one of those people who shouldn't own a house. It makes her feel too guilty.''  HOME WORK",

On Sunday, a week after perhaps 30 dolphins first entered the bays on the northern part of Long Island's south fork , rescuers began efforts to save a group in a small, shallow cove in Northwest Harbor.  All three attempts to drive the dolphins out to deeper waters in Gardiners Bay and eventually the ocean on Sunday were unsuccessful.  Through thick fog, several boats tried to herd the dolphins by using small devices, called pingers for the high-frequency sound they produce, towed in the water. Each time they neared the harbor's narrow outlet, nearby sandbars and shallows, they panicked and retreated back to the deeper cove.  ''It's like trying to push them over a fence,'' said Chuck Hamilton, a regional supervisor for New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation.  He called the next few days critical for the dolphins' survival, because expected cold weather might make them more nervous and rough seas would hinder further rescue attempts.  More than 80 dolphin rescuers, including a crew with a dolphin ambulance, were in the harbor on Sunday.  Officials said that the dolphins were lured to the local bays by warm water and by abundant baitfish, a food source that now appears to be depleted.  Necropsy results on the dead dolphins were not yet available and the cause of their deaths was still unclear. But Mr. Hamilton said: ''We haven't seen any evidence'' of the dolphins' eating on Saturday or Sunday.",

            "fulltext": "The Fish and Eel Team  It's rare for two species to help each other while hunting, and it's easy to understand why. Cooperation during the hunt would turn to competition with disputes over the spoils. (Humans and dogs are one species pair that do work together, but there is no dispute over who gets what.)  Now, cooperative hunting has been found for the first time among two species of fish. Redouan Bshary of the University of Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland and colleagues observed coordinated behavior among groupers and giant moray eels around coral reefs in the Red Sea.  The two are made for each other. Both eat small reef fish, but they hang out in different places: groupers in open water just off a reef, morays in reef nooks and crannies. If a reef fish encounters a moray, it may swim into open water and encounter a grouper. On the other hand, a fish hoping to escape a grouper by swimming into the reef may encounter a moray.  As described in the online journal PLoS Biology, the researchers observed groupers and morays together more often than would be expected by random chance. Occasionally, a grouper would swim past a moray and vigorously shake its head. (A video is at nytimes.com/science.) That, presumably, was a signal to cooperate: the two fish would then swim together, for up to 44 minutes.  The groupers captured more prey in a given amount of time when hunting with morays than without. Morays, too, were successful in the hunt. Both groupers and morays immediately swallowed their prey whole, and the researchers suggested this may be one reason that their cooperative behavior is successful: there is never a carcass to fight over.  Sauropod Mystery Stones  The sauropod dinosaurs were the largest land creatures ever, with some specimens tipping the scales at up to 60,000 pounds.  They were vegetarians, however, and scientists have long wondered how they could have eaten enough to grow so big. They had small heads and pointy teeth, ill-suited to mashing up the large quantities of vegetation needed. So some scientists have suggested that the dinosaurs must have swallowed stones and used them to grind up the food, much the way modern birds do in their gizzards. Such stones, or gastroliths, have been found in fossil sauropods.  But a new study by Oliver Wings and P. Martin Sander of the University of Bonn in Germany makes the case that these fossil gastroliths were not part of any dinosaur food mill.  In the study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, the researchers conducted experiments with ostriches. Though an ostrich is no dinosaur, birds may be the dinosaurs' closest living relatives. And the ostrich, as the largest plant-eating bird, has a well-developed food mill in its gizzard.  The researchers allowed the ostriches to swallow stones of different types, and measured how much the stones changed over time. They found that the stones were rapidly abraded, and thus retained a dull appearance. Dinosaur gastroliths, by contrast, are highly polished, indicating much slower abrasion.  In ostriches, gastroliths account for about 1 percent of body weight. In the few sauropod fossils with gastroliths, the figure is less than 0.1 percent, which means there would not have been enough of the stones to do much grinding.  The researchers suggested that the sauropods swallowed stones by accident, or for their mineral content. And they say the dinosaurs may have extracted maximum nutrients from food by retaining the stones for a long time, which their large size would have enabled.  Planet Scope  The search for planets outside the solar system got a boost last week with the successful launching of a French satellite from Kazakhstan.  The satellite, called Corot, carries a small telescope designed to detect the slight changes in starlight caused by the passage of a planet. The hope is that it will find smaller Earth-like planets; almost all of the extrasolar planets discovered so far have been gaseous giants.  Squirrels That Predict the Future  It's like the Beach Boys said: Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world.  For red squirrels in the Canadian Yukon and Europe, the wave in question is an overabundance of seed cones from spruce trees. Researchers report that the squirrels are able to predict when the trees will provide such copious amounts of food, and produce two consecutive litters just at the right time to take advantage of it.  Many trees produce relatively little seed in most years, which helps keep the populations of seed-consuming animals down. In certain years, the trees produce large amounts of seed, an event known as masting. With the seed eaters' numbers reduced, having so much seed ensures that more of it will not be eaten and will have the chance to grow.  It's a ''swamp and starve'' strategy, said Stan Boutin of the University of Alberta, lead author of a study on the squirrels in the journal Science. Most years, the trees starve the animals, and then they swamp them with food. ''The predators don't have time to respond,'' he said.  But the squirrels are different, said Dr. Boutin, who has studied them in the Yukon for two decades. They know in advance when a mast year will occur, and after they have a first litter, the mothers interrupt their weaning and conceive a second one. ''The squirrels time it so they have the maximum number of members in the population right when they can take advantage of that seed,'' Dr. Boutin said.  Having an abundance of seed cones is critical for the young squirrels' survival because it helps them break into a highly territorial system. ''It's such a big win for these females to produce that second litter,'' Dr. Boutin said.  How the squirrels know that a masting event is going to occur is a mystery, but Dr. Boutin said they may get cues from buds the trees produce 18 months before. In a masting year, most of the buds will become cones, not new branches. The squirrels may be able to tell visually that the buds will become cones, or they may get chemical cues, in the form of plant hormones, when they eat some.  Dr. Boutin said he and colleagues will study whether this ''anticipatory reproduction'' occurs in other animals. ''It could simply be that researchers have never thought to look because they have thought that this is an impossibility,'' he said.  Observatory",

The first snow yesterday, a chilly, blustery day, follows a period of unusual warmth throughout the Northeast and especially in New York City. A shift in the jet stream, which carries frigid air from the Arctic Circle, appears to have spared the region the usual winter storms so far, meteorologists say.

            "fulltext": "NASA will soon launch a fleet of five spacecraft in hopes of solving the mystery of how the greenish auroras above the Earth's poles suddenly burst into shimmering multicolor lights.  The quintet of identical satellites, NASA's first attempt to launch so many satellites on a single rocket, will be positioned in orbits inside the magnetic field surrounding Earth to look for the origin of sudden energy outbursts that enliven the northern and southern lights.  The space probes are part of a mission called Themis, short for Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms, which is designed to find the trigger point of geomagnetic substorms that can spring up within minutes to brighten auroras and release bursts of potentially damaging radiation.  The Sun constantly fills space with charged particles and other radiation through solar flares or large eruptions called coronal mass ejections. The Earth's magnetic field shields the planet from most of this solar wind by capturing these high-energy particles and channeling them around the planet, forming a tear-shaped protective bubble called the magnetosphere.  Some of these particles leak through the magnetosphere and pour through the atmosphere toward the poles, colliding with air molecules and causing the atmosphere to glow in a greenish-white light. From space, these auroras glow like oval haloes encircling the north and south magnetic poles. At times, however, energy builds up within the magnetic field until it suddenly breaks loose into what is called a substorm, releasing a burst of electrical current that turns the auroras into pulsing red, purple and white colors.  Built by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, and Swales Aerospace of Beltsville, Md., the satellites aim to establish once and for all where in the magnetosphere substorms originate and what triggers them, said Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos, a research physicist at the university and the chief scientist for the mission.  ''For over 30 years, the source location of these explosive energy releases has been sought after with great fervor,'' Dr. Angelopoulos said. ''A substorm starts from a single point in space and progresses past the Moon's orbit within minutes, so a single satellite cannot identify the substorm origin.''  Substorms are a recurring phenomenon that can pop up at any time, even during periods of low solar activity, he said. They appear as well during major storms caused by regular solar eruptions, adding to their destructive power, and a series of substorms happening by themselves can produce enough accumulated energy to cause damage, he said.  Solar storms can damage or disrupt communications and GPS navigation satellites, overload and knock out electric power grids, and pose a radiation danger to astronauts in space, experts said. ''Themis is a stepping stone to explain space weather phenomenon that affects our lives,'' Dr. Angelopoulos said.  Peter Harvey, project manager for the mission at the university, said the five-satellite constellation is scheduled to be launched aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Feb. 15. Observations from four of the satellites are needed to complete the $200 million mission, and the fifth spacecraft will serve as an in-orbit spare.  The dishwasher-sized satellites are to coast in Earth orbit for 10 months until they line up within Earth's shadow like a string of beads, with two of the spacecraft positioned about one-sixth of the way to the Moon and the other two about halfway. By February 2008, they will begin collecting coordinated measurements every four days to pinpoint where and when substorms begin.  To get an added dimension to the life cycles of these substorms, the satellite measurements will be coordinated with ground-based readings from 20 observatories spread over Alaska and Canada. These northern observatories are equipped with all-sky cameras and magnetometer sensors that measure currents in near-Earth space.  Dr. Angelopoulos said he expected the satellites to observe more than 30 substorms during the mission's lifespan and make a major contribution to understanding space physics.  ''Themis is so important because the same fundamental physical process is seen around all planets, it happens on the Sun in solar flares, and in astrophysical systems such as black holes,'' he said. ''It's amazing that being so close to us, here at Earth, it is not understood yet.''",

            "fulltext": "Flying over snow-capped peaks and into a thick fog, the helicopter set down on a barren strip of rocks between two glaciers. A dozen bags of supplies, a rifle and a can of cooking gas were tossed out onto the cold ground. Then, with engines whining, the helicopter lifted off, snow and fog swirling in the rotor wash.  When it had disappeared over the horizon, no sound remained but the howling of the Arctic wind.  ''It feels a little like the days of the old explorers, doesn't it?'' Dennis Schmitt said.  Mr. Schmitt, a 60-year-old explorer from Berkeley, Calif., had just landed on a newly revealed island 400 miles north of the Arctic Circle in eastern Greenland. It was a moment of triumph: he had discovered the island on an ocean voyage in September 2005. Now, a year later, he and a small expedition team had returned to spend a week climbing peaks, crossing treacherous glaciers and documenting animal and plant life.  Despite its remote location, the island would almost certainly have been discovered, named and mapped almost a century ago when explorers like Jean-Baptiste Charcot and Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, charted these coastlines. Would have been discovered had it not been bound to the coast by glacial ice.  Maps of the region show a mountainous peninsula covered with glaciers. The island's distinct shape -- like a hand with three bony fingers pointing north -- looks like the end of the peninsula.  Now, where the maps showed only ice, a band of fast-flowing seawater ran between a newly exposed shoreline and the aquamarine-blue walls of a retreating ice shelf. The water was littered with dozens of icebergs, some as large as half an acre; every hour or so, several more tons of ice fractured off the shelf with a thunderous crack and an earth-shaking rumble.  All over Greenland and the Arctic, rising temperatures are not simply melting ice; they are changing the very geography of coastlines. Nunataks -- ''lonely mountains'' in Inuit -- that were encased in the margins of Greenland's ice sheet are being freed of their age-old bonds, exposing a new chain of islands, and a new opportunity for Arctic explorers to write their names on the landscape.  ''We are already in a new era of geography,'' said the Arctic explorer Will Steger. ''This phenomenon -- of an island all of a sudden appearing out of nowhere and the ice melting around it -- is a real common phenomenon now.''  In August, Mr. Steger discovered his own new island off the coast of the Norwegian island of Svalbard, high in the polar basin. Glaciers that had surrounded it when his ship passed through only two years earlier were gone this year, leaving only a small island alone in the open ocean.  ''We saw it ourselves up there, just how fast the ice is going,'' he said.  With 27,555 miles of coastline and thousands of fjords, inlets, bays and straits, Greenland has always been hard to map. Now its geography is becoming obsolete almost as soon as new maps are created.  Hans Jepsen is a cartographer at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which produces topographical maps for mining and oil companies. (Greenland is a largely self-governing region of Denmark.) Last summer, he spotted several new islands in an area where a massive ice shelf had broken up. Mr. Jepsen was unaware of Mr. Schmitt's discovery, and an old aerial photograph in his files showed the peninsula intact.  ''Clearly, the new island was detached from the mainland when the connecting glacier-bridge retreated southward,'' Mr. Jepsen said, adding that future maps would take note of the change.  The sudden appearance of the islands is a symptom of an ice sheet going into retreat, scientists say. Greenland is covered by 630,000 cubic miles of ice, enough water to raise global sea levels by 23 feet.  Carl Egede Boggild, a professor of snow-and-ice physics at the University Center of Svalbard, said Greenland could be losing more than 80 cubic miles of ice per year.  ''That corresponds to three times the volume of all the glaciers in the Alps,'' Dr. Boggild said. ''If you lose that much volume you'd definitely see new islands appear.''  He discovered an island himself a year ago while flying over northwestern Greenland. ''Suddenly I saw an island with glacial ice on it,'' he said. ''I looked at the map and it should have been a nunatak, but the present ice margin was about 10 kilometers away. So I can say that within the last five years the ice margin had retreated at least 10 kilometers.''  The abrupt acceleration of melting in Greenland has taken climate scientists by surprise. Tidewater glaciers, which discharge ice into the oceans as they break up in the process called calving, have doubled and tripled in speed all over Greenland. Ice shelves are breaking up, and summertime ''glacial earthquakes'' have been detected within the ice sheet.  ''The general thinking until very recently was that ice sheets don't react very quickly to climate,'' said Martin Truffer, a glaciologist at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. ''But that thinking is changing right now, because we're seeing things that people have thought are impossible.''  A study in The Journal of Climate last June observed that Greenland had become the single largest contributor to global sea-level rise.  Until recently, the consensus of climate scientists was that the impact of melting polar ice sheets would be negligible over the next 100 years. Ice sheets were thought to be extremely slow in reacting to atmospheric warming. The 2001 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, widely considered to be an authoritative scientific statement on the potential impacts of global warming, based its conclusions about sea-level rise on a computer model that predicted a slow onset of melting in Greenland.  ''When you look at the ice sheet, the models didn't work, which puts us on shaky ground,'' said Richard Alley, a geosciences professor at Pennsylvania State University.  There is no consensus on how much Greenland's ice will melt in the near future, Dr. Alley said, and no computer model that can accurately predict the future of the ice sheet. Yet given the acceleration of tidewater-glacier melting, a sea-level rise of a foot or two in the coming decades is entirely possible, he said. That bodes ill for island nations and those who live near the coast.  ''Even a foot rise is a pretty horrible scenario,'' said Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University in Miami.  On low-lying and gently sloping land like coastal river deltas, a sea-level rise of just one foot would send water thousands of feet inland. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide make their homes in such deltas; virtually all of coastal Bangladesh lies in the delta of the Ganges River. Over the long term, much larger sea-level rises would render the world's coastlines unrecognizable, creating a whole new series of islands.  ''Here in Miami,'' Dr. Leatherman said, ''we're going to have an ocean on both sides of us.''  Such ominous implications are not lost on Mr. Schmitt, who says he hopes that the island he discovered in Greenland in September will become an international symbol of the effects of climate change. Mr. Schmitt, who speaks Inuit, has provisionally named it Uunartoq Qeqertoq: the warming island.  Global warming has profoundly altered the nature of polar exploration, said Mr. Schmitt, who in 40 years has logged more than 100 Arctic expeditions. Routes once pioneered on a dogsled are routinely paddled in a kayak now; many features, like the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf in Greenland's northwest, have disappeared for good.  ''There is a dark side to this,'' he said about the new island. ''We felt the exhilaration of discovery. We were exploring something new. But of course, there was also something scary about what we did there. We were looking in the face of these changes, and all of us were thinking of the dire consequences.''  Correction:  January 18, 2007, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times on Tuesday about the appearance of a new island as a result of glacial melting in Greenland referred incorrectly to a region where another such island has appeared. Svalbard, off Norway, is an archipelago, not an island.",

            "fulltext": "AS part of an initial push to recruit minority officers to the Long Beach, N.Y., Police Department in 2004, the civil service exam was opened to nonresidents for the first time. That move, police officials said, led to the hiring of a Hispanic woman and an Asian-American man, both New York City police officers.  But the department was unable to hire a police officer who was black in that recruitment drive. ''We diversified but were still missing a part of the target population,'' said Lt. Bruce Meyer, who heads the recruitment efforts for a department that had no black officers for almost four decades. ''At that point I said we have to do more.''  Police departments in suburbs and towns across the region have been putting a new emphasis in recent years on bringing more black and Hispanic officers into their ranks as, census figures show, the white population in the suburbs has declined by 2.1 percent and minority populations have grown in the last five years.  The departments are using different tactics, with mixed success, including tweaking residency requirements and recruiting candidates who live beyond their borders. They are holding civil service tests more frequently, initiating new advertising campaigns and turning to the military for possible candidates.  In Long Beach, where the black population is 6.2 percent, according to the 2000 census, the decision was made to try again with a more ambitious recruiting effort. Lieutenant Meyer said the Police Department persuaded the civil service commission to hold another test a year later, rather than wait the usual four years. This time, posters announcing the test went up in churches, and a recruiting unit was assembled from the department's few minority officers.  The effort yielded results: Some 750 candidates applied for the new test, up from 341 in the previous round, including more than five times the number of black candidates and three times the number of Hispanics. Two black officers were sworn in to the now 78-member police department last fall. It was the first time in 38 years that Long Beach had hired a black police officer.  Officer Judy Arroyo, who joined the Long Beach department in July 2005, said she had become a de facto point person for Spanish-speaking women enduring domestic abuse. ''I've seen that people call and request me,'' she said. ''They see they can connect with me.''  In Bergen County, N.J., Sheriff Leo P. McGuire said his department has also been making a big push to diversify its ranks by changing its recruitment tactics. Instead of limiting job candidates to the county, positions for rank-and-file officers were made available to people statewide for the first time. Last month, the 466-member department swore in eight black officers, seven of them women.  ''Now the public is saying this administration means business,'' Sheriff McGuire said.  In Paterson, N.J., where Hispanics make up 57 percent of the city's population and blacks make up 30 percent, the Police Department took the opposite approach by focusing its recruiting efforts within the city's borders.  In addition, the city's police force recently agreed to hire ''police assistants,'' a position created by the New Jersey Department of Personnel five years ago to help municipalities broaden their candidate lists with a more accessible entry-level post.  ''We put ads in the local newspapers,'' said Michael Walker, the department's civilian police director. ''We addressed every criminal justice class at Passaic County Community College in Paterson, across the street from our headquarters. We went to the religious community.''  As a result, the Paterson police force expects to hire 18 police assistants -- most of whom are Hispanic men and women -- by the spring, Mr. Walker said.  Maki Haberfeld, chairwoman of the department of law, police science and criminal justice administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the public feels more comfortable when they know that ''people of the same background are represented on the force.''  Dr. Haberfeld added, however, ''I do not think effective policing in any shape or form is related to someone's race or background.''  Some police departments that have failed to increase the number of minority officers have come under scrutiny by the United States Justice Department, which has entered into consent decrees to help oversee the recruiting efforts of a number of departments, including those of both Nassau and Suffolk Counties.  Under such decrees, the Justice Department typically helps shape the content of civil service exams. But Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, said the department's input had done little to raise the number of minority officers.  ''The test was ridiculous in that it was basing questions on biographical information and very subjective things such as your favorite color -- things that had no correlation to one's ability to be a good police officer,'' he said.  In addition, Mr. Levy said the Justice Department vetoed his idea in 2005 to recruit police officers from Suffolk communities where crime was high. ''Unfortunately we have a Justice Department that tells us what we can't do,'' he said, ''but doesn't tell us what we can do.''  Cynthia Magnuson, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the consent decree with Suffolk County, agreed to in 1986, has resulted in a ''significant improvement'' in police minority hiring. In 1983, when the Justice Department first lodged complaints of discrimination against the county, only 25 women, or less than 1 percent of the force, and only 59 blacks and Hispanics, or 2.3 percent, were on the county police force.  In 2005, there were 320 women, or 12.1 percent, and 262 blacks and Hispanics, or 9.9 percent.  ''Our contact with the county is through the county attorney, who has not conveyed to us any criticism regarding this department's input into the county's civil service examinations, or this department's monitoring of the consent decree we have with the county,'' Ms. Magnuson said.  The proposal from Mr. Levy that the Justice Department struck down, she added, would have violated nondiscrimination provisions of the consent decree and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by instituting a racial quota. Mr. Levy's plan sought ''an absolute preference'' to fill 20 percent of entry-level police officer slots from minority communities, she said.  Ambitious and focused efforts do not always get results. Five years ago, the Hartford police began administering the department's civil service test more frequently and enlisted community leaders to help recruit candidates.  But Lester McCoy, the assistant police chief, conceded that those efforts had apparently not worked. The 420-member force is about 60 percent white, 20 percent Hispanic and 18 percent black, just as it was five years ago.  ''We're not doing any worse, but were not doing any better,'' he said, adding that the force has not had the budget to dispatch its own recruiting teams to minority colleges and other potential sources.",

I am sad that Ms. Little did not have the opportunity to look at our school as an alternative.  St. Philip's is a K-8 private inner-city school that accepts students based on academic motivation and regardless of their family's ability to pay tuition. Thus, we embrace a more holistic kind of diversity, not only racial, but socioeconomic as well.  Our students come from a wide array of family circumstances and adversity, some from shelters each morning, some from comfortable homes. Yet, what allows our students to reach their full potential is our belief that all children are equal and, given the proper individual nurturing and support, will succeed.

            "fulltext": "SCHOOL choice, as any sane person knows, is a mixed blessing. Last spring, when it was time to choose a middle school for my daughter, Baldwin, I was not a sane person. For two months I talked to at least 15 people (and I don't mean five-minute chats) who had chosen one of three public and four private schools in or around Montclair, N.J.  The private school tours had begun in the fall. Images of the Pingry School in Martinsville, the Rolls-Royce of educational institutions, danced in our heads as my husband, Cliff, and I headed home from a meeting with the admissions director and alumni. The school was indeed impressive, but the travel time, a good hour each way, was just too much for an 11-year-old to handle every day.  Then I spoke with the parents of students at Kent Place in Summit, a bucolic all-girls' school that Baldwin refused even to consider. (We plan to revisit that idea for high school.) Cliff had explored Newark Academy's 68-acre campus in Livingston a while ago, and I revisited it online, again weighing the pros of independent schools (smaller classes, more individualized attention and fabulous-looking facilities) and the cons (elitist attitudes of some children and more than $20,000 in tuition added to property taxes that are already enough for a private school education).  By the time I looked at the nearby Montclair Kimberley Academy, where my children had loved their day-camp experiences, the public school tours had begun, and my private anxieties were marching to the fore. I would wake Cliff in the middle of the night with all kinds of scenarios, many of them products of being a black parent in suburbia. If we sent our daughter to public school, suppose the girls were mean, suppose she had to start choosing her friends based on race and not common interests, suppose some eighth-grade boy turned her head. The same things could happen in private school, of course, plus she would be around youngsters with so much money she could end up feeling as if she were underprivileged. Suppose she felt she had to choose to sit at the black table at lunchtime or, worse, what if she was a minority of one in some of the private-school classes and felt she must wave the race flag full time.  Now I was getting to the guts of my insanity. I was tortured in the Newark public school I attended, which was practically all black; the misery began in sixth grade, and it was downhill from there. I was reliving my demons -- the taunts of ''Who do you think you are?,'' ''You think you cute?'' and my personal favorite, given the junior revolutionary that I was, ''You think you white?'' I worry that things are neither worse nor better, that they have probably, pathetically, stayed the same.  Like most parents, I want the best for my children and would do anything to make that happen. I also realize that what works for one child doesn't work for another. (We have a 5-year-old son who would probably thrive in the kind of small, precious school that Baldwin dislikes.) But as a black parent I have an extra job. Not only do I have to help Baldwin navigate her class work, always to do her best and all that, but I've also got to teach her that when three black boys act out in class, it's not because they're black, that there is no excuse for anyone's bad behavior.  I have to teach my girl and my little guy, who just started kindergarten, to be proud of their heritage. I have to encourage them to immerse themselves in black history, both in and out of the classroom, so they understand why some history books talk about enslaved people as if they were born that way -- without a culture and centuries-old traditions. I have to teach, as so many of my peers were taught, that no one is better than you and you aren't better than anyone. As my old pal, the director George C. Wolfe, said of his Kentucky childhood, ''This created some schizophrenia.''  Montclair is a town that took pride in its diversity long before the word was part of our national lexicon. It is vibrant, the kind of place an urban dweller like me could live.  There are three centers of town where one can enjoy moving around on foot -- my personal test for a good place to live. More important, it is a place where my family lives among many other families who look like us and even, occasionally, think like us.  When searching for a suburban home, Cliff and I wouldn't even consider towns where there was little to no racial or ethnic mix. This decision was for our children. We never wanted them to be ''the only one.'' We know that children just want to be like everyone else, and if everyone else is brown, that's the cool thing to be; if everyone is all kinds of things then, well, you get the point.  Interestingly, Montclair Kimberley, one of the private schools we considered, has a sizable number of black students, and Baldwin already knew many of them. It would have been easy (not the check-writing part) to send her there and avoid our initial anxieties. Instead, we decided -- or, more accurately, my daughter decided -- on Glenfield Middle School, a public school that I initially wasn't even going to tour. It was not the one that is literally a short block away, where you can roll out of bed and still get there on time, and it was not the progressive school that I was leaning toward. After viewing all three public schools, Baldwin announced that she liked the nearby school O.K., but that it was ''pink -- and Glenfield is yellow.'' I asked her to speak English and not artistese. ''Well, I like pink, it's like my favorite color,'' she said, ''but yellow is vibrant and Glenfield is vibrant.''  The diversity she has to deal with at Glenfield is real and true and crosses racial and economic lines. She has been challenged, educationally and emotionally, and so have I. The next few years are not going to be a cakewalk. But a rich life is made up of relationships that are complex, with people who are unlike you, people from whom you can learn and stretch and grow. And while I didn't think Glenfield was where we would end up, so far I'm glad we did. My daughter is beaming and excited about learning. I'm happy with what's coming home in the backpack.

            "fulltext": "The growing inequality in wealth and income has led many people to question whether the contemporary American economy is rigged in favor of the rich. While there is little doubt that the gap between the wealthy and everybody else has widened in recent years, the situation is not as unfair as some of the numbers seem to imply.  Much of the measured growth in income inequality has resulted from natural demographic trends. In general, there is more income inequality among older populations than among younger populations, if only because older people have had more time to experience rising or falling fortunes.  Furthermore, more-educated groups show greater income inequality than less-educated groups. Uneducated people are more likely to be clustered in a tight range of relatively low incomes. But the educated will include a greater range of highly motivated breadwinners and relaxed bohemians, and a greater range of winning and losing investors. A result is a greater variety of incomes. Since the United States is growing older and also more educated, income inequality will naturally rise.  Thomas Lemieux, professor of economics at the University of British Columbia, estimates that these demographic effects account for about three-quarters of the observed rise in income inequality for men and 69 to 95 percent of the observed rise in income inequality for women (''Increasing Residual Wage Inequality: Composition Effects, Noisy Data, or Rising Demand for Skill?'' The American Economic Review, June 2006). In other words, rising income inequality is not just a result of unfairness or bad public policy.  Alan Reynolds, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, goes further in his recent book ''Income and Wealth.'' Mr. Reynolds argues that many measures of income inequality do not adequately account for government aid to lower-income groups. Furthermore, he says, the rich appear to be getting so much richer because of the tax-induced shifting of income from the corporate sector to the personal sector in the wake of the 1980s tax changes.  He describes the observed rise in income inequality as a statistical illusion. The consensus of professional economists is that Mr. Reynolds goes too far. The long-term trend of rising income inequality is evident in many different studies, including those of executive compensation, even if some estimates are exaggerated.  In any case, as Mr. Reynolds and others point out, income is not the only -- or even the most -- important measure of inequality. For instance, inequality of consumption -- the difference between what the poor consume and what the rich consume -- does not show a significant upward trend (Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri, ''Does Income Inequality Lead to Consumption Inequality?'' The Review of Economic Studies, January 2006). Consumption, of course, is not an ideal indicator of well-being; a high or steady level of purchases may reflect growing debt, and the ease of buying a big-screen TV does not reflect a comparable ease in buying good health care.  Happiness, possibly the most relevant variable for a study of inequality, is also the hardest to measure. Nonetheless, inequality of happiness is usually less marked than inequality of income, at least in wealthy societies. A man earning $500,000 a year is not usually 10 times as happy as a man earning $50,000 a year. The $50,000 earner still enjoys most of the conveniences of the modern world. Even if more money makes people happier, it appears to do so at a declining rate, which places a natural check on the inequality of happiness.  Studies of personal happiness, based on questionnaires and self-reporting, indicate that the inequality of happiness is not growing over time in the United States. Furthermore, the United States has an inequality of happiness roughly comparable to that of Sweden or Denmark, two nations with strongly egalitarian reputations. (See the symposium in Journal of Happiness Studies, December 2005.) American society offers good opportunities for people to be happy, even if not everyone becomes rich.  If we look at leisure, from 1965 to 2003, less-educated groups experienced a bigger boost in free time than more-educated groups (Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst, ''Measuring Trends in Leisure: The Allocation of Time Over Five Decades,'' Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper). In other words, the high earners are working hard for their money and perhaps they are having less fun.  So matters are not as bad as the critics have suggested. The dollars in our bank accounts are one measure of societal value, and it hardly seems fair that the very wealthy should receive more and more. But for the rest of us, life on the ground is not so terrible. Income and wealth inequality measures, taken alone, provide a misleadingly pessimistic picture.  The broader philosophical question is why we should worry about inequality -- of any kind -- much at all. Life is not a race against fellow human beings, and we should discourage people from treating it as such. Many of the rich have made the mistake of viewing their lives as a game of relative status. So why should economists promote this same zero-sum worldview? Yes, there are corporate scandals, but it remains the case that most American wealth today is produced rather than taken from other people.  What matters most is how well people are doing in absolute terms. We should continue to improve opportunities for lower-income people, but inequality as a major and chronic American problem has been overstated.

But I take issue with his proposed remedy for folks down the social scale: to view marriage ''more as a social machine'' that ''can be useful for achieving practical ends,'' instead of as an unreachable ''state of sacred bliss.''  Mr. Brooks has got it backward. Successful marriages indeed start out as a state of ''sacred bliss,'' and their practical achievements and social benefits flow from the mutual love, respect and fidelity spurred by that commitment.  In my Roman Catholic faith, that's why we deem matrimony a sacrament -- an outward sign of God's grace to the entire community. (Of course, the trick is sustaining the bliss long enough to reap the benefits.)  Brenda L. Becker  Brooklyn, Jan. 18, 2007  To the Editor:  David Brooks prefers to shame and stigmatize, rather than help real individuals, relationships and families to thrive.  Being unmarried is not being ''trapped in a no man's land between solitude and marriage.'' It is often a smart, life-affirming choice. Using marriage as ''a social machine'' penalizes the unmarried.  Government policies reward marriage by withholding benefits from unmarried people. Given that one-third of children live in unmarried households, better policy would offer all parents the relationship skills, economic opportunities, health insurance and so on they need to succeed.  Three cheers for unmarried people who ''don't want to marry until they are financially secure and emotionally mature.'' Ideally, people should be secure and mature when they have children, too.  But pushing marriage on unprepared parents simply increases the chances that children will live through divorce. It makes more sense to help single parents succeed as parents than to push them into risky marriages.  Nicky Grist  Executive Director  Alternatives to Marriage Project  Brooklyn, Jan. 18, 2007  To the Editor:  David Brooks recommends that we strengthen marriage by encouraging people to value it less and engage in it more. But he doesn't discuss the ''except gay people'' clause.  In our country, children of gay couples are deprived of the same civil rights and protections afforded to my child by the legal institution of marriage. They are a nebulous population, governed by no consistent legal policy by the family court system if their parents' relationship fails. It's bad for those kids, and it's bad for our country.

Easy-to-count suburbanites -- who tilt Republican -- would almost certainly be overrepresented, while urban dwellers -- who lean Democratic -- would get short shrift because of the difficulty in counting mobile and diverse populations. To prevent that, lawmakers must begin by reinstating the roughly $50 million that was cut from the current census budget by the previous Congress.  The new Congress must also ensure that the next budget includes adequate funds for projects that made the 2000 census a success. Among them are strong partnerships with state and local governments, as well as with churches and businesses, to promote the census, and a multimillion-dollar down payment on the census advertising budget. Because they will not bear fruit until the census is under way, those projects may seem easy to sacrifice in favor of more immediate demands.

            "fulltext": "Income inequality is on the rise. The rich are getting better at passing their advantages on to their kids. Lifestyle and values gaps are widening between the educated and uneducated. So the big issue is: Will Americans demand new policies to reverse these trends -- to redistribute wealth, to provide greater economic security? Are we about to see a mass populist movement in this country?  Nobody was smarter on this subject than Seymour Martin Lipset, the eminent sociologist who died at 84 on New Year's Eve. Lipset had been a socialist in the hothouse atmosphere of City College during the 1940s, and though he later became a moderate Democrat, he continued to wonder, with some regret, why America never had a serious socialist movement, why America never adopted a European-style welfare state.  Lipset was aware of the structural and demographic answers to such questions. For example, racially diverse nations tend to have lower levels of social support than homogeneous ones. People don't feel as bound together when they are divided on ethnic lines and are less likely to embrace mutual support programs. You can have diversity or a big welfare state. It's hard to have both.  But as he studied these matters, Lipset moved away from structural or demographic explanations (too many counterexamples). He drifted, as Tocqueville and Werner Sombart had before him, to values.  America never had a feudal past, so nobody has a sense of social place or class-consciousness, Lipset observed. Meanwhile, Americans have inherited from their Puritan forebears a sense that they have a spiritual obligation to rise and succeed.  Two great themes run through American history, Lipset wrote in his 1963 book ''The First New Nation'': achievement and equality. These are often in tension because when you leave unequally endowed people free to achieve, you get unequal results.  Though Lipset never quite put it this way, the clear message from his writings is that when achievement and equality clash in America, achievement wins. Or to be more precise, the achievement ethos reshapes the definition of equality. When Americans use the word ''equality,'' they really mean ''fair opportunity.'' When Americans use the word ''freedom,'' they really mean ''opportunity.''  Lipset was relentlessly empirical, and rested his conclusions on data as well as history and philosophy. He found that Americans have for centuries embraced individualistic, meritocratic, antistatist values, even at times when income inequality was greater than it is today.  Large majorities of Americans have always believed that individuals are responsible for their own success, Lipset reported, while people in other countries are much more likely to point to forces beyond individual control. Sixty-five percent of Americans believe hard work is the key to success; only 12 percent think luck plays a major role.  In his ''American Exceptionalism'' (1996), Lipset pointed out that 78 percent of Americans endorse the view that ''the strength of this country today is mostly based on the success of American business.'' Fewer than a third of all Americans believe the state has a responsibility to reduce income disparities, compared with 82 percent of Italians. Over 70 percent of Americans believe ''individuals should take more responsibility for providing for themselves'' whereas most Japanese believe ''the state should take more responsibility to ensure everyone is provided for.''  America, he concluded, is an outlier, an exceptional nation. And though his patriotism pervaded his writing, he emphasized that American exceptionalism is ''a double-edged sword.''  Political movements that run afoul of these individualistic, achievement-oriented values rarely prosper. The Democratic Party is now divided between moderates -- who emphasize individual responsibility and education to ameliorate inequality -- and progressive populists, who advocate an activist state that will protect people from forces beyond their control. Given the deep forces in American history, the centrists will almost certainly win out.  Indeed, the most amazing thing about the past week is how modest the Democratic agenda has been. Democrats have been out of power in Congress for 12 years. They finally get a chance to legislate and they push through a series of small proposals that are little pebbles compared to the vast economic problems they described during the campaign.  They grasp the realities Marty Lipset described. They understand that in the face of inequality, Americans have usually opted for policies that offer more opportunity, not those emphasizing security or redistribution. American domestic policy is drifting leftward, but there are sharp limits on how far it will go.  Op-Ed Columnist",

            "fulltext": "James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, has heard a variety of hypotheses about what it takes to live a long life -- money, lack of stress, a loving family, lots of friends. But he has been a skeptic.  Yes, he says, it is clear that on average some groups in every society live longer than others. The rich live longer than the poor, whites live longer than blacks in the United States. Longevity, in general, is not evenly distributed in the population. But what, he asks, is cause and what is effect? And how can they be disentangled?  He is venturing, of course, into one of the prevailing mysteries of aging, the persistent differences seen in the life spans of large groups. In every country, there is an average life span for the nation as a whole and there are average life spans for different subsets, based on race, geography, education and even churchgoing.  But the questions for researchers like Dr. Smith are why? And what really matters?  The answers, he and others say, have been a surprise. The one social factor that researchers agree is consistently linked to longer lives in every country where it has been studied is education. It is more important than race; it obliterates any effects of income.  Year after year, in study after study, says Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging, education ''keeps coming up.''  And, health economists say, those factors that are popularly believed to be crucial -- money and health insurance, for example, pale in comparison.  Dr. Smith explains: ''Giving people more Social Security income, or less for that matter, will not really affect people's health. It is a good thing to do for other reasons but not for health.''  Health insurance, too, he says, ''is vastly overrated in the policy debate.''  Instead, Dr. Smith and others say, what may make the biggest difference is keeping young people in school. A few extra years of school is associated with extra years of life and vastly improved health decades later, in old age.  It is not the only factor, of course.  There is smoking, which sharply curtails life span. There is a connection between having a network of friends and family and living a long and healthy life. And there is evidence that people with more powerful jobs and, presumably, with more control over their work lives, are healthier and longer lived.  But there is little dispute about the primacy of education.  ''If you were to ask me what affects health and longevity,'' says Michael Grossman, a health economist at the City University of New York, ''I would put education at the top of my list.''  Graduate Student Finds Answer  The first rigorous effort to decide whether education really changes people so they live longer began in a most inauspicious way.  It was 1999 and a Columbia University graduate student, Adriana Lleras-Muney, was casting about for a topic for her doctoral dissertation in economics. She found an idea in a paper published in 1969. Three economists noted the correlation between education and health and gave some advice: If you want to improve health, you will get more return by investing in education than by investing in medical care.  It had been an inflammatory statement, Dr. Lleras-Muney says. And for good reason. It could only be true if education in and of itself caused good health.  But there were at least two other possibilities.  Maybe sick children did not go to school, or dropped out early because they were ill. Or maybe education was a proxy for wealth, and it was wealth that led to health. It could be that richer parents who gave their children everything, including better nutrition, better medical care and a better education, had children who, by virtue of being wealthy, lived longer.  How, she asked herself, could she sort out causes and effects? It was the chicken-and-egg problem that plagues such research.  The answer came one day when Dr. Lleras-Muney was reading another economics paper. It indicated that about 100 years ago, different states started passing laws forcing children to go to school for longer periods. She knew what to do.  ''The idea was, when a state changed compulsory schooling from, say, six years to seven years, would the people who were forced to go to school for six years live as long as the people the next year who had to go for seven years,'' Dr. Lleras-Muney asked.  All she would have to do was to go back and find the laws in the different states and then use data from the census to find out how long people lived before and after the law in each state was changed.  ''I was very excited for about three seconds,'' she says. Then she realized how onerous it could be to comb through the state archives.  But when her analysis was finished, Dr. Lleras-Muney says, ''I was surprised, I was really surprised.'' It turned out that life expectancy at age 35 was extended by as much as one and a half years simply by going to school for one extra year.  Her prize-winning paper appeared in Review of Economic Studies. And she ended up with a job as an assistant professor at Princeton. Now, others papers have appeared, examining the effects of changed laws on compulsory education in Sweden, Denmark, England and Wales. In every country, compelling children to spend a longer time in school led to better health.  ''You might think that forcing someone to go to school who does not want to be there may not be the same thing as going to school because you want to,'' Dr. Lleras-Muney said. ''That did not seem to be the case.''  Not everyone was convinced.  Victor Fuchs, a health economist at Stanford, points out that it is not clear how or why education would lead to a longer life.  And, he said, there are other mysteries. For example, women increased their years of schooling more than men have in recent decades. But men are catching up with women in their life spans.  And it might be expected that after a certain point, more years of school would not add to a person's life span. That, however, is not what the data shows. The education effect never wanes. But most researchers say they are swayed by Dr. Lleras-Muney's work and the studies in other countries. That, though, leaves the question of why the education effect occurs.  Dr. Lleras-Muney and others point to one plausible explanation -- as a group, less educated people are less able to plan for the future and to delay gratification. If true, that may, for example, explain the differences in smoking rates between more educated people and less educated ones.  Smokers are at least twice as likely to die at any age as people who never smoked, says Samuel Preston, a demographer at the University of Pennsylvania. And not only are poorly educated people more likely to smoke but, he says, ''everybody knows that smoking can be deadly,'' and that includes the poorly educated.  But education, Dr. Smith at RAND finds, may somehow teach people to delay gratification. For example, he reported that in one large federal study of middle-aged people, those with less education were less able to think ahead.  ''Most of adherence is unpleasant,'' Dr. Smith says. ''You have to be willing to do something that is not pleasant now and you have to stay with it and think about the future.''  He deplores the dictums to live in the moment or to live for today. That advice, Dr. Smith says, is ''the worst thing for your health.''  An Observation on the Street  In the late 1970's, Lisa Berkman, now a professor of public policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, took at part-time job at a San Francisco health care center. It drew people from Chinatown and the city's Italian neighborhood, North Beach, as well as from the Tenderloin district, a poor area where homeless people lived on the streets and mentally ill people roamed. And she noticed something striking.  ''In Chinatown and North Beach, there were these tightly bound social networks,'' Dr. Berkman recalls. ''You saw old people with young people. In the Tenderloin, people were just sort of dumped. People were really isolated and did not have ways of figuring out how to make things work.''  A few years later, she was haunted by that observation. She had entered graduate school and was studying Seventh-day Adventists when she began to wonder whether the standard explanation for their longer lives -- a healthy, vegetarian diet -- was enough.  ''They were at decreased risk from many, many diseases, even ones where diet was not implicated,'' Dr. Berkman says. And, she adds, ''it seemed they simply had a slower rate of aging.''  Seventh-day Adventists, like the people in Chinatown and North Beach, had ''incredibly cohesive social networks,'' Dr. Berkman notes. Could that be the clue?  Thirty years later, studies have borne out her hunch.  The risks of being socially isolated are ''phenomenal,'' Dr. Berkman says, associated with twofold to fivefold increases in mortality rates. And the correlations emerged in study after study and in country after country.  Yet, Dr. Berkman adds, there was that perennial question: Did social isolation shorten lives or were people isolated because they were sick and frail and at great risk of death?  She knows that sometimes ill health leads to social isolation. But, Dr. Berkman says, the more she investigated, the more evidence she found that social isolation might also lead to poor health and a shorter life by, for example, increasing stress and making it harder to get assistance when ill.  But researchers also warn that their findings that education and, to a lesser degree, social networks, may directly affect health do not necessarily mean that other hypotheses would also hold up. The cautionary tale, health economists say, is the story of the link between health and wealth.  Over and over again, studies show that health is linked to wealth. It even matters where a person lives.  For example, in a new analysis of Medicare beneficiaries, Stephanie Raymond and Kristen Bronner of Dartmouth College find that the lowest death rates are in the wealthiest places. So in San Francisco, with a per capita income of $57,496, just 4.16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries die each year. But in Tuscaloosa, Ala, whose per capita income is $24,257, the annual death rate was 5.97 percent.  Race was not a large factor.  ''If you control for where people live, the disparities between black and white mortality rates become much smaller,'' said Jonathan Skinner, a Dartmouth health economist.  An obvious explanation is that wealth buys health. And it seems plausible. Poorer people, at least in the United States, are less likely to have health insurance or access to medications.  But Dr. Fuchs says, then why don't differences between rich and poor shrink in countries where everyone has health care?  ''All you have to do is look at the experience of countries like England that have had health insurance for more than 40 years,'' he says. ''There is no diminution in the class differentials. It's been the same in Sweden. It's true everywhere.''  In fact, Dr. Smith says, the wealth-health connection, at least among adults, goes in the wrong direction. It is not that lower incomes lead to poor health so much as that poor health leads to lower incomes, he found.  A Skewing of the Numbers  Sick people tend to have modest out-of-pocket medical expenses, but often are unable to work or unable to work full time.  The result can be a drastic and precipitous and long-lasting drop in income. As the ranks of middle- and upper-income populations become depleted of people who are ill, there is a skewing of the data so healthy people are disproportionately richer.  That effect emerged when Dr. Smith analyzed data from the National Institute on Aging's National Health and Retirement Survey, a national sample of 7,600 American households with at least one person aged 51 to 61.  If someone developed cancer, heart disease or lung disease -- which will affect about a fifth of people aged 51 to 61 over the next eight years -- the household's income declined by an average of more than $37,000. And its assets -- its wealth -- fell by $49,000 over the ensuing eight years, even though out-of-pocket medical expenses were just $4,000.  Dr. Smith also asked whether getting richer made people healthier, an effect that could translate into a longer life. It does not, he concluded after studying the large increases in income during the stock market surge of the 1990s.  ''I find almost no role of financial anything in the onset of disease,'' Dr. Smith says. ''That's an almost throw-you-out-of-the-room thing,'' he confesses, but the data, he and other economists insist, is consistent.  Income, says Dr. Preston, ''is so heavily influenced by health itself.''  Much More Than Genes and Luck  As director of the National Institute on Aging, Dr. Hodes often speaks to policy makers, giving briefings on the latest scientific findings. But, he and others say, all too often there is a disconnect.  There are some important findings: Health and nutrition early in life, even prenatally, can affect health in middle and old age and can affect how long people live.  For the most part, genes have little effect on life spans. Controlling heart disease risk factors, like smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, pays off in a more vigorous old age and a longer life. And it seems increasingly likely that education plays a major role in health and life spans.  And then there is the question of what to do. It might seem logical to act now, pouring money into education or child health, for example.  But scientists often say they would like good evidence beforehand that a program that sounds like it would make a difference, like keeping students in school longer, really works. And if the goal is longer and healthier lives, is that the most cost-effective way to spend public money?  There are just so many questions remaining, says Richard Suzman, a program director at the National Institute on Aging. Even studies showing that, for many people, the die may be cast early in life, do not reveal how best to make changes.  ''We have only a vague idea of when and where early experience links to old age or when and where to intervene,'' Dr. Suzman says.  ''When it comes to changing things,'' says Dr. Skinner, the Dartmouth economist, ''we are in uncharted territory.''  The New Age  This is last of four articles looking at the science of aging.  The New Age  Correction:  January 10, 2007, Wednesday  A chart last Wednesday with the continuation of a front-page article about links between education and longevity misstated a correlation.

She was 86.  Ms. Stolz died of natural causes, her son, William B. Stolz, said.  The author of more than 60 books, Ms. Stolz was an early practitioner of the young-adult novel. She was known in particular for her books aimed at teenage girls, among them ''Ready or Not'' (1953), ''And Love Replied'' (1958), ''Some Merry-Go-Round Music'' (1959) and ''Leap Before You Look'' (1972).  Ms. Stolz spent most of her career with the Harper publishing company in its various incarnations, from Harper & Brothers through Harper & Row to the present-day HarperCollins. Her books for younger readers include ''The Leftover Elf'' (1952), ''Emmett's Pig'' (1959), ''A Dog on Barkham Street'' (1960) and ''The Bully of Barkham Street'' (1963).  Two of Ms. Stolz's titles, ''Belling the Tiger'' (1961) and ''The Noonday Friends'' (1965), were named Newbery Honor books by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association.  Concerned crucially with character, Ms. Stolz's work often centered on young protagonists' experience of first love and on their attempts to come to terms with turbulent family lives. ''Ready or Not,'' for instance, is the coming-of-age story of a 16-year-old girl living in a low-income housing project in New York City.  Reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review, Ellen Lewis Buell wrote, ''The interplay of family relationships is brilliantly stated.''  Mary Slattery, known as Molly, was born in Boston on March 24, 1920, and raised in Manhattan. She studied at Teachers College of Columbia University and the Katharine Gibbs school before going to work at Columbia as a secretary.  During a long convalescence -- Ms. Stolz suffered from debilitating arthritis -- she began work on her first book, ''To Tell Your Love,'' writing in pencil on yellow legal pads. The novel was published in 1950 by Harper & Brothers, bringing Ms. Stolz into the stable of the distinguished children's book editor Ursula Nordstrom.  Ms. Stolz's first marriage, to Stanley Burr Stolz, ended in divorce; her second, to Thomas C. Jaleski, ended with his death in 2001. Besides her son, William, of Atlanta, she is survived by a stepson, Eugene Jaleski of Longboat Key; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.  Her other books include ''Cider Days'' (1978), ''Ivy Larkin'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986), ''A Ballad of the Civil War'' (1997) and ''Casebook of a Private (Cat's) Eye'' (Front Street/Cricket, 1999). Ms. Stolz also wrote a novel for adults, ''Truth and Consequence,'' published by Harper & Brothers in 1953.",

            "text": "  Overdue at a friend's house for dinner, I parked the minivan in the garage and urged my daughters to get out of the car and into the house, where my wife and the baby sitter were waiting. I reached into the back seat to help my 6-year-old, Gracie, expedite her exit. Which is when she hit me in the face with the beads.  These purple and gold Mardi Gras beads were just some of the plastic detritus that collects in the home of any family with small children: petrochemical dust bunnies that accumulate via Happy Meals and wishes granted by the cut-rate fairies my children find under rocks. Wherever they came from, they really hurt when they struck me across the bridge of the nose.  I took the beads from Gracie. ''Say goodbye,'' I said, and then, dear reader, I turned and hurled those beads as far as I could.  In the moment it took for the beads to arc through the air, up onto the roof of our neighbor's garage across the alley, they transformed from a worthless plastic gimcrack into my daughters' most prized possession, a priceless heirloom handed down through generations of hysterically overdramatic little girls.  Gracie howled as if I had just taken her to a kennel, allowed her to pick out a puppy and then stabbed it. Her 8-year-old sister, Rosie, whose hobby is acting out tragic Italianate operas of her own devising, clutched her notional bosom and wailed, and both girls ran screaming into the house ahead of me.  When I came in, the baby sitter was seated in the kitchen, glazed shock on her face. In the living room, my wife, Beth, embraced a weeping Rosie and Gracie, who told them, between sobs, of what I had done with their Very Favorite Beads They Loved So Very Much.  ''He . . . he . . . threw them. . . . ''  ''They're on the roof! They're on the roof!''  My wife looked at me with a merciless disdain. ''I'm sure he feels very bad about it,'' she said.  I decided to be a man about it. That is, I decided to correct the situation without ever admitting I had committed an error. I went down to the basement, retrieved our ladder and passed the still-goggling baby sitter on the way out the door.  The ladder came up to about three feet below the lip of the roof of the neighbors' garage. I easily hoisted myself up and retrieved the Holy Beads of Turin. Then I tried to come down. But seated on the edge of the roof, my dangling legs hung a good foot above the very top of the ladder. To get back onto the ladder, I'd have to slide off the roof, fall for a foot, hit the three-inch-wide top of the ladder and hope that it wouldn't topple over.  I stood up and went to each side of the garage roof to look for the pile of garbage bags filled with kapok that are always below any high precipice supporting a hero. No dice. There was a tree growing next to the garage. Sometimes heroes jump from high places onto trees, which bend willingly, and thus the heroes are able to descend to the ground. This tree looked prickly and sharp and just as high, frankly, as the roof.  It began to occur to me that I wasn't the hero.  I considered calling for help. If my wife and children came out, along with the baby sitter, any anger they felt would be immediately washed away by the flood of laughter and joy expressed at my humiliating plight. ''Papa's on the roof!'' Gracie would shout and clap her little hands together, and all would beam and grin until darkness inexorably fell.  Or: a neighbor answers my call -- perhaps even the neighbor who owned the garage. After hearing my abashed explanation, the neighbor would produce a taller ladder, and I would descend, and news of the incident would spread like ragweed throughout the neighborhood, and parents would jokingly tell their children to keep their fake plastic jewelry away from Mr. Sagal . . . and contemplating that, I realized that I would quite literally rather die, which is a striking thought to have at a moment when you're standing on a roof.  The Public Humiliation scenario was becoming more and more likely, as I stood there, visible for miles, the figurehead of the U.S.S. Moron. I sat down on the edge of the roof and, holding my breath, pushed off into space. My feet hit the ladder. It wobbled but did not fall. I climbed down, folded up the ladder and walked inside. The girls were still sobbing.  I handed Gracie the beads. ''There,'' I said. She sniffled but kept crying.  ''How did you get them?'' she asked.  ''I climbed up and got them. O.K.? I'm sorry I threw them on the roof. But you shouldn't have hit me with them.''  Beth and I walked out the door to go to our friend's house. As we left, I noticed that the beads had been dropped into the corner of the sofa. (They remained there for two months, until my wife found them while cleaning and threw them out.)  ''Sorry,'' I said to the baby sitter.  ''It happens,'' she said.  Does it? On the drive over to our friend's house, I kept scanning the roof lines, looking for rage-crazed dads, holding plastic toys, looking for a way down.

            "text": "  The two men first saw the baby from across the Bronx street, dangling from a fire escape four stories above the sidewalk. His grip was growing weaker by the second. The two men saw only one choice: run over and try to catch him.  They positioned themselves below, arms out. The little boy fell. He glanced off a branch of a tree that was brushing against the fire escape. Then he bounced off the chest of one of the men, who was knocked off balance and could not grab him.  But he landed safely in the arms of the other man, who managed to hold on tight.  And so yesterday, the two men -- longtime friends who had been looking over a used Honda that one was thinking of selling and the other was thinking of buying -- became the second and third good Samaritans of the new year, not even a week old. The rescue came two days after another New Yorker flung himself onto the subway tracks to save a 20-year-old film student who had fallen from the platform.  ''This is a week of heroes here in New York,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said later yesterday.  The two men -- Julio Gonzalez, 43, a mechanic who lives in the neighborhood, and Pedro Nevarez, 40, of Corona, Queens -- insisted that they had just done the obvious thing. As Mr. Nevarez, who has a 19-year-old foster son, put it: ''I'm not a hero. I did what any other father would do. When you're a father, you would do this whether it's your child or not.''  By then, a crowd of reporters and residents of the East Tremont neighborhood was swirling around them, and someone said, ''If you're not a hero, how about an angel without wings?''  Mr. Nevarez simply smiled. Mr. Gonzalez said, ''I feel I did something good.''  The baby, identified by the police as Timothy Addo, 3, was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was treated for minor scrapes and was released, a hospital spokesman said.  Before long, a man who said he was Timothy's great-uncle returned from the hospital to the apartment building at 2105 Daly Avenue, near East 180th Street, and showed the crowd a photograph of Timothy after his tumble, taken with a cellphone. The boy had what appeared to be a bandage on his head, but looked as if he was enjoying the attention. The police said that Timothy had been in his baby sitter's apartment on the top floor of the five-story building, and that there were no window guards. He crawled onto a radiator and from there, onto the fire escape, they said.  Last night at the 48th Precinct station house, the police were questioning the baby sitter, identified by law enforcement officials as Carol Baldwin, 50. It was not clear if any charges would be filed against her.  Ricky Serra, 31, said his daughter Alesha, 1 1/2, was also in Ms. Baldwin's apartment when Timothy climbed out the window. Ms. Baldwin also watches Mr. Serra's 4-year-old daughter, Adriana, after school. He said he would not send the girls back to her.  ''That could have been my baby,'' he said, referring to Timothy. But he added that Ms. Baldwin could not have foreseen that Timothy would play with the window.  Timothy's mother, Katrina Cosme, 26, was at work when the boy clambered out the window. Going step by step on the fire escape, he managed to work his way down one floor as passers-by below took notice.  Some screamed for help. Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez sprang into action, dashing toward the fire escape even though Mr. Gonzalez was not sure that the little object on the fire escape was a child. ''I thought it was a toy or something,'' he said later.  At first, he told Mr. Nevarez to run inside the building and pull the child back in. But the door was locked. Mr. Gonzalez realized that there was no time, and called his friend back. Mr. Nevarez said he tried to grab the bottom rung of the fire escape, hoping to climb up and carry the baby into the building. But the fire escape was too far off the ground.  They took their places under the fire escape just as Timothy lost his grip. Mr. Nevarez said Mr. Gonzalez told him: ''Stay right next to me. We're not going to let him hit the floor.''  First, the boy bounced off Mr. Nevarez. He said Timothy knocked the wind out of him, and also knocked him down.  Mr. Gonzalez then realized that it was up to him. ''I just hoped and prayed that I would be able to catch him,'' he said.  He did. ''He came down hard,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''He only weighed 45 pounds, but it felt like he weighed more than a hundred.'' They wrapped him in Mr. Nevarez's jacket and waited for help to arrive.  A neighbor, Migdalia Melendez, 43, said that Ms. Baldwin, the baby sitter, was standing behind the ambulance as the paramedics closed the doors, and that Timothy reached for her. Ms. Melendez said Ms. Baldwin put her arms around Timothy and said, ''I was only in the bathroom for a second.''  Ms. Melendez said she had been in her living room on the second floor when she heard people screaming and saw Timothy on the fire escape. She ran outside, as did her husband, Luis.  ''Don't blame the baby sitter,'' he said. ''She's a good woman.''  Another neighbor, Kyiesha Johnson, 19, said that she had known Ms. Baldwin from childhood and that Ms. Baldwin had looked after children in the building for years. If parents had to go to the store, Ms. Johnson said, the baby sitter kept tabs on their children.  ''She always tended to the kids perfect,'' Ms. Johnson said.  Timothy's mother, Ms. Cosme, arrived at the building a couple of hours after the excitement. She hugged Mr. Gonzalez and cut through the crowd. Last night, she told television reporters that she was grateful.  After the police arrived, Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez gave each other a high-five. That was when Mr. Nevarez realized that his hand was sore from landing on it when he was knocked down. His chest also felt sore. But he decided that he did not need medical help.  He and Mr. Gonzalez have known each other since they were 9 and 6, respectively, Mr. Nevarez said. They grew up on 174th Street in the Mount Eden section of the Bronx and have kept in close touch over the years.  ''We were in the right place at the right time,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''If we hadn't been there, we'd be talking about how the kid across the street fell out of the house and died.''  ",

            "text": "  Bosch's search of the radiation victim's clothes has yielded no cesium. It turns out that he's Mexican, and Agent Walling tries to connect him to the Middle Eastern terrorists, who were believed to have entered the United States through the Mexican border. But Bosch isn't convinced.  Harry Bosch knew that the physics of traffic would not work for him in the Cahuenga Pass. The Hollywood Freeway always moved slowly in both directions through the bottleneck created by the cut in the mountain chain. He decided to stay on surface streets and take Highland Avenue past the Hollywood Bowl and up into the pass. He filled Rachel Walling in along the way.  ''The call for paramedics came from a print shop on Cahuenga near Lankershim. Gonzalves must have been in the area when he collapsed. The initial call said a man was down in the parking lot. I'm hoping that the Toyota he was driving is right there. I'm betting that if we find it, we find the cesium. The mystery is why he had it.''  ''And why he was foolish enough to put it unprotected in his pocket,'' Walling added.  ''You're basing that on him knowing what he had. Maybe he didn't. Maybe this isn't what we think it is.''  ''There's got to be a connection, Bosch, between Gonzalves and Nassar and Elfayed. He probably brought them across the border.''  ''We'll see.''  He almost smiled. He knew she had used his last name as a term of endearment. He remembered how she used to do that.  He took the ramp up to Cahuenga from Highland. It ran parallel to the freeway, and as soon as he checked, he saw that he had been right. The freeway was frozen in both directions.  ''You know, I still had your number in my cell's directory,'' he said. ''I guess I never wanted to delete it.''  ''I was wondering about that when you left me that mean message today about the cigarette ash.''  ''I don't suppose you kept mine, Rachel.''  She paused a long moment before answering.  ''I think you're still on my phone, too, Harry.''  This time he had to smile, even though he was back to being Harry with her. There's hope after all, he thought.  They were approaching Lankershim Boulevard. To the right it dropped down into a tunnel beneath the freeway. To the left it ended at a strip mall that included the Easy Print franchise from which the call to paramedics had originated. Bosch's eyes searched the vehicles in the small parking lot, looking for a Toyota.  He glided into the left-turn lane and waited to pull into the lot. He swiveled in his seat and checked the parking along both sides of Cahuenga. The quick glance showed no Toyotas, but he knew the brand had many different car models and pickup trucks. If they didn't find the car in the print-shop lot, they would have to work the curbside parking to look for it.  ''Do you have a plate or any description?'' Walling asked. ''How about a color?''  ''No, no and no.''  Bosch remembered then that she had the habit of asking multiple questions at once.  He made the turn on yellow and pulled into the lot. There were no parking spaces available, but he wasn't interested in parking. He cruised slowly, checking each car. There were no Toyotas.  ''Where's a Toyota when you need one?'' he said. ''It's got to be in this area somewhere.''  ''Maybe we should check the street,'' Walling suggested.  He nodded and nosed his car into the alley at the end of the parking lot. He was going to turn left to turn around and go back to the street. But when he checked to see if he was clear on the right, he saw an old white pickup truck with a camper shell parked half a block down the alley next to a green Dumpster. The truck was facing them, and he couldn't tell what make it was.  ''Is that a Toyota?'' he asked.  Walling turned and looked.  ''Bosch, you're a genius,'' she exclaimed.  Bosch turned and drove toward the truck, and as he got closer, he could see that it was indeed a Toyota. So could Walling. She pulled out her phone, but Bosch reached across and put his hand on it.  ''Let's just check it out first. I could be wrong about this.''  ''No, Bosch, you're on a roll.''  But she put the phone away. Bosch pulled slowly past the pickup, giving it a once-over. He then turned around at the end of the block and came back. He stopped his car 10 feet behind it. There was no plate on the back. A cardboard ''Lost Tag'' sign had been put in its place.  Bosch wished he had brought the keys he found in Digiberto Gonzalves's pocket. They got out and approached the truck, coming up on either side of it. When he got close, Bosch noticed that the rear-window hatch of the camper shell had been left open a couple of inches. He reached forward and pulled it up and open all the way. An air-pressure hinge held it open. Bosch leaned in close to look into the interior. It was dark because the truck was parked in shadow and the windows on the shell were darkly tinted.  ''Harry, you have that monitor?''  He pulled her radiation monitor off his belt and held it up in his hand as he leaned into the darkness of the truck's cargo hold. No alarm sounded. He leaned back out and put the monitor back on his belt. He then reached in to the latch and lowered the truck's rear gate.  The back of the truck was piled with junk. There were empty bottles and cans strewn everywhere, a leather desk chair with a broken leg, scrap pieces of aluminum, an old water cooler and other debris. And there by the raised wheel well on the right side was a gray lead container that looked like a small mop bucket on wheels.  ''Is that the pig?'' he asked.  ''I think it is,'' Walling said excitedly. ''I think it is!''  There was no warning sticker on it or radiation-alert symbol. They had been peeled off. Bosch leaned into the truck and grabbed one of the handles. He pulled it clear of the debris around it and rolled it to the tailgate. The top was latched in four places.  ''Do we open it and make sure the stuff is in there?'' he asked.  ''No,'' Walling said. ''We back off and call in the team. They have protection.''  She pulled her phone out again. While she called for the radiation team and backup units Bosch moved to the front of the truck. He looked through the window and into the cab. He saw more junk on the passenger side. His eyes held on a camera that was sitting on an old briefcase with a broken handle on the passenger seat. It didn't appear to be broken or dirty. It looked brand-new.  Bosch checked the door and found it unlocked. He realized that Gonzalves had forgotten about his truck and his possessions when the cesium started burning his body. He had gotten out and stumbled toward the parking lot seeking help, leaving everything behind and unlocked.  Bosch opened the driver's door and reached in with the radiation monitor. Nothing happened. No alert. He replaced it on his belt and walked back to his car. From the equipment kit in the trunk he got out a pair of latex gloves and put them on.  When he walked back past Walling, she was talking to someone about finding the pig. He moved back to the truck's cab. He leaned in and picked up the camera. It was a Nikon digital, and he remembered the lens cap found beneath the master bed at the Kent house by the SID team. He believed he was holding the camera that had taken the photograph of Alice Kent.  Bosch put the camera down and began looking through the things piled on the passenger seat. There was the broken briefcase, a child's lunch box, a manual for operating an Apple computer and a poker from a fireplace tool set. Nothing connected, and nothing interested him. He noticed a golf putter and a rolled-up poster on the floor.  He shifted his weight to one elbow on the armrest between the seats so that he could reach over and open the glove compartment. And there, sitting in the otherwise empty space, was a gun. Bosch lifted it out and turned it in his hand. It was a Smith & Wesson .22-caliber revolver.  ''I think we've got the murder weapon here,'' he called out.  There was no response from Walling. She was still at the back of the truck talking on her phone, now issuing orders in a hurried voice.  Bosch returned the weapon to the glove box and closed it, deciding to leave the weapon in its place for the forensics team. He noticed the poster again and decided for no reason other than curiosity to take a look at it. He unrolled it across all of the junk on the passenger seat. It was a chart depicting 12 yoga positions.  Bosch immediately thought about the discolored space he had seen on the wall in the workout room at the Kent house. He wasn't sure, but he thought the dimensions of the poster would match that space. He quickly rerolled the poster and started to back out of the cab so he could show Walling his discovery.  But as he was pulling out, he noticed that the armrest was also a storage compartment. He stopped and opened it.  He froze. There was a cup holder and in it were several steel capsules resembling bullet cartridges closed flat on both ends. The steel was so polished it almost looked like silver.  Bosch moved the radiation monitor over the capsules in a circular pattern. There was no alarm. He turned the device over in his hand and looked at it. He saw a small switch on its side. With his thumb he pushed it up. A blaring alarm suddenly went off, the frequency of tones so fast that it sounded like one long, ear-piercing siren.  Bosch jumped back out of the truck and slammed the door shut. The poster fell to the ground.  ''Harry!'' Walling yelled. ''What?''  She rushed toward him, closing her phone on her hip. Bosch pushed the switch again and turned the monitor off.  ''What is it?'' she yelled.  Bosch pointed toward the truck's door.  ''The gun's in the glove box and the cesium's in the center compartment.''  ''What?''  ''The cesium is in the compartment under the armrest. He took the capsules out of the pig. That's why they weren't in his pocket. They were in the center armrest.''  He touched his right hip, the place where Gonzalves was burned by radiation. The same spot would have been next to the armrest compartment if he was sitting in the truck.  Rachel didn't say anything for a long moment. She just stared at his face.  ''Are you O.K.?'' she finally asked.  Bosch almost laughed.  ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Ask me in about 10 years.''  She hesitated as if she knew something but couldn't share it.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing. You should be checked out, though.''  ''What are they going to be able to do? Look, I wasn't in the truck that long. It's not like Gonzalves, who was sitting in there with it.''  She didn't answer. Bosch handed her the monitor.  ''It was never on. I thought it was on when you gave it to me.''  She took it and looked at it in her hand.  ''I thought it was, too.''  Bosch looked back at the truck and wondered if he had just hurt or killed himself.  ''I need a drink of water,'' he said. ''I've got a bottle in the trunk.''  Bosch walked to the back of his car. Using the open trunk lid to shield Walling's view of him, he leaned his hands down onto the bumper for support and tried to decipher the messages his body was sending to his brain. He felt something happening but didn't know if it was something physically occurring to him or just the emotional response -- the shakes -- to what had just happened. He suddenly thought of his daughter, getting a vision of her at the airport the last time he saw her.  He cursed out loud.  ''Harry?''  Bosch looked around the trunk lid. Rachel was walking toward him.  ''The teams are headed this way. They'll be here in five minutes. How do you feel?''  ''I think I'm O.K.''  He reached into the trunk and got a liter bottle of water out of his kit. It was an emergency bottle he kept for surveillances that dragged on longer than expected. He opened it and took two strong pulls. The water wasn't cold, but it felt good going down. His throat was dry.  Bosch recapped the bottle and put it back in the kit. He stepped around the car to Walling. As he walked toward her he looked past her to the south. He realized that the alley they were in extended several blocks past the back of the Easy Print and ran behind all the storefronts and offices on Cahuenga. All the way down to Barham.  Every 20 yards or so there was a green Dumpster positioned perpendicular to the rear of the structures. Bosch realized that the Dumpsters had been pushed out of spaces between the buildings and fenced corrals. It was pickup day, and the Dumpsters were waiting for the city trucks to come.  Suddenly it all came to him. Like fusion. Like two elements coming together and creating a new element. It all came together for Bosch in that moment. The thing that bothered him about the photos, the yoga poster, everything. The gamma rays had shot right through him, but they had left him enlightened. He knew. He understood.  ''He's a scavenger.''  ''Who is?''  ''Digiberto Gonzalves,'' Bosch said, his eyes looking down the alley. ''It's collection day. The Dumpsters are all pushed out for the city trucks. Gonzalves is a scavenger, a Dumpster diver, and he knew they would be out and this would be a good time to come here. ...  ''And so did somebody else.''  ''You mean he found the cesium in a Dumpster?''  Bosch nodded and pointed down the alley.  ''All the way at the end, that's Barham. Barham takes you up to Lake Hollywood. Lake Hollywood takes you to the overlook. This case never leaves the page.''  Walling came over and stood in front of him, blocking his view. Bosch could hear sirens in the distance.  ''What are you saying? That Nassar and Elfayed took the cesium and stashed it in a Dumpster at the bottom of the hill? Then this scavenger comes along and finds it?''  ''I'm saying you've got the cesium back, so now we're looking at this as a homicide again. You come down from the overlook, and you can be in this alley in five minutes.''  ''So what? They stole the cesium and killed Kent just so they could come down here and stash it? Is that what you're saying? Or are you saying they just threw it all away? Why would they do that? I mean, does that make any sense at all?''  Bosch noted that she had asked six questions at once this time, possibly a new record.  ''Nassar and Elfayed were never near the cesium,'' he said. ''That's what I'm saying.''  He walked over to the truck and picked the poster up off the ground. He handed it to Rachel. The sirens were getting louder.  She unrolled the poster in her hands and looked at it.  ''What is this? What does it mean?''  Bosch took it back from her and started rolling it back up.  ''Gonzalves found that in the same Dumpster he found the gun and the camera and the lead pig.''  ''So? What does it mean, Harry?''  Two fed cars pulled into the alley a block away and started making their way toward them, weaving around the Dumpsters pushed out for pickup. As they got close, Bosch could see that the driver of the lead car was Jack Brenner.  ''Do you hear me, Harry? What does it --''  Bosch's knees suddenly seemed to give out and he fell into her, throwing his arms around her to stop himself from hitting the ground.  ''Bosch!''  She grabbed on and held him.  ''Uh ... I'm not feeling so good,'' he mumbled. ''I think I better. ... Can you take me to my car?''  She helped him straighten up and then started walking him toward his car. He put his arm over her shoulders. Car doors were slamming behind them as the agents got out.  ''Where are the keys?'' Walling asked.  He held the key ring up to her just as Brenner ran up to them.  ''What is it? What's wrong?''  ''He was exposed. The cesium is in the center console in the truck cab. Be careful. I'm going to take him to the hospital.''  Brenner stepped back, as if whatever Bosch had was contagious.  ''O.K.,'' he said. ''Call me when you can.''  Bosch and Walling kept moving toward the car.  ''Come on, Bosch,'' Walling said. ''Stay with me. Hang in there and we'll get you taken care of.''  Bosch almost smiled. She had called him by his last name.  Next week: Reeling from exposure, Bosch fingers the wrong man.

            "text": "  Bosch has found the radiation victim's Toyota in an alley not far from the overlook, and inside it, many objects asociated with Stanley Kent's murder, particularly the cesium. In the process, however, Bosch, too, has been exposed to the radiation.  The car jerked forward as Walling pulled out of the alley and into southbound traffic on Cahuenga.  ''I'm taking you back to Queen of Angels so Dr. Gardner can have a look at you,'' she said. ''Just hang in there for me, Bosch.''  He knew that the last-name endearments were probably about to come to an end. He pointed toward the left-turn lane that led onto Barham Boulevard.  ''Never mind the hospital,'' he said. ''Take me back to the Kent house.''  ''What?''  ''I'll get checked out later. Go to the Kent house. Here's the turn.''  She slipped into the left-turn lane.  ''What are you telling me, that that little fainting spell back there was -- ''  ''I had to get you away from the crime scene and away from Brenner so I could check this out and talk to you.''  ''Check what out? Talk about what? Do you realize what you just did? I thought I was saving your life. Now Brenner or one of those other guys will take the credit for the recovery. Thanks a lot. That was my crime scene.''  He opened his jacket and pulled out the rolled and folded-over yoga poster.  ''Don't worry about it,'' he said. ''You can get the credit for the arrests. You just might not want it.''  He opened the poster, letting the top half flop over his knees. He was interested in only the bottom half.  ''Dhanurasana,'' he said.  Walling glanced over at him and then down at the poster.  ''Would you start telling me what's going on?''  ''Alice Kent practices yoga. I saw the mats in the workout room at the house.''  ''I saw them, too. So what?''  ''Did you see the sun discoloration on the wall where a picture or a calendar or maybe a poster had been taken down?''  ''Yes, I saw it.''  Bosch held up the poster.  ''I'm betting that we go in there and this will be a perfect fit. This is a poster Gonzalves found with the cesium.''  ''And what will that mean -- if it's a perfect fit?''  ''It will mean Alice Kent conspired to kill her husband, and if it hadn't been for Digiberto Gonzalves, it would have been a perfect crime.''  Walling shook her head dismissively.  ''Come on, Harry. Are you saying she conspired with international terrorists to kill her husband in exchange for the cesium? I can't believe I am even doing this. I need to get back to the crime scene.''  She started checking her mirrors, getting ready to make a U-turn. They were going up Lake Hollywood Drive now and would be at the house in two minutes.  ''No, keep going. We're almost there. Alice Kent conspired with someone, but it wasn't a terrorist. The cesium being dumped in the trash proves that. You said it yourself, there is no way that Moby and Elfayed would steal this stuff to just dump it. So what does that tell you? This wasn't a heist. It actually was a murder. The cesium was just a red herring. Moby and Elfayed? They were part of the misdirection. And this poster will help prove it.''  ''How?''  ''Dhanurasana, the rocking bow.''  He held the poster up so she could glance at the yoga pose depicted in the bottom corner. It showed a woman with her arms behind her back, holding her ankles and creating a bow with the front of her body. She looked as if she were hogtied.  Walling glanced back at the curving road and then took another long look at the poster and the pose.  ''We go into the house and see if this fits that space on the wall,'' Bosch said. ''If it fits, that means she and the killer took it off the wall because they didn't want to risk that we might see it and connect it with what happened to her.''  ''It's a stretch, Harry. A huge one.''  ''Not when you put it in context.''  ''Which you, of course, can do.''  ''As soon as we get to the house.''  ''Hope you still have a key.''  ''You bet I do.''  Walling turned onto Arrowhead Drive and punched the accelerator. But after a block she took her foot off, slowed down and shook her head again.  ''This is ridiculous. She gave us the name Moby. There is no way she could have known he was in this country. And then up on the overlook, your own witness said that the shooter called out to Allah as he pulled the trigger. How can -- ''  ''Let's try the poster on the wall. If it fits, I'll lay the whole thing out for you. I promise. If it doesn't fit, then I will quit bothering you with it.''  She relented and drove the remaining block to the Kent house without another word. There was no longer a bureau car sitting out front. Bosch guessed that it was all hands on deck at the cesium-recovery scene.  ''Thank God I don't have to deal with Maxwell again,'' he said.  Walling didn't even smile.  Bosch got out with the poster and his file containing the crime-scene photos. He used Stanley Kent's keys to open the front door, and they proceeded to the workout room. They took positions on either side of the rectangular discoloration, and Bosch unrolled the poster. They each took a side and held the top corners of the poster to the top corners of the mark. Bosch put his other hand on the center of the poster and flattened it against the wall. The poster was a perfect fit.  Rachel immediately let go of her side and headed out of the room.  ''I'll be in the living room. I can't wait to hear you put this together.''  Bosch rolled the poster up and followed. Walling took a seat in the same chair Bosch put Maxwell in a few hours earlier. He remained standing in front of her.  ''The fear was that the poster could be a tip-off,'' he said. ''Some smart agent or detective would see the rocking-bow pose and start thinking, This woman does yoga, maybe she could handle being hogtied like that. Maybe it was her idea, maybe she did it to help sell the misdirection. So they couldn't take the chance. The poster had to go. It went into the Dumpster with the cesium, the gun and everything else they used. If you get your people out there to check that line of Dumpsters, you'll find the rest -- the Coke-bottle silencer, the ski mask, the gloves, the first set of snap ties, every -- ''  ''The first set of snap ties?''  ''That's right. I'll get to that.''  Walling looked unimpressed.  ''You better get to a lot of it. Because there are big gaps in this thing, man. What about the name Moby? What about the citing of Allah by the shooter? What -- ''  Bosch held up a hand.  ''Just hold on,'' he said. ''I need some water. My throat is raw from all of this talking.''  He went into the kitchen, remembering that he saw bottles of chilled water in the refrigerator while searching the kitchen earlier.  ''You want anything?'' he called out.  ''No,'' she called back. ''It's not our house, remember?''  He opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle of water and drank half of it while standing in front of the open door. He then went back out to the living room, where Rachel was waiting for the story. Once again, he remained standing.  ''O.K., when was it that you captured the terrorist known as Moby on video at the port?''  ''What does -- ''  ''Please, just answer the question.''  ''Aug. 12.''  ''O.K., Aug. 12. Then what, some sort of alert went out through the bureau and Homeland Security?''  She nodded.  ''Not for a while, though,'' she said. ''It took almost a month of video analysis to confirm it was Nassar and Elfayed. I wrote the bulletin. It went out Sept. 9 as a confirmed domestic sighting.''  ''Out of curiosity, why didn't you go public with it?''  ''Because we have -- actually, I can't tell you.''  ''You just did. You must have someone or someplace where you think these two might show up under surveillance. If you go public, they might just go underground and never show up again.''  ''Can we go back to your story, please?''  ''Fine. So the bulletin went out Sept. 9. That was the day the plan to kill Stanley Kent began.''  Walling folded her arms across her chest and just stared at him. Bosch thought that maybe she was beginning to see where he was going with the story, and she didn't like it.  ''It works best if you start from the end and go backward,'' Bosch said. ''She gave you the name Moby. How could she have gotten that name?''  ''She overheard one of them calling the other one that name.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''No, she told you she overheard it. But if she was lying, how would she know the name to lie about it? Just coincidence that she gives the nickname of a guy who was just discovered in the country -- in L.A. County, no less? I don't think so, Rachel, and neither do you.''  ''O.K., so you're saying that somebody in the bureau or another agency that received the F.B.I. bulletin gave her the name.''  ''That's right. He gave her the name so she could come out with it while being questioned by the F.B.I.'s master interrogator. That one name would then send this whole thing down the wrong road with the F.B.I. and everybody else chasing after terrorists who had nothing to do with it.''  ''He?''  ''I'm getting to that now. You are right, anybody who got a look at that bulletin would have been able to give her that name. My guess is that would be a lot of people. A lot of people just in L.A. alone. So how would we narrow it down to one?''  ''You tell me.''  Bosch opened the bottle and drank the rest of the water. He held the empty bottle in his hand as he continued.  ''You narrow it down by continuing to go backward. Where would Alice Kent's life have intersected with one of those people in the agencies who knew about Moby?''  ''That could be anywhere with those kind of parameters. It could've happened when she was buying fertilizer for her roses.''  ''Then narrow the parameters. Where would she have intersected with someone who knew about Moby but also knew that her husband had access to the sort of radioactive materials Moby might be interested in?''  She shook her head in a disdainful way.  ''Nowhere. It would take a monumental coincidence to -- ''  She stopped when it came to her. There was enlightenment and shock as she fully understood where Bosch was going.  ''My partner and I visited the Kents to warn them a year ago. I guess what you're saying is that that makes me a suspect.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''I said 'he,' remember? You didn't come here alone.''  Her eyes fired when she registered the implication.  ''That's ridiculous. There's no way. I can't believe you would. . . . ''  She didn't finish, as her mind snagged on something, some memory or tell that undermined her trust and loyalty to her partner.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing.''  ''What?''  ''Look,'' she insisted, ''take my advice and tell no one this theory of yours. You're lucky you told me first. Because this makes you sound like some kind of crackpot with a vendetta. You have no evidence, no motive, no incriminating statements, nothing. You just have this thing you've spun out of . . . out of a yoga poster.''  ''There is no other explanation that fits with the facts. And I'm talking about the facts of the case. Not the fact that the bureau and Homeland Security and the rest of the federal government would love this to be a terrorism event so they can justify their existence and deflect criticism from other failings. Contrary to what you want to think, there is evidence and there are incriminating statements. If we put Alice Kent on a lie detector, you'll find out that everything she told me, you and the master interrogator downtown is a lie.''  Walling leaned forward and looked down at the floor.  ''That master interrogator you love deriding happened to be me.''  Bosch's mouth dropped open for a moment before he spoke.  ''Oh . . . well . . . then, sorry . . . but it doesn't matter. The point is, she is a master liar. She lied about everything, and now that we know the story, it will be easy to smoke her out.''  Walling got up from her seat and walked over to the front picture window. The vertical blinds were closed, but she split them with a finger and stared out into the street. Bosch could see her working the story over, grinding it down.  ''What about the witness?'' she asked without turning around. ''He heard the shooter yell, 'Allah.' Are you saying he's part of this?''  Now Bosch sat down and gently tried to clear his throat. It was burning and getting difficult to talk.  ''No, on that I think it's just a lesson in hearing what you want to hear. I plead guilty to not being much of a master interrogator myself. The kid told me that he heard the shooter yell it as he pulled the trigger. He said he wasn't sure but that it sounded like 'Allah,' and that, of course, worked with what I was thinking at the time.''  Walling came away from the window and sat down across from him. She folded her arms again. Bosch continued.  ''But how would he know it was the shooter and not the victim who yelled? He was more than 50 yards away. It was dark. How would he know that it wasn't Stanley Kent yelling out his last word before execution? The name of the woman he loved because he was about to die not even knowing that she'd betrayed him in the worst way.''  ''Alice.''  ''Exactly.''  Walling relaxed her arms and leaned forward. As body language went, it was a good sign. It told Bosch he was pushing through.  ''You said 'the first set of snap ties' before,'' she said. ''What were you talking about?''  Bosch nodded and handed her the file containing the crime-scene photos. He had saved the best for last.  ''Look at the photos,'' he said. ''What do you see?''  She opened the file and started looking at them. They depicted the master bedroom in the Kent house from all angles.  ''It's the master bedroom,'' she said. ''What am I missing?''  ''Exactly.''  ''What?''  ''It's what you don't see. There are no clothes in the shot. She told us they told her to take off her clothes and get on the bed. What are we supposed to believe, that they let her put the clothes away before they hogtied her? They let her put them in the hamper? Look at the last shot. It's the e-mail photo Stanley Kent got.''  Walling looked through the file until she found the printout of the photo. She stared intently at it. He saw recognition break in her eyes.  ''Now what do you see?''  ''The robe,'' she said excitedly. ''When we let her get dressed, she went to the closet to get her robe. There was no robe on that lounge chair!''  Bosch nodded, and they started trading the story back and forth.  ''What does that tell us?'' he asked. ''That these considerate terrorists hung the robe up in the closet for her after taking the photo?''  ''Or that maybe Mrs. Kent was tied up twice and the robe was moved in between?''  ''And look again at the picture. The clock on the bedside table is unplugged.''  ''Why?''  ''I don't know, but maybe they didn't want to worry about having any sort of time stamp on the photo. Maybe the first photo wasn't even taken yesterday. Maybe it came from a dry run two days ago or two weeks.''  Rachel nodded, and Bosch knew she was a believer.  ''She was tied up once for the photo and then once again for the rescue,'' she said.  ''Exactly. And that left her free to help carry out the plan on the overlook. She didn't kill her husband, but she was up there in the other car. And once Stanley was dead and the car was ditched and the cesium dumped, she and her partner came back home, and she was tied up all over again.''  ''She wasn't passed out when we got there,'' Walling said. ''That was an act and part of the plan. And her wetting the bed was a nice little touch to help sell it to us.''  There was no doubt now. Bosch had her. But then the shadow of concern and doubt moved across her face like a summer cloud.  ''What about motive?'' she asked. ''This is a federal agent we're talking about. To move on this we need everything, even motive. There can be nothing left open to chance.''  Bosch had been ready for the question.  ''You saw the motive. Alice Kent is a beautiful woman. Jack Brenner wanted her, and Stanley Kent was in the way of that.''  Walling's eyes widened in shock. Bosch pressed on with his case.  ''That's the motive, Rachel. You -- ''  ''But he -- ''  ''Let me just finish. It goes like this. You and your partner show up here that day last year to give the Kents the warning about his occupation. Some kind of vibe is exchanged between Alice and Jack. He gets interested, she gets interested. They meet on the sly for coffee or drinks or whatever. One thing leads to another. An affair begins, and it lasts, and then it lasts to the point that it's time to start thinking about doing something. Leaving the husband. Or getting rid of him because there's insurance and half a company at stake. That's enough motive right there, Rachel, and that's what this case is about. It's not about cesium or terrorism or anything else. It's sex and murder. That's all.''  She frowned and shook her head.  ''You don't know what you are talking about. Jack Brenner is married and has three children. That's why I wanted him as a partner. He's stable, boring and not interested. He wasn't -- ''  ''Every man is interested. It doesn't matter if they're married or how many kids they have.''  She spoke quietly.  ''Would you listen and let me finish now? You are wrong about Brenner. He never met Alice Kent before today. He wasn't my partner when I came here last year, and I never told you he was.''  Bosch was jolted by the news. He'd assumed that her current partner was her partner last year. He'd had Brenner's image locked and loaded in his mind as he had spun the story.  ''Then who was your partner?'' he asked.  ''I switched partners and hooked up with Jack after the start of the year. Basically, I was tired of my old partner coming on to me. I wanted to move on.''  ''Who was it, Rachel?''  She held his eyes for a long moment.  ''It was Cliff Maxwell.''

            "text": "  Sometimes I feel that living in New York City, having a good family and friends, and just being alive is a dream, that perhaps this second life of mine isn't really happening. Whenever I speak at the United Nations, Unicef or elsewhere to raise awareness of the continual and rampant recruitment of children in wars around the world, I come to realize that I still do not fully understand how I could have possibly survived the civil war in my country, Sierra Leone.  Most of my friends, after meeting the woman whom I think of as my new mother, a Brooklyn-born white Jewish-American, assume that I was either adopted at a very young age or that my mother married an African man. They would never imagine that I was 17 when I came to live with her and that I had been a child soldier and participated in one of the most brutal wars in recent history.  In early 1993, when I was 12, I was separated from my family as the Sierra Leone civil war, which began two years earlier, came into my life. The rebel army, known as the Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F.), attacked my town in the southern part of the country. I ran away, along paths and roads that were littered with dead bodies, some mutilated in ways so horrible that looking at them left a permanent scar on my memory. I ran for days, weeks and months, and I couldn't believe that the simple and precious world I had known, where nights were celebrated with storytelling and dancing and mornings greeted with the singing of birds and cock crows, was now a place where only guns spoke and sometimes it seemed even the sun hesitated to shine. After I discovered that my parents and two brothers had been killed, I felt even more lost and worthless in a world that had become pregnant with fear and suspicion as neighbor turned against neighbor and child against parent. Surviving each passing minute was nothing short of a miracle.  After almost a year of running, I, along with some friends I met along the way, arrived at an army base in the southeastern region. We thought we were now safe; little did we know what lay ahead.  1994: The First Battle  I have never been so afraid to go anywhere in my life as I was that first day. As we walked into the arms of the forest, tears began to form in my eyes, but I struggled to hide them and gripped my gun for comfort. We exhaled quietly, afraid that our own breathing could cause our deaths. The lieutenant led the line that I was in. He raised his fist in the air, and we stopped moving. Then he slowly brought it down, and we sat on one heel, our eyes surveying the forest. We began to move swiftly among the bushes until we came to the edge of a swamp, where we formed an ambush, aiming our guns into the bog. We lay flat on our stomachs and waited. I was lying next to my friend Josiah. At 11, he was even younger than I was. Musa, a friend my age, 13, was also nearby. I looked around to see if I could catch their eyes, but they were concentrating on the invisible target in the swamp. The tops of my eyes began to ache, and the pain slowly rose up to my head. My ears became warm, and tears were running down my cheeks, even though I wasn't crying. The veins on my arms stood out, and I could feel them pulsating as if they had begun to breathe of their own accord. We waited in the quiet, as hunters do. The silence tormented me.  The short trees in the swamp began to shake as the rebels made their way through them. They weren't yet visible, but the lieutenant had passed the word down through a whisper that was relayed like a row of falling dominos: ''Fire on my command.'' As we watched, a group of men dressed in civilian clothes emerged from under the tiny bushes. They waved their hands, and more fighters came out. Some were boys, as young as we were. They sat together in line, waving their hands, discussing a strategy. My lieutenant ordered a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) to be fired, but the commander of the rebels heard it as it whooshed its way out of the forest. ''Retreat!'' he called out to his men, and the grenade's blast got only a few rebels, whose split bodies flew in the air. The explosion was followed by an exchange of gunfire from both sides.  I lay there with my gun pointed in front of me, unable to shoot. My index finger became numb. I felt as if the forest had turned upside down and I was going to fall off, so I clutched the base of a tree with one hand. I couldn't think, but I could hear the sounds of the guns far away in the distance and the cries of people dying in pain. A splash of blood hit my face. In my reverie I had opened my mouth a bit, so I tasted some of the blood. As I spat it out and wiped it off my face, I saw the soldier it had come from. Blood poured out of the bullet holes in him like water rushing through newly opened tributaries. His eyes were wide open; he still held his gun. My eyes were fixed on him when I heard Josiah screaming for his mother in the most painfully piercing voice I had ever heard. It vibrated inside my head to the point that I felt my brain had shaken loose from its anchor.  I searched for Josiah. An RPG had tossed his tiny body off the ground, and he had landed on a tree stump. He wiggled his legs as his cry gradually came to an end. There was blood everywhere. It seemed as if bullets were falling into the forest from all angles. I crawled to Josiah and looked into his eyes. There were tears in them, and his lips were shaking, but he couldn't speak. As I watched him, the water in his eyes was replaced with blood that quickly turned his brown eyes red. He reached for my shoulder as if to pull himself up. But midway, he stopped moving. The gunshots faded in my head, and it was as if my heart had stopped and the whole world had come to a standstill. I covered his eyes with my fingers and lifted him from the tree stump. His backbone had been shattered. I placed him flat on the ground and picked up my gun. I didn't realize that I had stood up to take Josiah off the tree stump. I felt someone tugging at my foot. It was the corporal; he was saying something that I couldn't understand. His mouth moved, and he looked terrified. He pulled me down, and as I hit the ground, I felt my brain shaking in my skull again, and my deafness gave way.  ''Get down,'' he was screaming. ''Shoot,'' he said, as he crawled away from me to resume his position. As I looked to where he lay, my eyes caught Musa, whose head was covered with blood. His hands looked too relaxed. I turned toward the swamp, where there were gunmen running, trying to cross over. My face, my hands, my shirt and my gun were drenched in blood. I raised my gun and pulled the trigger, and I killed a man. Suddenly all the death I had seen since the day I was touched by war began flashing in my head. Every time I stopped shooting to change magazines and saw my two lifeless friends, I angrily pointed my gun into the swamp and killed more people. I shot everything that moved, until we were ordered to retreat because we needed another plan.  We took the guns and ammunition off the bodies of my friends and left them there in the forest, which had taken on a life of its own, as if it had trapped the souls that had departed from the dead. The branches of the trees seemed to be holding hands and bowing their heads in prayer. In the swamp, crabs had already begun feasting on the eyes of the dead. Limbs and fragmented skulls lay on top of the bog, and the water in the swamp was stagnant with blood. I was not afraid of these lifeless bodies. I despised them and kicked them to flip them and take their guns. I found a G3 and some ammunition. I noticed that most of the dead gunmen and boys wore lots of jewelry on their necks and wrists.  We arrived in the village, our base, with nightfall and sat against the walls of houses. It was quiet, and perhaps afraid of the silence, we began cleaning the blood off our guns, oiling their chambers, and shooting them into the air to test their effectiveness. I went for supper that night but was unable to eat. I only drank water and felt nothing. I lay on my back in the tent with my AK-47 on my chest and the G3 I had taken from a dead rebel leaning on the peg of the tent. Nothing happened in my head. It was a void, and I stared at the roof of the tent until I was miraculously able to doze off. I had a dream that I was picking up Josiah from the tree stump and a gunman stood on top of me. He placed his gun against my forehead. I immediately woke up from my dream and began shooting inside the tent, until the 30 rounds in the magazine were finished. The corporal and the lieutenant came in afterward and took me outside. I was sweating, and they threw water on my face and gave me a few white capsules. They were the same capsules that we'd all been given before we had gone into battle, and to this day, I do not know what they contained. I stayed up all night and couldn't sleep for days. We went out two more times that week, and I had no problem shooting my gun.  Rebel Raids  After that first week of going out on raids to kill people we deemed our rebel enemies or sympathizers of the rebels, our initiation was complete. We stayed put at the base, and we boys took turns guarding posts around the village. We smoked marijuana and sniffed ''brown brown,'' cocaine mixed with gunpowder, which was always spread out on a table near the ammunition hut, and of course I took more of the white capsules, as I had become addicted to them. The first time I took all these drugs at the same time, I began to perspire so much that I took off all my clothes. My body shook, my sight became blurred and I lost my hearing for several minutes. I walked around the village restlessly. But after several doses of these drugs, all I felt was numbness to everything and so much energy that I couldn't sleep for weeks. We watched war movies at night, Rambo ''First Blood,'' ''Rambo, First Blood, Part II,'' ''Commando'' and so on, with the aid of a generator or a car battery. We all wanted to be like Rambo; we couldn't wait to implement his techniques.  When we ran out of supplies, we raided rebel camps in towns, villages and forests. ''We have good news from our informants'' the lieutenant would announce. ''We are moving out in five minutes to kill some rebels and take their supplies, which really belong to us.'' He often made speeches about how we were defending our country, how honorable we were. At these times, I would stand holding my gun and feeling special because I was part of something that took me seriously and I was not running from anyone anymore. The lieutenant's face evinced confidence; his smiles disappeared before they were completed. We would tie our heads with the green cloths that distinguished us from the rebels, and we boys would lead the way. There were no maps and no questions asked. We were simply told to follow the path until we received instructions on what to do next. We walked for long hours and stopped only to eat sardines and corned beef with gari, sniff brown brown and take more white capsules. The combination of these drugs made us fierce. The idea of death didn't cross my mind, and killing had become as easy as drinking water. After that first killing, my mind had stopped making remorseful records, or so it seemed.  Before we got to a rebel camp, we would deviate from the path and walk in the forest. Once the camp was in sight, we would surround it and wait for the lieutenant's command. The rebels roamed about; some sat against walls, dozing off, and others, boys as young as we, stood at guard posts passing around marijuana. Whenever I looked at rebels during raids, my entire body shook with fury; they were the people who had shot my friends and family. So when the lieutenant gave orders, I shot as many as I could, but I didn't feel better. After every gunfight, we would enter the rebel camp, killing those we had wounded. We would then search the houses and gather gallons of gasoline, enormous amounts of marijuana and cocaine, bales of clothes, watches, rice, salt, gari and many other things. We rounded up any civilians -- men, women, boys and young girls -- hiding in the huts and houses and made them carry our loot back to the base. We shot them if they tried to run away.  On one of these raids, we captured a few rebels after a long gunfight and a lot of civilian casualties. We undressed the prisoners and tied their arms behind their backs until their chests were tight as drums. ''Where did you get all this ammunition from?'' the corporal asked one of the prisoners, a man with an almost dreadlocked beard. He spat in the corporal's face, and the corporal immediately shot him in the head at close range. He fell to the ground, and blood slowly leaked out of his head. We cheered in admiration of the corporal's action and saluted him as he walked by. Suddenly, a rebel hiding in the bushes shot one of our boys. We dispersed around the village in search of the shooter. When the young muscular rebel was captured, the lieutenant slit his neck with his bayonet. The rebel ran before he fell to the ground and stopped moving. We cheered again, raising our guns in the air, shouting and whistling.  During that time, a lot of things were done with no reason or explanation. Sometimes we were asked to leave for war in the middle of a movie. We would come back hours later after killing many people and continue the movie as if we had just returned from intermission. We were always either on the front lines, watching a war movie or doing drugs. There was no time to be alone or to think. When we conversed with one another, we talked only about the movies and how impressed we were with the way either the lieutenant, the corporal or one of us had killed someone. It was as if nothing else existed.  The villages that we captured and turned into our bases as we went along and the forests that we slept in became my home. My squad was my family, my gun was my provider and protector and my rule was to kill or be killed. The extent of my thoughts didn't go much beyond that. We had been fighting for more than two years, and killing had become a daily activity. I felt no pity for anyone. My childhood had gone by without my knowing, and it seemed as if my heart had frozen. I knew that day and night came and went because of the presence of the moon and the sun, but I had no idea whether it was a Sunday or a Friday.  Taken From the Front  In my head my life was normal. But everything began to change in January 1996. I was 15.  One morning that month, a truck came to the village where we were based. Four men dressed in clean blue jeans and white T-shirts that said ''Unicef'' in big blue letters jumped out. They were shown to the lieutenant's house. It seemed as if he had been expecting them. As they sat talking on the veranda, we watched them from under the mango tree, where we sat cleaning our guns. Soon all the boys were told to line up for the lieutenant who selected a few of us and asked the adult soldiers to take away our guns and ammunition. A bunch of boys, including my friend Alhaji and me, were ushered to the truck. I stared back at the veranda where the lieutenant now stood, looking in the other direction, toward the forest, his hands crossed behind his back. I still didn't know exactly what was going on, but I was beginning to get angry and anxious. Why had the lieutenant decided to give us up to these civilians? We thought that we were part of the war until the end.  We were on the road for hours. I had gotten used to always moving and hadn't sat in one place idly for a long time. It was night when the truck stopped at a center, where there were other boys whose appearances, red eyes and somber faces resembled ours. Alhaji and I looked at this group, and he asked the boys who they were. A boy who was sitting on the stoop angrily said: ''We fought for the R.U.F.; the army is the enemy. We fought for freedom, and the army killed my family and destroyed my village. I will kill any of those army bastards every time I get a chance to do so.'' The boy took off his shirt to fight, and on his arm was the R.U.F. brand. Mambu, one of the boys on our side, shouted, ''They are rebels,'' and reached for his bayonet, which he had hidden in his army shorts; most of us had hidden either a knife or a grenade before our guns were taken from us. Before Mambu could grab his weapon, the R.U.F. boy punched him in the face. He fell, and when he got up, his nose was bleeding. The rebel boys drew out the few bayonets they had in their shorts and rushed toward us. It was war all over again. Perhaps the na\u00efve men who had taken us to the center thought that removing us from the war would lessen our hatred for the R.U.F. It hadn't crossed their minds that a change of environment wouldn't immediately make us normal boys; we were dangerous, brainwashed to kill.  One boy grabbed my neck from behind. He was squeezing for the kill, and I couldn't use my bayonet effectively, so I elbowed him with all my might until he let go. He was holding his stomach when I turned around and stabbed him in his foot. The bayonet stuck, so I pulled it out with force. He fell, and I began kicking him in the face. As I went to deliver the final blow with my bayonet, someone came from behind me and sliced my hand with his knife. It was a rebel boy, and he was about to kick me down when he fell on his face. Alhaji had stabbed him in the back. He pulled the knife out, and we started kicking the boy until he stopped moving. I wasn't sure whether he was unconscious or dead. I didn't care. No one screamed or cried during the fight. After all, we had been doing such things for years and were all still on drugs.  We continued to stab and slice one another until a bunch of MPs came running through the gate toward the fight. The MPs fired a few rounds into the air to get us to stop, but we were still fighting, so they had to part us by force. They placed some of us at gunpoint and kicked others apart. Six people were killed: two on our side and four on the rebel side.  As MPs stood guard to make sure we didn't start another fight, we, the army boys, went to the kitchen to look for food. We ate and chatted about the fight. Mambu told us that he had plucked an eye out of the head of one of the R.U.F. boys, and that the boy ran to punch him, but he couldn't see, so he ran into the wall, banging his head hard and fainting. We laughed and picked up Mambu, raising him in the air. We needed the violence to cheer us after a whole day of boring travel and contemplation about why our superiors had let us go.  That night we were moved to a rehabilitation center called Benin Home. Benin Home was run by a local NGO called Children Associated With the War, in Kissy neighborhood, on the eastern outskirts of Freetown, the capital. This time, the MPs made sure to search us thoroughly before we entered. The blood of our victims and enemies was fresh on our arms and clothes. My lieutenant's words still echoed in my head: ''From now on, we kill any rebel we see, no prisoners.'' I smiled a bit, happy that we had taken care of the rebel boys, but I also began to wonder again: Why had we been taken here? I walked up and down on the veranda, restless in my new environment. My head began to hurt.  Relearning Boyhood  It was infuriating to be told what to do by civilians. Their voices, even when they called us for breakfast, enraged me so much that I would punch the wall, my locker or anything nearby. A few days earlier, we could have decided whether they would live or die.  We refused to do anything that we were asked to do, except eat. At the end of every meal, the staff members and nurses came to talk to us about attending the scheduled medical checkups and the one-on-one counseling sessions that we hated at the minihospital that was part of Benin Home. As soon as the live-in staff, mostly men, started telling us what to do, we would throw bowls, spoons, food and benches at them. We would chase them out of the dining hall and beat them. One afternoon, after we had chased off several staff members, we placed a bucket over the cook's head and pushed him around the kitchen until he burned his hand on a boiling pot and agreed to put more milk in our tea. During that same week, the drugs were wearing off. I craved cocaine and marijuana so badly that I would roll a plain sheet of paper and smoke it. Sometimes I searched the pockets of my army shorts, which I still wore, for crumbs of marijuana or cocaine. We broke into the minihospital and stole some painkillers -- white tablets and off-white -- and red and yellow capsules. We emptied the capsules, ground the tablets and mixed them together. But the mixture didn't give us the effect we wanted. We got more upset day by day and, as a result, resorted to more violence. We began to fight one another day and night. We would fight for hours for no reason at all. At first the staff would intervene, but after a while they just let us go. They couldn't really stop us, and perhaps they thought that we would get this out of our systems. During these fights, we destroyed most of the furniture and threw the mattresses out in the yard. We would stop to wipe the blood off our lips, arms and legs only when the bell rang for mealtime.  It had been more than a month, and some of us had almost gone through the withdrawal stage, even though there were still instances of vomiting and collapsing at unexpected moments. These outbreaks ended, for most of us, at the end of the second month. But we now had time to think; the fastened mantle of our war memories slowly began to open. We resorted to more violence to avoid summoning thoughts of our recent lives.  Whenever I turned on the faucet, all I could see was blood gushing out. I would stare at it until it looked like water before drinking or taking a shower. Boys sometimes ran out of the hall screaming, ''The rebels are coming.'' Other times, the younger ones sat weeping and telling us that nearby rocks were their dead families.  It took several months before I began to relearn how to sleep without the aid of medicine. But even when I was finally able to fall asleep, I would start awake less than an hour later. I would dream that a faceless gunman had tied me up and begun to slit my throat with the zigzag edge of his bayonet. I would feel the pain that the knife inflicted as the man sawed my neck. I'd wake up sweating and throwing punches in the air. I would run outside to the middle of the soccer field, sit on a stone and rock back and forth, my arms wrapped around my legs. I would try desperately to think about my childhood, but I couldn't. The fighting memories seemed to have formed a barrier that I had to break in order to think about any moment before the war. On those mornings, I would feel one of the staff members wrap a blanket around me, saying: ''This isn't your fault, you know. It really isn't. You'll get through this.'' He would then pull me up and walk me back to the hall.  Past and Present  One day after I'd been in Benin Home for more than three months, I was sent to the minihospital for a checkup. The nurse on duty was named Esther. I had met her once before when I was sent to the minihospital after cutting my hand punching a window. Esther wore a white uniform and a white hat. Her white teeth contrasted with her dark, shiny skin, and when she smiled, her face glowed. She was tall and had big brown eyes that were kind and inviting. She must have been about 30, which I thought was too old.  That day, before Esther examined me, she gave me a present, a Walkman and a Run-DMC tape. I used to listen to rap music a lot before the war and loved it because of its poetic use of words. I put the headphones on and didn't mind being examined because the song had taken hold of me, and I listened closely to every word. But when she began examining my legs and saw the nasty scars on my left shin, she took my headphones off and asked, ''How did you get these scars?''  ''Bullet wounds,'' I casually replied.  Her face filled with sorrow, and her voice was shaking when she spoke: ''You have to tell me what happened so I can prescribe treatment.'' At first I was reluctant, but she said she would be able to treat me effectively only if I told her what happened, especially about how my bullet wounds were treated. So I told her the whole story not because I really wanted to but because I thought that if I told her some of the truth of my war years, she would be afraid of me and would cease asking questions. She listened attentively when I began to talk:  During the second dry season of my war years, we were low on food and ammunition. So as usual, we decided to attack another village, which was a three-day walk away. We left our base that evening, stopping once a day to eat, drink and take drugs. Each of us had two guns, one strapped to our backs, the other held in our hands. On the evening of the third day, the village was in sight.  Surrounding it, we waited for the lieutenant's command. As we lay in ambush, we began to realize that the place was empty. We were beginning to suspect that something was amiss when a shot was fired from behind us. It was clear now: we were being ambushed. We ended up in a fight that lasted more than 24 hours. We lost several men and boys. When we finally seemed to have captured the village, we began to look around for anything we could find. I was filling my backpack with ammunition from a hut when bullets began to rain on the village again. I was hit three times in my left shin. The first two bullets went in and out, and the last one stayed inside. I couldn't walk, so I lay on the ground and released an entire round of the magazine into the bush where the bullets had come from. I remember feeling a tingle in my spine, but I was too drugged to really feel the pain, even though my leg had begun to swell. The sergeant doctor in my squad dragged me into one of the houses and tried to remove the bullet. Each time he raised his hands from my wound, I saw my blood all over his fingers. My eyes began to grow heavy, and I fainted.  I do not know what happened, but when I woke the next day, I felt as if I had nails hammered into the bones of my shin and my veins were being chiseled. I felt so much pain that I was unable to cry out loud; tears just fell from my eyes. The ceiling of the thatched-roof house where I was lying on a bed was blurry. My eyes struggled to become familiar with my surroundings. The gunfire had ceased and the village was quiet, so I assumed that the attackers had been successfully driven away. I felt a brief relief for that, but the pain in my leg returned. I tucked my lips in, closed my heavy eyelids and held tight to the edges of the wooden bed. I heard the footsteps of people entering the house. They stood by my bed, and as soon as they began to speak, I recognized their voices.  ''The boy is suffering, and we have no medicine here to lessen his pain. Everything is at our former base.'' The sergeant doctor sighed and continued. ''It will take six days to send someone to get the medicine and return. He will die from the pain by then.''  ''We have to send him to the former base, then,'' I heard my lieutenant saying. ''We need those provisions from that base, anyway. Do all you can to make sure that the boy stays alive,'' he said and walked out. ''Yes, sir,'' the sergeant doctor said. I slowly opened my eyes, and this time I could see clearly. I looked at his sweaty face and tried to smile a little. After having heard what they said, I swore to myself that I would fight hard and do anything for my squad after my leg was healed.  ''We will get you some help,'' the sergeant doctor said gently, sitting by my bed and examining my leg. ''Just be strong, young man,''  ''Yes, sir,'' I said, and tried to raise my hand to salute him, but he tenderly brought my arm down.  Two soldiers came into the house, took me off the bed, placed me in a hammock and carried me outside. The treetops of the village began to spin around as they carried me out. The journey felt as if it took a month. I fainted and awoke many times, and each time I opened my eyes, it seemed as if the voices of those who carried me were fading into the distance.  Finally we got to the base, and the sergeant doctor, who had come along, went to work on me. I was injected with something. I was given cocaine, which I frantically demanded. The doctor started operating on me before the drugs took effect. The other soldiers held my hands and stuffed a cloth into my mouth. The doctor stuck a crooked-looking scissorslike tool inside my wound and fished for the bullet. I could feel the edge of the metal inside me. My entire body was racked with pain.  Just when I thought I had had enough, the doctor abruptly pulled the bullet out. A piercing pain rushed up my spine from my waist to the back of my neck. I fainted.  When I regained consciousness, it was the morning of the next day, and the drugs had kicked in. I reached my hands down to my leg and felt the bandage before I stood up and limped outside, where some soldiers and the sergeant were sitting. ''Where is my weapon?'' I asked them. The sergeant handed me my G3, and I began cleaning it. I shot a couple of rounds sitting against a wall, ignoring the bandage on my leg and everyone else. I smoked marijuana, ate and snorted cocaine and brown brown. That was all I did for a few days before we went back to the new base we had captured. When we left, we threw kerosene on the thatched-roof houses, lighted them with matches and fired a couple of RPGs into the walls. We always destroyed the bases we abandoned so that rebel squads wouldn't be able to use them. Two soldiers carried me in the hammock, but this time I had my gun, and I looked left and right as we traveled the forest path.  At the new base, I stayed put for three weeks. Then one day, we heard that a rebel group was on its way to attack our village. I tightened the bandage around my shin, picked up my gun and followed my squad to ambush them. We killed most of the attackers and captured a few whom we brought back to base. ''These are the men responsible for the bullet holes in your leg. It's time to make sure they never shoot at you or your comrades.'' The lieutenant pointed at the prisoners. I was not sure if one of the captives was the shooter, but any captive would do at that time. They were all lined up, six of them, with their hands tied. I shot them in their shins and watched them suffer for an entire day before finally deciding to shoot them in the head so that they would stop crying. Before I shot each man, I looked at him and saw how his eyes gave up hope and steadied before I pulled the trigger. I found their somber eyes irritating.  When I finished telling Esther the story, she had tears in her eyes, and she couldn't decide whether to rub my head, a traditional gesture indicating that things would be well, or hug me. In the end she did neither but said: ''None of what happened was your fault. You were just a little boy, and anytime you want to tell me anything, I am here to listen.'' She stared at me, trying to catch my eye so she could assure me of what she had just said. I became angry and regretted that I had told someone, a civilian, about my experience. I hated the ''It is not your fault'' line that all the staff members said every time anyone spoke about the war.  I got up, and as I started walking out of the hospital, Esther said, ''I will arrange a full checkup for you.'' She paused and then continued: ''Let me keep the Walkman. You don't want the others to envy you and steal it. I will be here every day, so you can come and listen to it anytime.'' I threw the Walkman at her and left, putting my fingers in my ears so I couldn't hear her say, ''It is not your fault.''  After that, whenever Esther would see me around, she'd smile and ask me how I was doing. At first I detested her intrusions. But slowly I came to appreciate them, even looked forward to them. It was like this at the center; most boys found a staff member whom they eventually began to trust. Mine was Esther.  Over the next few months, I started to visit Esther occasionally at the minihospital, which was just across the dirt road from the dorm that I shared with more than 35 boys. During that time, Esther got me to tell her some of my dreams. She would just listen and sit quietly with me. If she wanted to say anything, she would first ask, ''Would you like me to say something about your dream?'' Mostly I would say no and ask for the Walkman.  One day Esther gave me a Bob Marley tape and a really nice notebook and pen and suggested that I use them to write the lyrics of the songs and that we could learn them together. After that I visited Esther at the minihospital every day, to show her what I had written. I would sing her the parts of songs I had memorized. Memorizing lyrics left me little time to think about what happened in the war. As I grew comfortable with Esther, I talked to her mainly about Bob Marley's lyrics and Run-DMC's too. She mostly listened.  One night, close to my fifth month at the center, I fell asleep while reading the lyrics of a song. I startled awake after having a dream that involved lots of people stabbing and shooting one another, and I felt all their pain. The room I stood in filled with their blood. In the dream, I then went outside to sit at dinner with my father, mother and two brothers. They didn't seem to notice that I was covered with blood.  It was the first time I dreamed of my family since I started running away from the war. The next afternoon I went to see Esther, and she could tell that something was bothering me. ''Do you want to lie down?'' she asked, almost whispering.  ''I had this dream last night,'' I said looking away. ''I don't know what to make of it.''  She came and sat next to me and asked, ''Would you like to tell me about it?'' I didn't reply.  ''Or just talk about it out loud and pretend I am not here. I won't say anything. Only if you ask me.'' She sat quietly beside me. The quietness lasted for a while, and for some reason I began to tell her my dream.  At first she just listened to me, and then gradually she started asking questions to make me talk about the lives I had lived before and during the war. ''None of these things are your fault,'' she said, as she had repeated sternly at the end of every conversation. Even though I had heard that phrase from every staff member -- and had always hated it -- I began that day to believe it. That didn't make me immune to the guilt that I felt for what I had done. But it somehow lightened my burdensome memories and gave me strength to think about things. The more I spoke about my experiences to Esther, the more I began to cringe at the gruesome details, even though I didn't let her know that. I still didn't completely trust her. I only liked talking to her because I felt that she didn't judge me for what I had been a part of; she looked at me with the inviting eyes and welcoming smile that said I was still a child.  One day during my fifth month at Benin Home, I was sitting on a rock behind the classrooms when Esther came by. She sat next to me without uttering a word. She had my lyrics notebook in her hand. ''I feel as if there is nothing left for me to be alive for,'' I said slowly. ''I have no family, it is just me. No one will be able to tell stories about my childhood.'' I sniffled a bit.  Esther put her arms around me and pulled me closer to her. She shook me to get my full attention before she started. ''Think of me as your family, your sister.''  ''But I didn't have a sister,'' I replied.  ''Well, now you do,'' she said. ''You see, this is the beauty of starting a new family. You can have different kinds of family members.'' She looked at me directly, waiting for me to say something.  ''O.K., you can be my sister -- temporarily.'' I emphasized the last word.  ''That is fine with me. So will you come to see your temporary sister tomorrow, please?'' She covered her face as if she would be sad if I said no.  ''O.K., O.K., no need to be sad,'' I said, and we both laughed a bit.  Rejoining the Civilian World  Soon after, a group of visitors from the European Union, the United Nations, Unicef and several NGOs arrived at the center in a convoy of cars. At the request of the staff, we boys had prepared a talent show for them. I read a monologue from ''Julius Caesar'' and performed a short hip-hop play about the redemption of a former child soldier that I had written with Esther's encouragement. After that event, the head of the center asked me to be the spokesman for Benin Home and to speak about my experiences.  I was at the beginning of my seventh month at Benin Home when one of the field agents, Leslie, came to tell me that he was responsible for ''repatriating'' me -- the term used to describe the process of reuniting ex-child soldiers with their former communities. My family was dead, but I knew that my father had a brother whom I had never met who lived somewhere in Freetown. Leslie said he would try to find him, and if he couldn't, he'd find me a foster family to live with.  One Saturday afternoon about two weeks later, as I chatted with Esther at the minihospital, Leslie walked in, smiling widely. ''What is the good news?'' Esther asked. Leslie examined my curious face, then walked back to the door and opened it. A tall man walked in.  ''This is your uncle,'' Leslie proudly announced.  The man walked over to where I was sitting. He bent over and embraced me long and hard. My arms hung loose at my sides.  What if he is just some man pretending to be my uncle? I thought. The man let go of me. He was crying, which is when I began to believe that he was really my family, because men in Sierra Leone rarely cried.  He crouched on his heels next to me and began: ''I am sorry I never came to see you all those years. I wish I had met you before today. But we can't go back now. We just have to start from here. I am sorry for your losses.'' He looked at Leslie and continued: ''After you are done here, you can come and live with me and my family. You are my son. I don't have much, but I will give you a place to sleep, food and my love.'' He put his arms around me.  No one had called me ''son'' in a very long time. I didn't know what to say. Everyone, it seemed, was waiting for my response. I turned to my uncle, smiled at him and said: ''Thank you for coming to see me. I really appreciate that you have offered me to stay with you. But I don't even know you.'' I put my head down.  ''As I said, we cannot go back,'' he replied, rubbing my head and laughing a little. ''But we can start from here. I am your family, and that is enough for us to begin liking each other.''  I got up and hugged my uncle, and he embraced me harder than he had the first time and kissed me on my forehead. We briefly stood in silence before he began to speak again. ''I will visit you every weekend. And if it is O.K., I would like you to come home with me at some point, to see where I live and to meet my wife and children -- your family.'' My uncle's voice trembled; he was trying to hold back sobs. He rubbed my head with one hand and shook Leslie's hand with the other.  As my uncle promised, he came to visit every weekend. We would take long walks together, and they gave me a chance to get to know him. He told me about what my father was like when he was a child, and I told him about my childhood. I needed to talk about those good times before the war. But the more I heard and talked about my father, the more I missed my mother and brothers too.  About a month or so later at Benin Home, Leslie told me it was time for me to go live with my uncle. I was happy, but I was also worried about living with a family. I had been on my own for years and had taken care of myself without any guidance from anyone. If I distanced myself from the family, I was afraid that I might look ungrateful to my uncle, who didn't have to take me in; I was worried about what would happen when my nightmares took hold of me. How was I going to explain my sadness, which I was unable to hide when it took over my face, to my new family, especially the children?  I lay in my bed night after night staring at the ceiling and thinking, Why have I survived the war? Why was I the last person in my immediate family to be alive? I went to see Esther every day, though, and would say hello, ask how she was and then get lost in my own head thinking about what life was going to be like after the center. At night, I sat quietly on the veranda with my friends. I wouldn't notice when they left the bench that we all sat on.  When the day of my repatriation finally came, I walked to the minihospital building where I was to wait, my heart beating very fast. My friends Alhaji and Mambu and a boy named Mohamed were sitting on the front steps, and Esther emerged, smiling. Leslie sat in a nearby van waiting to take me to my new home.  ''I have to go,'' I said to everyone, my voice shaking. I extended my hand to Mohamed, but instead of shaking it, he leapt up and hugged me. Mambu embraced me while Mohamed was still holding me. He squeezed me hard, as if he knew it was goodbye forever. (After I left the center, Mambu's family refused to take him in, and he ended up back on the front lines.) At the end of the hug, Alhaji shook hands with me. We squeezed each other's hands and stared into each other's eyes, remembering all that we had been through. I never saw him again, since he continually moved from one foster home to another. Esther stepped forward, her eyes watery. She hugged me tighter than she ever had. I didn't return her hug very well, as I was busy trying to hold back my tears. After she let go, she gave me a piece of paper. ''This is my address,'' she said. ''Come by anytime.''  I went to Esther's home several weeks after that. But my timing wasn't good. She was on her way to work. She hugged me, and this time I squeezed back; this made her laugh after we stood apart. She looked me straight in the eyes. ''Come and see me next weekend so we can have more time to catch up, O.K.?'' she said. She was wearing her white uniform and was on her way to take on other traumatized children. It must be tough living with so many war stories. I was living with just one, mine, and it was difficult. Why does she do it? Why do they all do it? I thought as we went our separate ways. It was the last time I saw her. I loved her but never told her.

            "text": "  Instead of going to the hospital to get checked out, Bosch, along with Walling, has gone back to the Kent house, where Bosch has convinced her that the terrorist angle was meant to distract, the crime being a classic one of sex and murder: Alice Kent had conspired with Walling's partner to kill Stanley Kent. Except the partner wasn't Brenner, as Bosch had been thinking.  Harry Bosch almost laughed but was too shocked to do anything except shake his head. Rachel Walling was telling him that Cliff Maxwell, the agent Bosch had tangled with twice in the last few hours, was Alice Kent's partner in murder.  ''I can't believe this,'' he finally said. ''Three hours ago I had the killer handcuffed on the floor right here!''  Walling looked mortified by the realization that the murder of Stanley Kent was an inside job and that the theft of the cesium was nothing more than a well-played misdirection.  ''You see the rest now?'' Bosch asked. ''You see how he would work it? Her husband's dead and he starts coming around out of sympathy and because he's on the case. They start dating, fall in love and nobody ever raises an eyebrow about it. They're still out there looking for Moby and Elfayed.''  ''And what if we ever catch those guys?'' Walling said, taking up the story. ''They could deny being a part of this thing until Osama bin Laden dies in a cave of old age, but who would believe them or care? There's nothing more ingenious than framing terrorists with a crime they didn't commit.''  ''A perfect crime. The only reason it blew up was because Digiberto Gonzalves checked that Dumpster. Without him we'd still be chasing Moby and Elfayed.''  ''So what do we do now, Bosch?''  Bosch shrugged but then answered anyway.  ''I say we set up a classic rat pit. Put them both in rooms, ring the bell and say the first one who talks gets the deal. I'd bet on Alice. She'll break and give him up, probably blame him for everything.''  ''Something tells me you're right. And the truth is, I don't think Maxwell was smart enough to pull this off. I worked with --''  Walling's cellphone started buzzing. She took it out of her pocket and looked at the screen.  ''It's Jack.''  ''Find out where Maxwell is.''  She answered the call and first answered a few questions about Bosch's status, telling Brenner that he was O.K. but was losing his voice because his throat hurt. Bosch got up for another bottle of water but listened from the kitchen. Walling casually steered the call toward Maxwell.  ''Hey, where's Cliff, by the way? I wanted to talk to him about that thing with Bosch in the hallway. I didn't like what he --''  She stopped and listened to the answer and Bosch saw her eyes immediately become alert. Something was wrong.  ''When was that?'' she asked.  She listened again and stood up.  ''Listen, Jack, I've got to go. I think Bosch is about to be discharged. I'll check in as soon as I'm clear here.''  She closed the phone and looked at Bosch.  ''What?''  ''Jack said there were too many agents at the recovery scene -- just about everybody came out from downtown and they were standing around waiting on the radiation team. So Maxwell volunteered to go pick up the witness at the Mark Twain. Nobody had gotten around to it because I'd pulled off the original pickup team.''  ''He went alone?''  ''That's what Jack said.''  ''How long ago?''  ''A half-hour.''  ''He's going to kill him.''  Bosch stood up and moved toward the door.  He drove this time. On the way to Hollywood he told Walling that Jesse Mitford had no phone in his room. The Mark Twain wasn't much when it came to full service. Instead, Bosch called the watch commander at Hollywood Division and asked him to send a patrol car to the hotel to check on the witness. He then called Information and was connected to the front desk at the Mark Twain.  ''Alvin, this is Detective Bosch. From this morning?''  ''Yeah, yeah. What's up with you, Detective?''  ''Has anyone come in asking for Charles Dickens?''  ''Mmm, nope.''  ''In the last 20 minutes have you buzzed in anybody who looked like a cop or who wasn't a tenant there?''  ''No, Detective. What's going on?''  ''Listen, I need you to go up to that room and tell Charles Dickens to get out of there and to then call me on my cell.''  ''I got nobody to watch the desk, Detective.''  ''It's an emergency, Alvin. I need to get him out of there. It will take you less than five minutes. Here, write this down. My number is 323-244-5631. You got it?''  ''I got it.''  ''O.K., go. And if anybody but me comes in there looking for him, say he checked out, took a refund and left. Go, Alvin, and thanks.''  Bosch closed the phone and looked over at Rachel. His face showed his lack of confidence in the deskman.  ''I think the guy's a meth-head.''  Bosch increased his speed and tried to concentrate on driving. They had just turned south on Cahuenga off Barham. Depending on traffic in Hollywood, he was thinking that they could get to the Mark Twain in another five minutes. This conclusion made him shake his head. With a half-hour lead, Maxwell should have reached the Mark Twain by now. He wondered if he had slipped in the back way and already gotten to Mitford.  ''Maxwell may have gone in through the back,'' he told Walling. ''I'm going to come in from the alley.''  ''You know,'' Walling said, ''maybe he's not going to hurt him. He'll pick him up and talk to him, judge for himself if he saw enough at the overlook that he'd be a threat.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''No way. Maxwell's got to know that once the cesium was found in the Dumpster that his plan was going down the toilet. He's got to take action against all threats. First the witness, then Alice Kent.''  ''Alice Kent? You think he'd make a move against her? This whole thing is because of her.''  ''Doesn't matter. Survival instincts take over now, and she's a threat. It goes with the territory. You cross the big line to be with her. You cross it again to save your --''  Bosch stopped as a sudden realization thudded in his chest. He cursed out loud and pinned the accelerator as they came out of the Cahuenga Pass. He cut across three lanes of Highland Avenue in front of the Hollywood Bowl and made a screeching U-turn in front of oncoming traffic. He punched it, and the car fishtailed wildly as he headed toward the southbound entrance to the Hollywood Freeway. Rachel grabbed the dashboard and a door handle to hold on.  ''Harry, what are you doing? This is the wrong way!''  He flicked on the siren and the blue lights that flashed in the front grill and back window of the car. He yelled his response to Walling.  ''Mitford is a misdirection. This is the right way. Who is the greater threat to Maxwell?''  ''Alice?''  ''You bet, and now's the best shot he has of getting her out of Tactical. Everybody's up in that alley with the cesium.''  The freeway was moving pretty well, and the siren helped open it up further. Depending on what kind of traffic Maxwell encountered, Bosch figured he could have already gotten to downtown.  Walling opened her phone and started calling numbers. She tried number after number, but no one was answering.  ''I can't get anybody,'' she said.  ''Where's T.I.U.?''  She didn't hesitate.  ''On Broadway. You know where the Million Dollar Theater is? Same building. Entrance on Third.''  Bosch opened his phone once more and called his partner. Ferras answered right away.  ''Ignacio, drop what you're doing and meet me at the Third Street entrance to the Million Dollar Theater building. You know where that is?''  ''What's going on? I hear the siren.''  ''Do you know where the Million Dollar Theater is?''  ''Yeah, I know where it is.''  ''Meet me there at the Third Street entrance. I'll explain when I get there.''  He closed the phone.  The next 10 minutes took 10 hours. Bosch moved in and out of traffic and finally reached the Broadway exit in downtown. He killed the siren as he made the turn and headed down the hill toward their destination. They were three blocks away.  The Million Dollar Theater was built in a time when the movie business showed itself off in magnificent theater palaces that lined Broadway in downtown. But it had been decades since a first-run film was projected on a screen there. Its ornate facade had been covered by a lighted marquee that for a time announced religious revivals instead of movies. Now it waited, unused, for renovation and redemption, while above it a once-grand office building was 12 stories of midgrade office space and residential lofts.  ''Good place for a secret unit to have a secret office,'' Bosch said as the building came into sight. ''Nobody would've guessed.''  Walling didn't respond. She was trying to make another call. She then slapped the phone closed in frustration.  ''I can't even get our secretary. She always takes early lunch so there will be somebody in the office when the agents take lunch.''  ''Where exactly is the squad and where would Alice Kent be in there?''  ''We have the whole seventh floor. There's a lounge with a couch and a TV. They probably put her in there.''  ''How many in the squad?''  ''Eight agents, an A-SAC, the secretary and an office manager. The office manager just went out on maternity leave, and the secretary must be at lunch. I hope. But they wouldn't have left Alice Kent alone. It's against policy. Somebody had to have stayed there with her.''  Bosch turned right on Third and immediately pulled to the curb. Ferras was already there, leaning casually against his Volvo station wagon. In front of it was another parked car. A federal cruiser. Bosch and Walling got out. Bosch approached Ferras, and Walling went to look into the fed car.  ''Have you seen Maxwell?'' Bosch asked.  ''Who?''  ''Agent Maxwell. The guy we put on the floor at the Kent house this morning.''  ''No, I haven't seen anybody. What --''  ''It's his car,'' Walling said as she joined them.  ''Ignacio, this is Agent Walling.''  ''Call me Iggy.''  ''Rachel.''  They shook hands.  ''O.K., then he's gotta be up there,'' Bosch said. ''How many stairwells?''  ''Three,'' Walling said. ''But he'll use the one that comes out by his car.''  She pointed to double steel doors with an exit sign above them. Bosch headed over that way to see if they were locked. Ferras and Walling followed.  ''What is going on?'' Ferras asked.  ''Maxwell is our shooter,'' Bosch said. ''He is up --''  ''What?''  Bosch checked the exit doors. There was no outside handle or knob. He turned to Ferras.  ''Look, there's not a lot of time. Trust me, Maxwell is our guy, and he's in this building to take out Alice Kent. We're --''  ''What is she doing here?''  ''The F.B.I. has a location here. She's here. No more questions, O.K.? Just listen. Agent Walling and I are going up the elevator. I want you out here by this door. If Maxwell comes out, you take him down. You understand?''  ''Got it.''  ''Good. Call for backup. We're going up.''  Bosch reached over and tapped Ferras on the cheek.  ''And stay frosty.''  They left Ferras there and headed through the entrance door. There was no lobby to speak of, just an elevator. It opened at the push of the button, and Walling used a key card to engage the ''7'' button. They started going up.  ''Something tells me you're never going to call him Iggy,'' Walling said.  Bosch ignored the comment but thought of something to ask.  ''Does this thing have a bell or a tone that sounds when it reaches the floor?''  ''I can't remem -- I think it does ... yes, definitely.''  ''Great. We'll be sitting ducks.''  Bosch pulled his gun out of its holster and Walling did the same. Bosch pushed Walling to one side of the elevator while he took the other. He raised his gun. The elevator finally reached seven and there was a soft bell tone from outside. The door began to slide open, exposing Bosch first.  No one was there.  Walling signaled that the offices were to the left after exiting the elevator. Bosch lowered himself into a combat crouch and stepped out, his gun up and ready.  Again, no one was there.  He started moving to his left. Rachel came out and moved with him on his right flank. They came to a loft-style office with two rows of cubicles -- the squad room -- and three private rooms that had been built free-standing in the open floor plan. There were large racks of electronic equipment between the cubicles, and every desk had two computer screens on it. It looked as if the whole place could be packed up and moved on a moment's notice.  Bosch stepped farther in, and through a window in one of the private offices he saw a man sitting in a chair, his head back and eyes open. It looked as if he were wearing a red bib. But Bosch knew it was blood. The man had been shot in the chest.  He pointed, and Walling saw the dead man. She reacted with a quick intake of breath and a low-volume sigh.  The door to the office was ajar. They moved toward it and Bosch pushed it open while Walling covered them from behind. Bosch stepped in and saw Alice Kent sitting on the floor, her back to the wall.  He crouched beside her. Her eyes were open but dead. A gun was on the floor between her feet, and the wall behind her was spattered with blood and brain matter.  Bosch turned and surveyed the room. He understood the play. It was set up so it would look as if Alice Kent had grabbed the agent's gun from his holster, shot him and then sat down on the floor and taken her own life. No note or explanation, but it was the best Maxwell could come up with in the short amount of time and opportunity he had.  Bosch turned to Walling. She had let her guard down and was just standing there looking at the dead agent.  ''Rachel --''  There were sudden shots from outside the room and the window shattered, spraying glass across the room. Maxwell had sprung from behind one of the electronics racks. Bosch rolled to his right and came up firing, putting six shots in a spread through the window into the squad room. He caught a glimpse of Maxwell at the last moment as he jumped from cover and hit a door with an exit sign hanging from the ceiling over it.  ''Rachel?''  ''I'm fine. Go!''  ''Which exit is that door?''  He pointed at the black door Maxwell had gone through. Walling stood up and looked. Bosch saw glass all over her clothes and that she had been cut on the cheek.  ''Those stairs go down to his car.''  Bosch ran from the room toward the exit door. He opened his phone as he went and pushed the speed dial for his partner. The call was answered on half a ring. Bosch had already hit the door and was in the stairwell.  ''He's coming down!''  Bosch dropped the phone and started down the stairs. He could hear Maxwell running on the steel steps below and instinctively knew that he was too far ahead.  Bosch covered three more landings, taking three steps at a time. He could hear Walling coming down behind him. He then heard the booming sound from below as Maxwell hit the exit door at the bottom. There were immediate shouts, and then there were shots. They came so close together that it was impossible to determine how many had been fired.  Ten seconds later Bosch hit the exit door. He ran out onto the sidewalk and saw Ferras leaning against the back bumper of Maxwell's fed car. He was holding his weapon with one hand and his elbow with the other. A red rose of blood was blooming on his shoulder. Traffic had stopped in both directions on Third, and pedestrians were running down the sidewalks to safety.  ''I hit him twice,'' Ferras yelled. ''He went that way.''  He nodded in the direction of the Third Street tunnel under Bunker Hill. Bosch stepped closer to his partner and saw the wound in the ball of his shoulder. It didn't look too bad.  ''Did you call for backup?'' Bosch asked.  ''On the way.''  Ferras grimaced as he adjusted his hold on his injured arm.  ''You did real good, Iggy. Hang in there while I go get this guy.''  Ferras nodded. Bosch turned and saw Walling come through the door, a smear of blood on her face.  ''This way,'' he said.  They started down Third in a spread formation. After a few steps Bosch picked up the trail. Maxwell was obviously hurt bad and was losing a lot of blood. It would make him easy to track.  But in another 20 feet it didn't matter. Maxwell stopped them with his voice. He called out from an alleyway running perpendicular to Third.  ''I just want to say ... that it was her. She wanted him dead. I just ... I just wanted her. That's all. But she wouldn't have it any other way ... and I did what she wanted. For that ... I am damned. ...''  Bosch quietly approached the corner on a wide turn. He had his gun up and ready. Then Maxwell spoke again.  ''I'm sorry,'' he said.  Then there was another shot. Bosch made the turn and saw Maxwell on the ground leaning against the wall, his gun on the pavement between his outstretched legs. In his suicide he adopted the same position as his lover, the woman he had just killed.  Walling stood next to Bosch and looked down at the dead agent. She said nothing. Bosch checked his watch. It was almost noon. He had ridden the case from beginning to end in 12 hours. The tally was four dead, one wounded and one dying of radiation exposure.  And then there was Bosch. He wondered if he was going to be part of the tally by the time all was said and done. His throat was now blazing, and there was a heaviness in his chest.  He looked over at Walling and saw blood running down her cheek again. She would need stitches to close the wound.  ''You know what?'' he said. ''I'll take you to the hospital if you take me.''  She looked at him and smiled sort of sadly.  ''Throw in Iggy and you've got yourself a deal.''  Bosch left her there with Maxwell and walked out of the alley and back toward his partner. Backup units had just turned off Broadway onto Third. There were sirens blaring and crowds forming. Bosch decided he would leave it to the patrol officers to take charge of the crime scene. He leaned against the fender next to Ferras and told him that Maxwell had just killed himself.  ''Hell of a way to go, I guess,'' Ferras said.  Bosch nodded but kept silent. His thoughts moved down the streets and up the hills to the overlook, where the last thing Stanley Kent ever saw was the city spread before him in beautiful shimmering light. Bosch thought that maybe it wasn't so bad, for a last view. Maybe to Stanley it even looked like heaven.  Next week: The debut of ''Gentlemen of the Road,'' by Michael Chabon.

            "text": "  Written by Pedro Almod\u00f3var  In the bathroom, Raimunda (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) is getting ready for a party at her restaurant. She is half made up. The effect is as if the part of her face that isn't made up has been erased. She is speaking in a loud voice so that her daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo), can hear her in the bedroom.  RAIMUNDA -- Paula! Get ready, people will start arriving in half an hour.  In her room, Paula, serious and indolent, is lying on her bed, still wearing a track suit. She is reading a book by Paul Auster and doesn't deign to answer her mother. As she doesn't get an answer, Raimunda goes into Paula's room.  RAIMUNDA -- (fondly) Are you still like that?  PAULA -- I'm not in the mood for a party.  RAIMUNDA -- Neither am I, but it's work. Come on, don't be such a lazybones. I'll help you. What's wrong?  Raimunda sits on the bed with her daughter.  PAULA -- (serious) I can't get him out of my head when he's so close, there, in the storeroom.  Raimunda's forced optimism fades.  RAIMUNDA -- That's the best way to drive yourself crazy and to drive me crazy, too!  PAULA -- Mom, you don't know what it's like to have killed your father!  Raimunda looks at her and from her expression seems to be saying: ''There are some fathers who deserve it'' or ''You were just defending yourself.'' However, she says:  RAIMUNDA -- Paco wasn't your father.  PAULA -- Mom, don't lie to me anymore. I know you're doing it for me, but please, don't lie.  Raimunda's recently painted eyes fill up with tears that don't quite overflow. Defeated, wearily:  RAIMUNDA -- I'm not lying. Paco recognized you as his daughter, but he knew he wasn't your biological father.  On the bedside table there is a framed photo of the three. Paula is just a baby. Paco is rocking her lovingly in his arms. Paula looks at the photo.  PAULA -- Then  he was telling the truth.  RAIMUNDA -- (without any viciousness, but firmly) Yes, but that doesn't justify what he did.  Paula, curious and stunned, looks at her mother, overwhelmed by memories.  RAIMUNDA -- (pleading) I promise I'll tell you everything, another time. I swear. And now, let's get ready. There's no point in sitting here.  PAULA -- Who was my father?  RAIMUNDA -- Someone from the village.  PAULA -- Do I know him?  RAIMUNDA -- He's dead. (Pleading) Paula, I swear I'll tell you everything.  Paula looks at her and agrees.  PAULA -- (adult) I'll hold you to your word.  THE OSCARS: EXCERPTS -- VOLVER  ",

            "text": "  It was every subway rider's nightmare, times two.  Who has ridden along New York's 656 miles of subway lines and not wondered: ''What if I fell to the tracks as a train came in? What would I do?''  And who has not thought: ''What if someone else fell? Would I jump to the rescue?''  Wesley Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker and Navy veteran, faced both those questions in a flashing instant yesterday, and got his answers almost as quickly.  Mr. Autrey was waiting for the downtown local at 137th Street and Broadway in Manhattan around 12:45 p.m. He was taking his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, home before work.  Nearby, a man collapsed, his body convulsing. Mr. Autrey and two women rushed to help, he said. The man, Cameron Hollopeter, 20, managed to get up, but then stumbled to the platform edge and fell to the tracks, between the two rails.  The headlights of the No. 1 train appeared. ''I had to make a split decision,'' Mr. Autrey said.  So he made one, and leapt.  Mr. Autrey lay on Mr. Hollopeter, his heart pounding, pressing him down in a space roughly a foot deep. The train's brakes screeched, but it could not stop in time.  Five cars rolled overhead before the train stopped, the cars passing inches from his head, smudging his blue knit cap with grease. Mr. Autrey heard onlookers' screams. ''We're O.K. down here,'' he yelled, ''but I've got two daughters up there. Let them know their father's O.K.'' He heard cries of wonder, and applause.  Power was cut, and workers got them out. Mr. Hollopeter, a student at the New York Film Academy, was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He had only bumps and bruises, said his grandfather, Jeff Friedman. The police said it appeared that Mr. Hollopeter had suffered a seizure.  Mr. Autrey refused medical help, because, he said, nothing was wrong. He did visit Mr. Hollopeter in the hospital before heading to his night shift. ''I don't feel like I did something spectacular; I just saw someone who needed help,'' Mr. Autrey said. ''I did what I felt was right.''  ",

            "text": "  A DECADE ago, Maritza Simard first raised her big idea with her husband, Tom. By then they'd been married 13 years, had bought a three-bedroom, one-bath starter home here for $105,000, and felt safe that they'd reached the middle class.  Mr. Simard, a carpenter, was working steadily, building 25,000-square-foot houses for wealthy people in the Hamptons. Ms. Simard was helping with his business and selling kitchen utensils on the side. They had two children, Tom Jr., then 12, and Rachael, 8. ''Two was all we could afford when we was starting out,'' Ms. Simard says. Her husband was one of nine, and, as his wife says, ''often had to do without, and we didn't want that.''  As for Ms. Simard, her childhood was so awful, she'd never talked much about it to her husband. When she was 20 and they were courting, she says, ''he was the first man who was gentle and sweet, not wanting to attack me, not making comments about sex all the time. If he knew what I'd been through, I was afraid he'd treat me fragile.''  Her big idea: ''We was watching TV. I said, 'What do you think of taking in foster kids?' He said, 'I don't know, why would you want to?' ''  Over the next year, Ms. Simard says, she told him just enough to win him over. ''He still don't know all of it,'' she says. She told him that her mother had been a drug-addicted prostitute; that her early years in Brooklyn had been spent in boarded-up buildings, on the run from child welfare workers; that she had been sexually abused by a family member and at an early foster care placement; that she hadn't even known who she was until she was 12.  ''I thought I was Maritza Ruiz,'' she says. ''I thought my father was getting out of rehab and coming to take me and my brother out of foster care. I said, 'You come for me too?' He said, 'You're not my daughter.' '' Turned out her ''brother'' was a half-brother, her name Velez. ''Oh yeah, you get all these blows, but like a boxer you get back up.''  What saved her, she told her husband, was a foster mother, Margaret Stadier, who took her in from age 11 until she married. ''Treated me like I was hers. My husband didn't know a foster child's point of view. Now that he heard it, he says, 'O.K.' ''  For his part, Mr. Simard says he didn't make too much of his wife's stories. ''I just let it go as what happened before. I was just, 'O.K., let's try it, see what happens.' We just floated into it.''  Ms. Simard called the same agency that she says saved her, Little Flower Children and Family Services of New York. While Madonna and Angelina travel the planet to adopt, there's a plentiful supply right here. Federal officials report that each year 300,000 children need foster care; 118,000 are ready for adoption; and 19,000 age out, unadopted.  Over the next few years, a dozen foster children came and went, some staying a day, some two years, some easy, some badly damaged: a 5-year-old who couldn't chew; a 7-year-old who made animal noises; a 10-year-old who wet the bed; an 11-year-old who didn't talk.  Mr. Simard was surprised. ''I didn't know they'd be so bad off,'' he says.  Ms. Simard wasn't. ''It was one of them things I didn't say much about,'' she says.  In August 2000, they got a request to take a 3-month-old boy with bruises on the face and shoulders. ''I never refused a child,'' Ms. Simard says. ''What if somebody didn't take me in?''  By then, Mr. Simard had acclimated. Once he held the baby, Mr. Simard says, ''that little guy wasn't going nowhere.''  ''Jordan,'' says Ms. Simard. He's now 6 and adopted by the Simards. A year later, a 1-week-old arrived. He'd been abandoned at the hospital, says Ms. Simard.  ''Vincent,'' says Mr. Simard. ''Jabber Jaws.'' Mr. Simard wakes for work at 4:30 a.m. -- it's a 90-minute drive to the Hamptons job site -- and Vincent, now 5, gets up in the morning darkness to talk with Daddy.  ''He likes a bowl of Waffle Crisps,'' says Mr. Simard.  In 2002, the Simards took in two more, whom they also adopted, Steven, now 16, and his sister, Ashley, 11. Shortly after Steven arrived, Ms. Simard got a peek at his past. She and her husband were arguing. Later, she said, ''Steven asks me, 'How come you don't hit each other when you argue?' ''  By now, the Simards' two biological children take this life in stride. ''Once they get here, it doesn't feel like a change, just more people,'' says Tom Jr., 22, who lives at home and works with his dad.  ''It's a good thing Steven and Ashley stayed, because I was used to them,'' says Rachael.  The Simards are not the kind who get noticed at school. Rachael, a junior, does not participate in sports or activities. ''I just go to classes and come home,'' she says. But they're a purposeful bunch. She works as a waitress at a catering hall several nights a week, and wants to go to Suffolk Community College to become a veterinary technician. Steven plans to take vocational courses to become an electrician and work with his father. Tom Jr. has a rap group, Akademy, that plays on weekends.  Ms. Simard works three shifts a week as a clinician's assistant at Stony Brook University Medical Center ''to get us health benefits'' and will soon take the test for her real estate license.  The older children helped Mr. Simard add two bedrooms and a bathroom to their house. After dinner, the Simards play board games -- Yahtzee, Scrabble, Cranium, Pictionary.  Vincent, the youngest, probably summed it up best when asked what he likes most about his parents. ''I love my Mommy and I love my Daddy,'' he says. He knows no other.  This is not to say it's easy. Jordan's a loud, aggressive child, and Ms. Simard says even she has trouble handling him. He's been diagnosed with attention deficit and oppositional defiance disorders. They tried to mainstream Jordan, but because of his behavior, he was sent to a special education program. Or as Jabber Jaws put it, ''Jordan was on a big bus, but he spit on it, so they put him on a little bus, littler than mine, and I'm in kindergarten!''  Asked about this, Mr. Simard says, ''To me, Jordan's a normal boy.''  Ms. Simard says she doesn't know if her husband's in denial or putting a positive spin on things for a reporter, but either way, she loves him for it.  PARENTING E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com  ",

            "text": "  THE snowy night I met Willem at a synagogue in New York City, I knew we would marry, but I did not know that it would last only 10 years. He was sitting in front of me and I fell in love with the back of his neck. The floor sloped down to the front, so I didn't realize that he was 6-foot-3, more than a foot taller than I was.  He was from the Netherlands, the son of a Mennonite minister, and was drawn to Judaism. I was the child of suburban assimilated Jews. He was almost 40 and had never wed, and I was 37 and had just about given up on men, Jewish or otherwise.  Soon after, he dragged me to the Lower East Side where we met an old rabbi, who looked at us a bit askance and said wisely, ''You will have a sweet and crazy life together,'' which we did.  Nine years later, in April, our little family -- Willem; Jake, our 3-year-old son, whom we had adopted from Lithuania as a baby, and I -- visited a friend's sheep farm in Connecticut. When we returned to New York, Willem parked the car on the street near our apartment. We walked from the car with Jake riding on Willem's shoulders.  In the middle of the block I said, ''Should we get the car seat?''  Willem said, ''What's a car seat?'' And with that seemingly simple question, we entered a new kingdom.  Over the next three days, Willem's personality began to change. He had always had a bit of a temper, but one morning he asked if I had an ''ink pen.'' He sometimes used different forms of English words, but when I handed him a ballpoint, because we didn't own ink pens anymore, he began to scream at me.  He agreed to go to a marriage counselor, who advised Willem to have a checkup. I sat with a furrowed brow in the examining room as the doctor took all his vital signs. My husband was a marathon runner, in top condition, with healthy lungs and a healthy heart, but then the internist began to ask him questions.  The doctor held up a paper clip and Willem said, ''I know what it does, but I don't know the word for it.''  English was not Willem's first language, but this was something else.  ''I'm concerned,'' the doctor said. ''I'm scheduling a brain M.R.I. Immediately.''  I dropped Willem at his appointment five blocks away and went to pick up Jake at preschool.  Before Willem got home, the phone rang. It was our doctor, who said softly: ''I am sorry but I have very bad news. Your husband has glioblastoma, which is the worst form of brain cancer.''  Jake had opened the refrigerator and was pouring orange juice on the floor.  ''Do you want me to tell him?'' the doctor asked.  Jake was tugging on my sleeve to show me his handiwork.  ''No, no, thank you,'' I murmured. ''I'll tell him. Tell me one thing: Is he going to die?''  ''Yes,'' he said.  In the middle of the night, while Willem and Jake slept, I got up and Googled ''glioblastoma.'' I read, ''The patient will slowly lose all memory, as well as all bodily movement.''  The next day I found Willem reading on the couch in the living room. He was re-reading a novel in Dutch, by the author J. Bernlef, called ''Out of Mind.'' It is about a husband who slowly loses his mind and ability to speak.  I huddled next to him. ''Why are you reading this now?''  He shrugged. ''Maybe it will help me. I'm having trouble with words.''  ''Yes,'' I said and took a deep breath. ''Do you want to know about the M.R.I.?''  ''What's that?'' he said.  ''The picture, the picture they took of your brain.''  ''Yes, thank you,'' he said. He had always been a formal man, but already his speech was different.  And then, as simply as I would say we needed a new rug, I said, ''You have a brain tumor.''  He nodded, and then went back to his book.  A half-hour later, Willem called to me, while I was in the kitchen trying to feed Jake pasta wagon wheels without weeping.  ''What's it called, the tumor?''  I called back as cheerily as I could, ''Glioblastoma,'' trying to make it sound like a lovely flower.  Willem's first operation lasted four hours. After the surgeon came out, I stood before him, waiting to hear our destiny. ''We got most of it out,'' he said.  I hugged myself. ''When is he going to die?''  ''One year, maybe two. Very few people ask that question.''  I don't know why I was so blunt. Of course there are miracles. Of course there are exceptions. But I wanted to know the worst-case scenario. For me that made me feel more in control, even though I was acutely aware I was in control of nothing.  ''Live in the moment.''  ''All you have is the day.''  ''We're all terminal.''  These phrases ricocheted through my head. Some friends immediately looked up Willem's illness and forwarded their dire discoveries to me. Others told me it must be because he used a cellphone, although he did not own one. ''Blueberries,'' wrote a friend on a postcard from California. ''The antioxidants will do it. Blueberries are the key.''  WILLEM was a historian. He worked as the director of a photo archive and spent so long on his doctoral dissertation that I called him Dr. Footnote. And though he was a researcher, he never once looked up his disease and had no desire to join any kind of support group. He wanted to return to his job and work with his beloved photographs and papers, he wanted to write a book about displaced persons in World War II, he wanted to go to Prague for his 50th birthday, he wanted to take Jake and me bike riding in Belgium and run a marathon some day in Tokyo.  ''I have no interest in cancer,'' he declared, ''even if it has an interest in me.''  Yet he knew what the outcome of his illness would be. It was his idea to call the cemetery where my grandparents are buried.  A woman quoted prices over the phone. ''Do you want a single, double or triple site?''  When Willem was back on his feet, with a Nike headband on his head covering his scar, and Jake was at preschool, we drove out of the city to the bucolic cemetery on a hillside.  I was nervous having Willem drive. I always was nervous with him at the wheel. He had learned in this country, as an adult, because growing up in the Netherlands his mode of transportation was his bicycle. Now he loved ''to put the pedal to the metal'' and scream Dutch words of joy as he accelerated.  We arrived safely at the cemetery, and a gentle man carrying a transistor radio to his ear, listening to a Mets-Cardinals game, showed us around. Then we took the proper papers to fill out and my head spun wondering when my time would be. Afterward we went out for cheeseburgers and milkshakes, and drove back to the city, went home and made love.  A week before his fourth birthday, Jake announced that he wanted a cake in the shape of a fire truck. I am not a baker. I have the urge to bake perhaps twice a year, and that usually results in an apple or pumpkin pie with, I confess, store-bought crust.  But my son wanted a cake in the shape of a fire truck, and in that way that mothers are able to lift cars off their children's feet in an emergency, I somehow made one. I used practically a whole bottle of red dye in the frosting, which in earlier days would appall me. But now I reasoned that if Willem grew up on the purest whole-wheat bread and beet salad, perhaps junk food was the key to a long life.  I decorated the cake with care -- licorice hoses, peppermint wheels, butterscotch headlights and a lattice of thin pretzels for ladders. It was my offering to my son on what I knew would be his last birthday with his father.  We had the party in Central Park. Friends helped push the party favors and food in carts. Willem was able to walk there slowly, but with elegance, holding my hand, wearing his navy blue Nike headband.  The children sat at a picnic table for cake. Jake blew out the candles on the fire truck cake and made a wish. During that period of our lives, he made wishes whenever candles were lighted, and on eyelashes and fluffy dandelions. ''I always make the same wish, Mom,'' he'd say, ''and you can't ever ask me what it is.''  I didn't ask. Regardless, Willem died. On the day of the funeral, I couldn't get Jake to wear what he called his ''lots of buttons shirt,'' but he did acquiesce to a navy blue polo shirt with three buttons.  AT the synagogue, when Willem's friends were eulogizing him, Jake began to lose patience and tugged on my arm.  ''I want to go to the digging part,'' he said.  Finally we drove out of the city, dazed and weary, to the cemetery on the hill where Willem and I had blithely picked out a spot and spent our romantic afternoon only months before. A sweet wind blew in the August afternoon.  We all took turns shoveling, in the way the rabbi had instructed, with the shovel upside down to show this was a special kind of digging. And then, and then, a picture I thought I would never see -- my 4-year-old son reached for the shovel and he, too, dumped two shovelfuls of dirt onto his father's plain pine coffin.  A train whistled in the valley below us, and Jake handed the shovel to his cousin and put his arms straight up in the air. I knew what he wanted. I lifted him up as the rabbi said prayers, and we watched the train snaking by. I held him tightly and we waved to the far-off travelers.

            "text": "  I think I may have accidentally ended up in a pornographic film. It all began when I took a trip to Los Angeles. I suppose you could have guessed that. The story of one's adult-film debut rarely begins, ''So I went to an Amish village in Pennsylvania. . . . ''  Now, I must confess to having a pretty na\u00efve view of the world. Whenever I go to L.A., I sort of expect to end up in a movie. I mean, that seemed to be what happened whenever Laverne and Shirley or the ''Happy Days'' gang went to L.A., and both of those programs were nothing if not realistic. I still believe that the streets of L.A. are packed with celebrities. When I pick up my rental car, I expect that Nicole Richie will run into me, or that Mel Gibson will accuse me of being Jewish.  In reality, here is the type of show-business encounter I've had in L.A.: I once met John Tesh's assistant in a bar.  I also once held a party in an L.A. hotel room that was attended by Jerry Maren, one of the munchkins from ''The Wizard of Oz.'' I'll never forget that cute little munchkin waddling up to me and barking, ''Vodka and Sprite.'' When I told him we only had 7-Up, he clenched his jaw as if I'd just crossed a Lollipop Guild picket line. He gave me the skunk eye for the rest of the night.  But let's get back to the night of my film debut. My friends and I were at dinner when one of them got a call on his cell. There was a party. A crazy party. A party way too hip for us, but there was a guy who could get us in.  Obviously, I said yes. I'm always looking for things that are too good for me. When choosing a college, I wanted a ''reach'' school. As for women, I'm not looking for a soul mate -- I want a woman who's way out of my league. A woman who'll be making the mistake of her life going out with me. At my wedding, I want to overhear people pointing to the bride and whispering, ''She could do so much better.''  Somehow, I don't think that'll be a problem.  The party was way up in the Hollywood Hills. One of the things that stand out about the evening is the long, arduous climb up the hills, which in retrospect is a little strange -- you don't normally think of ascending to Hell.  We arrived at the house to find a long line of people waiting outside a gate. My friend called his contact, who sent word to the security guard to let us in. As we passed through the gate, I noticed the security guard was making the other people sign a waiver as they entered.  A waiver?  Inside, I found a crowd of people, yet no one had a drink. The women all looked as if they could've been in a M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce video . . . 15 years ago. Make that a hard 15 years ago. As for the guys, I saw a man dressed like an oil sheik handing out business cards claiming he was Bob Guccione. So on the list of Things I Wasn't Expecting to See When I Woke Up This Morning, there was that.  To make things even more surreal, a film crew was walking around taking shots of the partygoers. Like most people, when confronted with a situation that makes me uncomfortable, I like to drink heavily. Seeing as how this was a party, that shouldn't have been a problem. But hard as I looked, I couldn't find a drop of booze.  I walked out onto the balcony, searching for a keg. Instead, I found an L.A.P.D. helicopter hovering above me. Almost immediately, I was bathed in its ominous searchlight. Oh, boy.  When I walked back inside, one of my friends excitedly told me the news. We were smack dab in the middle of an adult-film shoot! It turns out a film company had rented the house, and they had shot the good stuff during the week. They then opened the house up on the weekend to get stock party footage to put in between the sex scenes.  Now do I look familiar? That's right, many of you men reading this have probably fast-forwarded past me. And in case there was any doubt that I'm a loser, consider the fact I somehow managed to end up in a sex film without actually getting to, you know, have sex. My wife-to-be can do so much better.  Sadly, I don't know the name of the film they were shooting, so I've never seen it. Yet somewhere out there exists an adult film with me in it. I may never find it, but it ain't gonna be for a lack of looking.

            "text": "  THE father of Fidelina Claros has spent most of his days lately sitting quietly in a hard chair by a shelf of cleaning supplies and votive candles in the G & P Deli & Grocery, just a few feet from the counter where his daughter died, with two bullets to her head and one to her back.  He always has plenty of company. His grandson was at the register one recent morning, selling lottery tickets to those who felt lucky. His son and daughter-in-law were dispensing coffee and making sandwiches for the early lunch trade. And his daughter smiled at him from a picture that was taped inside the glass candy display.  ''She was alone,'' said Joe Andino, who lives a few doors up Webster Avenue in the Heights neighborhood and who has joined the brigade of family and friends that has kept the store going. ''Nobody's here alone anymore.''  Fidelina Claros was alone in her corner store just before 1 p.m. the day before Halloween -- the store she had bought five years earlier with money saved from her job as a home health aide, the store where she worked seven days a week, closing only to go to church on Sunday mornings, the store from which she dispensed motherly wisdom to grateful neighbors -- when someone came in with a semiautomatic .22 pistol, shot her and took all the money from the cash drawers of the register and the lottery machine. She had turned 47 just two days before.  ''It was a vicious killing,'' said the Hudson County prosecutor, Edward J. De Fazio. ''Brutal. We thank God we don't see too many of these stranger-on-stranger type cases.'' Investigators have a sketch of the driver of the getaway car, but as of late Wednesday they had not arrested any suspects.  For several weeks after her murder, as her family took her body home for burial in her native El Salvador, Ms. Claros's store remained closed, the metal grate drawn down tight on the narrow space that her vibrant generosity had widened into a welcoming hearth for the neighborhood. But that just didn't seem right, to let her killers claim the store as a victim, too.  ''Every single can, every piece of merchandise, is Fidelina's effort,'' said her companion, Mario Avelar, an insurance agent who first met her when she bought a policy in 1988. Like him, she was divorced, and two years ago she left her longtime home in North Bergen to live with him in Roselle. ''We shouldn't leave everything behind and just walk away.''  And so the grate went up again in late November, and family and friends tried to fill the void behind the counter. ''We started opening up at 6:45 to let them know we're down but we're not out,'' said Mr. Andino. (The store had previously opened at 7.) An auto mechanic, he starts each day buttering rolls and making coffee for the construction workers who are the first customers. ''Nobody will scare us away.''  Ms. Claros's son Brian Herrera arrives next and holds down the day shift with Concepcion and Misael Claros, his aunt and uncle. Misael then picks up Brian's sister, Johanna, a high school sophomore, who stays until the store closes at 8:30.  ''At first it was very hard,'' Johanna Herrera said. ''But this was like her home.''  Ms. Claros's oldest son, Guillermo, also works at the store in the evenings. Her father, Juan, will soon return to his home in El Salvador after a month's visit. He has a small grocery store of his own there, but it has never been robbed.  ''Somebody might take a piece of candy, that's it,'' Mr. Claros said in Spanish, as Mr. Andino translated.  The ''For Sale'' sign that Ms. Claros put up not long before her death still hangs in the window. ''She said, 'Enough is enough, I've got to get out of this,' '' said Mr. Avelar, who has talked of organizing a march to City Hall -- to remember her, and to call attention to what he believes is the need for more police presence in the area around the store. ''I always was afraid, from the very beginning of the business.''  There are still four years left on the lease, and if no buyer appears, her family plans to keep running the store as long as they can. ''I could do it,'' said Brian Herrera, 20, who goes to school at night to get his G.E.D. ''She died in this store to have money, to put a plate on the table for us. She was just trying to raise us up.''  When his mother was here, she lighted a votive candle every day, and now that the store has come back to life, somebody takes one each morning from the shelf behind Juan Claros's chair and lights it again. One was burning behind Mr. Herrera as he worked the register at the spot where his mother died.  JERSEY  ",

            "text": "  Wesley Autrey teetered back and forth on the edge of a subway platform yesterday, re-enacting how he dived onto the tracks of a southbound No. 1 train in Manhattan on Tuesday to save another man's life.  A little boy with black hair and a bowl cut followed each of his moves. Other passers-by at the 137th Street station let loose the occasional hurrah or hand clap. Still others riffled through newspapers, which featured Mr. Autrey's picture and headlines like ''Subway Superman.''  A few subway stops away, at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center on 114th street near Amsterdam Avenue, Cameron Hollopeter underwent a second day of medical evaluation. Police said Mr. Hollopeter, a first-year film student at the New York Film Academy, had suffered a seizure, which sent him convulsing off the platform and onto the tracks, where Mr. Autrey held him down as the train rumbled just inches above them.  Moments after the train came to a halt, Mr. Autrey recounted yesterday, Mr. Hollopeter asked if he was dead. ''I said, 'You are very much alive, but if you move you'll kill the both of us.' '' Both men emerged from the episode with little more than bruises, but Mr. Autrey also emerged a star.  Mr. Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker, said he knew something was different when he showed up for work later on Tuesday. His boss, he said, bought him lunch -- a ham-and-cheese hero -- and later told him to take yesterday off.  Then yesterday morning, as he walked to his mother's apartment in Harlem, ''a stranger came up and put $10 in my hand,'' he said. ''People in my neighborhood were like, 'Yo, I know this guy.' ''  Once at his mother's apartment, he held interviews in the living room with some of the national morning news programs.  After that, it was back to the scene, where he recounted Mr. Hollopeter's backward tumble off the platform and into the path of the oncoming train.  Throughout the day, Mr. Autrey's sister, Linda, 48, played the role of administrative assistant, logging invitations for the talk-show circuit, including requests from the David Letterman, Charlie Rose and Ellen DeGeneres shows. Phone calls from well-wishers came pouring in, including one from the mayor's office. Mr. Autrey said he had been offered cash, trips and scholarships for his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, who watched as he dived to the trackbed.  ''Donald Trump's got a check waiting on me,'' he said. ''They offered to mail it; I said, 'No, I'd like to meet the Donald, so I can say, Yo, you're fired.' ''  By the end of the day, the president of the New York Film Academy, Jerry Sherlock, had personally handed him a $5,000 check.  Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Autrey and Mr. Hollopeter met again. The meeting was closed to reporters, but afterward Mr. Autrey described how he stepped into Mr. Hollopeter's hospital room, where they shared a few laughs as Mr. Hollopeter's father stood by with tears in his eyes.  Shortly after 4 p.m., Mr. Autrey walked out of the hospital with Mr. Hollopeter's father, Larry, and into a throng of more than 30 reporters and camera operators who jammed microphones into their faces.  ''This is Cameron's father,'' Mr. Autrey began. ''He's a very, very, nice, nice man and, you know, I'm not used to this press,'' he said, as reporters shouted at them to lean closer to the microphones and camera shutters popped like party favors.  Mr. Hollopeter was nervous, his hands shaking, as he read from handwritten notes.  ''Mr. Autrey's instinctive and unselfish act ---- '' Mr. Hollopeter said, hesitating, as reporters inched closer. ''There are no words to properly express our gratitude and feelings for his actions. Cameron is recovering and stable. Now he needs his rest, and our wishes are that you respect his privacy. May God's blessings be with Mr. Autrey and his family.''  The teary father then slipped back into the hospital, apparently overcome with emotion.  ''Me and the families are trying to make some plans so his family can meet my family and we can have a little gathering,'' Mr. Autrey said, before breaking into a hearty laugh. ''Without the media!''  Mr. Autrey was asked to reflect on the experience.  ''Maybe I was in the right place at the right time, and good things happen for good people,'' Mr. Autrey said.  Then he hopped into his brother-in-law's tan Toyota Corolla. As the car pulled away, Mr. Autrey had some final words: ''All New Yorkers! If you see somebody in distress, go for it!''  ",

            "text": "  MY grandfather, Theodore Anton Gehrig Sr., was Lou Gehrig's first cousin.  When I was a girl, Grandpa would tell us that when he was growing up in Milwaukee, he'd go to Lou's games whenever Lou passed through town on barnstorming tours. Grandpa, who's been gone awhile, used to say that I should write Eleanor, Lou's widow. I wish I'd done it -- but I didn't want to seem as if I were being greedy or wanted something from her.  So today, we don't have anything from Lou through the family. But there's eBay. In fact, I wish I'd started with it earlier.  Before, it was hard to find Lou Gehrig stuff here in Wisconsin, although sometimes I'd find specialty shops with things like limited-edition plates or ornaments. My sister would also try to find stuff, but she's not into it as much as I am. Here at my house in Racine, we have a room downstairs with all the Lou Gehrig memorabilia I've bought off eBay. The mailman is probably getting mad at me by now.  We have about 75 items, including figurines, books, old newspaper articles and advertisements featuring Lou, items with Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth together -- all things I want to pass on to my children. My dad, who's 81, is excited about it. He didn't collect Lou Gehrig stuff when he was younger; he had a hard enough time raising eight of us kids. My family, especially my mom and my aunt, likes to see the new stuff I've gotten every time they come by. The pictures are all up on the wall, and in one of the bedrooms I have a shelf with all the books and figurines.  I get a lot of e-mail from eBay sellers who see my name and ask me if I'm related to Lou. They're surprised that I am, since Lou didn't have any brothers or sisters who made it past childhood, and also because he and Eleanor didn't have any children. Grandpa's dad was a brother of Lou's dad. It's a distant relationship, but it's there. The eBay sellers seem glad when something they sell goes to the Gehrig family.  I spend a couple of hours online every day and check my auctions about four times a day. Sometimes, when I see something with Lou's name on it, I think to myself, ''Wow, that's my name up there.''  The first item I ever purchased was a gold coin with Lou's picture on it, but one of the items I cherish most is a photo of him giving his farewell speech on Lou Gehrig Day. He's at home plate, scratching his head, and all of the old-time microphones are there. The photo isn't an original print, but it's a limited edition.  I've also got a Lou Gehrig pocketknife, a talking Christmas ornament and a picture of Lou dressed up as a cowboy in the 1938 Western ''Rawhide.'' He looks real funny dressed in leather like that.  Of the newspaper ads, one has Lou selling Williams Shaving Cream, which was supposed to ''take the starch out of whiskers.'' Another is of him selling Camel cigarettes. Then there's one for Royal Crown Cola that says the soda was Lou's secret for hitting home runs.  I've got a 1932 newspaper from when the Yankees beat the Chicago Cubs in the World Series.  I couldn't believe it when I first saw them, but now I also have three different bobbleheads. They're all in their boxes, and that's where they're going to stay. I want to get an autographed ball one day, but those are getting pretty high-priced. They go for about $10,000 each. Maybe I'll win the lottery.  My husband, Mike, is a big Cubs fan, but he's gotten me more into collecting stuff about Lou. We argue over the Cubs and the Yankees all the time. I argue for the Yankees, of course, because of the family.  We have two kids who already carry on the pride of the family name. The eBay stuff is for them to have. Our son, Felix Theodore Mireles III, is 25, married and expecting his first child. He's named after my dad and Grandpa.  My daughter, Amanda, who's 22, has been through a lot in her short life. She's had Hodgkin's lymphoma, avascular necrosis and cancer and has had chemo, radiation and a bone-marrow transplant. Through all that, she went to college and had a son, but he passed away after fighting hard for 13 days. We say that he had Lou's strength to hang on that long. Everyone called him the ''miracle boy.'' It is so amazing to me to watch my child go though all of this and be so very strong. She definitely has the Gehrig courage and talks about using the Gehrig name as a middle name if she has another child.  It may be hard to believe, but I have never been to Yankee Stadium or visited Lou's grave in Valhalla, N.Y. I absolutely hope to do it someday. I'm very proud of the family name. That's one of the reasons why I kept my maiden name. I come from a long line of courageous and humble people. That's why I admire Lou's humility. He was very humble, a great man.  I think of my father that way, and I think of my grandfather that way too. I wish I asked my grandfather more questions about him and Lou when I was growing up.  As you get older, things like that mean a lot more.  RITUALS  ",

            "text": "  I'D met the happily married man several times, always at one of the parties Doug gave in his loft in TriBeCa, but we never got to know each other very well. He was alarmingly kind, and of course married, but for some reason, his happily married wife and I didn't remember each other. Could be because Doug's loft seems to be the size of a football field, and when you are in a space the size of a football field, you usually don't get to know the people on the other side unless you have a pair of binoculars.  Doug knew that for a variety of reasons, mostly having to do with lack of funds, my living situation had once again become unmanageable. I was moving out of the room where I was living in the West Village, which I could no longer pay for -- the unromantic aspect of being a writer -- and I had no idea where I was going. So, in September, when Doug went on location to direct a hundred-million-dollar movie, he offered me the keys to his loft for a few months.  By the time he got back, the idea was, my life would be sorted out. And in fact, I didn't feel too bad about moving in. I figured that I could check his mail, water his plants and generally manage things, even though he has a staff of people taking care of him even when he's not there.  The weekend that my cat, Boo, and I were to move in, I discovered that Doug had also given loft keys to the happily married man and the happily married woman, who, as it turned out, had a happy baby. It's inappropriate to be furious with somebody who's doing you a favor. But since I work at home, I worried that I'd never be able to get any work done, not to mention that the thought of a screaming baby, happy or not, terrified me.  In the scrambling for options, seven friends offered alternatives that involved couches, beds and futons. But Doug's two-story loft, with the vast open space below and gorgeous bedrooms above, seemed to be my safest bet, as I would have my own room and the happy family would have theirs.  Still, the first weekend was overwhelming. Forbes magazine had already listed TriBeCa as the 12th most expensive neighborhood in the country, which, as a friend pointed out, meant that TriBeCa had become the most expensive square mile in the city. Boutiques, designer shops and strollers were everywhere.  Yet more noticeable than the outside, I could see inside that the happily married man and the happily married woman were excessively kind to each other. Everyone in the happy family, which now included me, was treated with total respect and fairness, something I don't see a lot of. Even more unnerving was to discover they were equally kind to each other even when they thought I wasn't there.  The happy baby was 15 months old at the point we all moved in together, an enchanting and joyful child except when she screamed. The first time I heard her cry, the crying lasted 45 minutes. It didn't really last that long, but it seemed to. I was afraid that something might be wrong with her, but the next morning the happily married woman explained what was going on. ''You're not supposed to pick them up for the first 10 minutes,'' she explained. ''It's not good for them.''  Friends explained to me that this kind of child rearing is called the Ferber method, which thankfully didn't exist when I was growing up. The approach struck me as a bit harsh, both for the child and for me, but I accepted this as my fate. I knew what I was getting into.  After a while, you get used to the sound of a baby wailing, especially if you don't have to do anything about it. You go back to sleep, or you leave the house. Or you lie on your bed and simply absorb the sound. There were times I connected with her pain. Other times I felt a tinge of jealousy that she was allowed to express her emotions so openly while we adults are encouraged to suppress ours altogether.  No matter, the loft was filled with a peacefulness. I considered inviting friends over just so they could see the couple in action: opening the refrigerator with love, taking out the trash with love; good mornings and good nights with love. But I didn't want to exploit their happiness.  One afternoon, I noticed that the happily married woman's expression was not as vibrant as usual. When I asked her why she was down, she told me that the happily married man had found them a great apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, but when she had gone to look at the place, the landlord wouldn't let her in. I couldn't imagine why until she went on to explain, ''Because of the color of my skin.''  ''In Brooklyn?'' I demanded.  ''Yes, in Brooklyn,'' she replied.  What I haven't mentioned is that the happily married man is an attractive white male and the happily married woman is a stunning black female. She told me that this sort of thing happens about once a month. I was devastated for them.  Every once in a while, I gave Doug updates about how things are going in the loft, usually when he dropped by between trips from Toronto, Paris or Rome. On the last visit, I urged him to observe the happy couple closely. I told him that maybe we could learn from them, because one thing Doug and I have in common is that we believe in true love without actually having ever committed to it. Or at least our commitments thus far have been sporadic. We also discussed the Ferber method and concluded that maybe our problem is that we were picked up too much when we were babies.  Not too long ago, the happily married man and the happily married woman pulled me aside and told me that they had just had a fight. I replied that I didn't believe them because they were smiling. ''It's true,'' one of them insisted. ''We were in a fight, and in fact, we're still having it.'' As they continued to tell me about their minor skirmish, I knew they were just trying to make me feel better about my life, which of course didn't work.  The fear of moving in with the happy family turned out to be more frightening than the reality. They didn't stand in the way of getting my work done, and I didn't lose that much sleep. And if it weren't for the happy baby, I wouldn't know, for example, that there are 15 1/2 steps between the floors of Doug's loft.  One recent weekend, I packed my bags and left. Another friend who watches over me had helped me find a place to live above an Italian restaurant in the Village. Even though the landlord warned me about the ghost who lives in the building, I moved in anyway. I've never been afraid of ghosts, and after staying in Doug's loft, I'm not afraid of happiness anymore.

            "text": "  DEAR DIARY:  I was walking on West 72nd Street last month when I was approached by a tourist who spoke very little English. She asked, ''Where doctor's apartment?''  I asked her to repeat her question, and she said, ''Where doctor's apartment?'' I started to be concerned because she was clearly looking for a doctor and I could not help her. I asked her, ''Which doctor?'' She replied, ''John Lennon.''  My linguistic skills kicked in and I knew she wanted the Dakota Apartments. I pointed her in the right direction and she marched away happily, camera in hand.  Trudy Zimmern  Dear Diary:  Overheard in a diner on Second Avenue, on New Year's Day:  An elderly man is having lunch when a friend, also quite elderly, arrives, takes off his coat, sits down and asks, ''So, how are you doing?'' The friend replies, ''I don't know -- how do I look?''  Marian Miller  Dear Diary:  On a recent Saturday, I was in Prospect Park, skating with my mother and younger sister. After going several rounds, I decided to rest awhile on the grass near the parking lot and wait for my mother and sister to catch up. As I sat idly, I took to carefully surveying the people speeding down the track ahead of me.  I observed the following: a cloud of up-and-coming Tour de France champions whizzing past one very irate elderly man passionately scolding them in fluent Cantonese; a pregnant woman power-walking her triple stroller down the runners' track; a youngish man swiveling expertly down the riders' path on his rather innovative two-prong, four-wheel scooter-cycle (patent surely pending); and a man on a bicycle, pulling a child on a tricycle, clutching a dachshund puppy strapped to a basket at the handlebars.  Latoya Raveneau  Dear Diary:  Commuting from my apartment in Washington Heights to my teaching job at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais, I often chose the leisurely No. 4 bus, which provided door-to-door service, though at a slower pace than the subway.  Another advantage was the occasional urban adventure, including a memorable moment when the driver came to a sudden stop at Columbus Avenue and 110th Street and darted out of the bus to help a very nontraditional commuter.  I was sitting in the front seat, and the driver handed me the new passenger for safekeeping: a small, stunned bird that had apparently just flown into the windshield of the bus, and was groggy but otherwise unharmed.  By the time we reached Fifth Avenue, my seatmate had started to recover; no longer in need of a special unscheduled stop, it waited patiently in my hands until the bus arrived at 96th and Fifth, and then exited, cheerfully fluttering just above the other passengers out the door. I couldn't help hoping that this was its intended destination all along.  Jane F. Ross  Dear Diary:  Date: Just before Christmas. Scene:  The lobby of a Central Park West building. Two brothers, ages 5 and 8, are waiting for the elevator while admiring the newly decorated Christmas tree.  Boy, 5: ''I like to take the candy canes off the tree and eat them.''  Boy, 8: ''I used to like candy canes but now I don't like them so much anymore.''  Boy, 5: ''That's because your taste buds are changing.''  Boy, 8: ''Yeah. You know how I knew my taste buds were changing?''  Boy, 5: ''No.''  Boy, 8: ''When I started to like the inside of sushi.''  Rachel Melniker  Dear Diary:  The Scene: The Union Square Greenmarket on a Saturday in early January when the temperatures reached the low 70s.  Overheard: A young woman, dressed appropriately for a day at the beach, is chatting on her cellphone: ''I mean, like, what's the point of global warming if you can't wear flip-flops?''  Brenda Fine  Dear Diary:  A couple of weeks ago, my husband, Steven, was on a Lexington Avenue bus when he heard the following announcement: ''No smoking or drinking on the bus.''  At this point, a little boy, approximately 5 years old, got up from his seat and started to walk around the bus, much to the consternation of his baby sitter.  When he reached my husband, he pointed his little finger and said, ''No smoking or drinking on the bus.''  My husband asked good-naturedly, ''Why are you telling me this?'' The child replied, ''You look like you would smoke and drink!'' whereupon the bus exploded in peals of laughter.  When my husband got off the bus there was a chorus of passengers yelling, ''No smoking or drinking on the bus.''  Carol Rand  Metropolitan Diary  ",

            "text": "  Fermina Nunez's life, dreams and death all revolved around her love of hair. Even as a young girl in the Dominican Republic, she worked as a stylist at her aunt's salon, her family said. Without any formal training, they said, she intuitively did a delicate, elaborate dance with scissors, combs and blow dryers.  Styling led her to opportunities in the Bronx; Providence, R.I.; and Middletown, N.Y. The last place was where she finally opened up her own salon, Final Cuts by Fermina, and she hoped she would be able to buy her first house for her and her four sons.  Her love for her job was such, her family said, that she often stayed at her salon well past its official closing time. That happened on Saturday night, the police said, when she stayed past the normal 10 p.m. closing to help three clients primp for New Year's Eve.  About 11:55, a man walked into the salon, at 133 Wickham Avenue in Middletown, and told Ms. Nunez and her three customers to lie face down on the floor, said Gregory Metakes, a spokesman for the Middletown Police Department. The man asked Ms. Nunez how to open the cash register. When he couldn't, he became angry, walked over to her with a small-caliber handgun, and shot her once in the back of the head, according to witness accounts given to the police.  The man, said to be about 5 feet 6 inches tall, more than 200 pounds, and wearing a black hood and a Yankees cap, fled, but it was unclear if he left on foot or in a vehicle, the police said.  Late last night, officers from Middletown and the state police took a man in the Bronx River section of the Bronx into custody in connection with the killing, and moved him to Middletown for questioning. Domonic Simone, 49, who lives on the street where the man was taken into custody, said that about 9 p.m., ''I heard two shots and at first I thought they were fireworks because last night there were fireworks.''  Ms. Nunez's death, in addition to devastating her four sons -- Anthony, 18; Michael, 16; Chris, 15; and Brian, 13 -- five brothers and sisters, and 21 nieces and nephews, has also stunned her loyal customers, many of whom showed up last night bearing cards, flowers and votive candles that they placed outside her salon.  Charnell Tootle, 29, said she liked to get her hair done by Ms. Nunez since she was the only one in town who could do a doobie the way she liked it -- a style in which the hair is set in rollers and then blown out to cover the face.  ''Fermina was the only one who knew this particular hairstyle,'' said Ms. Tootle, who dropped off a heart-shaped balloon last night. She said she had started taking her two young daughters to the salon.  ''Her shop felt comfortable and homey,'' Ms. Tootle said.  Ms. Nunez, who was 36, loved Middletown and lobbied her siblings to move there. It was quieter and safer than in the Bronx, she argued.  Two of her siblings had moved there and a third planned to do so this year.  ''She wanted to get us away from the crime, and the crime came to us,'' said Juan Nunez, 37, one of her brothers who lives in Middletown. The family said last night that they would keep the salon open. They say they know she would have wanted it that way.  ",

            "text": "  For a family that has every reason not to be receptive to strangers, the Ownbys' home exudes hospitality, nestled among trees on an unpaved road near this town southwest of St. Louis.  In the front yard, there is a sign. It does not say ''Keep out'' or ''No trespassing.'' Instead, it says ''Welcome to our pad'' and is illustrated by the cartoonlike image of a happy frog.  Inside, William Ownby, 13, known as Ben, is showering, an everyday sort of activity that under the present circumstances almost rises to the level of something to be celebrated around here. It was just over a week ago that Ben disappeared, abducted by a stranger just moments after stepping off a school bus about 500 feet from his front door on a typical Monday afternoon.  Four days later, the police found not only Ben but also another Missouri teenager, Shawn Hornbeck, 15, who had been missing for four years, in an apartment in a St. Louis suburb, Kirkwood. Michael Devlin, 41, has been in custody since then, charged with Ben's kidnapping and awaiting arraignment.  To say the boys' lives have been changed forever is an understatement. But their families want nothing more than a return to normal, however hard that is when network news producers are calling and representatives of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' are waiting outside.  On the porch, Ben's father, William Ownby, known as Don, is reflecting on the last few days. ''Now it's the beginning of all new things,'' he said Tuesday. ''We're very happy, just thrilled that this had a happy ending. It's all so overwhelming.''  Between seeking counseling for the family and accommodating the news media, Mr. Ownby, who handles inventory for a local company, said his head was spinning. Above all, he said, he just wants to make the right decisions for Ben: When should he go back to school? Should he take the bus? How much should they expect him to talk about his days in captivity? Will he ever heal?  ''We're trying to get the best possible advice we can and listen to the experts,'' Mr. Ownby said. ''He was only gone four days, but they were four very long days. He's taking it as well as can be expected.''  Ben has been playing video games and cards, seeing relatives and enjoying quiet time with his sister and parents. The Ownbys said he had not talked about his abduction.  Mr. Ownby would not allow a reporter to speak with Ben and did not take him to a news conference later in the day. But Ben did tell The Associated Press that he was tired of seeing himself on television and that ''it feels like I'm getting bruises from too many hugs.''  Shawn Hornbeck's parents did not attend the news conference and did not return calls for comment.  At the news conference, Mr. Ownby and his wife, Doris, expressed their appreciation for all the support they had received since Ben disappeared. They also asked for space. They said they would not be giving any more interviews after this week.  ''We have to stop somewhere to let him settle down and let him -- '' Mrs. Ownby said, her voice trailing off. Mr. Ownby continued for her, ''be a boy, be a kid.'' She added, ''We're just extremely fortunate that Ben came back to us as fast as he did.'' And she joked that she might not let him out of her sight again. ''He's already decided what college he wants to go to, out in California,'' she said. ''I said: 'Oh, no you're not! You're not going that far.' ''  ",

            "text": "  LYNN BIEDERMAN, 44, says this about her mother: ''Had we not been mother and daughter, our paths would never cross.''  Ms. Biederman lives in a woodsy part of northern Westchester County, in a big house full of comfy, country-style furniture. Though she has a full life with her husband of 20 years and their two teenagers, and her work as a children's book writer and part-time librarian, she loves to slack off, pad around the house, eat in, sleep late. ''I would do anything to stay in bed, in a room as dark as a cave, for as long as possible,'' she says  .Her mother, Judith West Edelman, a wealthy businesswoman who refuses to give her age (''If I have to tell you, the story's off''), lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 40th-floor apartment with a spectacular view of the East River, rooms full of spare modern furniture and lots of unshaded windows that let the light pour in at dawn -- which is when she gets up seven mornings a week to work out at her gym.  The daughter, who's in fine shape (5 feet 3 inches, 112 pounds), once made the mistake of using her mother's personal trainer. ''I was like, 'Lou, why you giving me so much weight?' He says: 'What do you mean? Your mother does more reps at a higher weight and she never complains.' ''  The daughter seeks to avoid conflict. The mother relishes a fight. (She interrupted our interview to take a call about a woman she is battling in her co-op over an allegedly oversized dog.)  The daughter prefers quiet getaways and hates the Hamptons. The mother likes fancy restaurants, has a big house in the Hamptons and loves the scene.  The daughter is a Democrat, the mother a Republican.  The daughter served me home-baked vanilla cake warm from the oven and homemade cappuccino; the mother's uniformed maid served herbal tea from tea bags and low-fat cookies from the health food store.  The mother is punctual and has no time for fiddle-faddle; the daughter's constantly late because she fiddle-faddles. One of the mother's favorite sayings is, ''Fast walker, fast thinker.'' One of the daughter's is, ''What's the rush, Mom?''  The daughter believes her children are entitled to an explanation. The mother believes her own two children and her four grandchildren should not be overindulged. One of the mother's quippy sayings to silence children: ''Why? Because it's a letter in the alphabet.''  The daughter works at home. She knows her 14-year-old daughter's taste in food, clothes and books and loves shopping for her.  The mother works in an office -- once an assistant to the late Milton Petrie, the renowned women's clothing retailer, she is now president of Westco, her retail fixture business. The mother was too busy working to go with the daughter to pick out a wedding dress and sent her mother-in-law, the grandmother.  For years the mother and daughter had a guarded relationship. Many of the daughter's best friends are women who aren't close with their mothers.  The mother was too consumed by work to make women friends. ''I liked to talk business, and not many women did,'' she says. ''Even as a kid, I was a loner. I began to see myself as not friendly or having social skills. I'd say, 'So what, I make a million dollars a year.' ''  But in the last few years, things changed between mother and daughter. They grew close. There was no epiphany, they agree. The mother's quippy saying for this is: ''I suppose it's an accumulation of two-way streets.'' Each woman realized she'd fallen into the same trap.  ''I strove to be the opposite of my mother,'' the daughter says.  And the mother? ''I grew up hungry to be different from my mother.''  Seeing the problem helped break the cycle.  The mother grew up poor in Dallas. She says her father, a traveling salesman, was a ''brutal'' bully. ''I saw my mother being pushed around. I myself was. My mother, poor thing -- any friends she had were losers in life. So I had to figure out for myself what kind of woman I wanted to be. No one was going to push me around. I saw very quickly a woman couldn't have a voice without economic independence.'' Her first glimpse of what she wanted came during an after-school job at a Dallas department store. ''Those Neiman Marcus women, that was the life I wanted. It stoked the fire.''  Even though her husband, Sanford Edelman, is a successful businessman, she has never lost her fear of being dependent and has never slowed in her career. She continues to work when most her age would retire. This is how she explains her unrelenting morning workouts: ''A pretty woman has a better chance in business. I used anything I had at my disposal to get the job done.''  When she worked with Milton Petrie (estimated at his death in 1994 to be worth nearly a billion dollars), she says: ''My viewpoint consisted of myself as a career success. It never occurred to me I could ask to get out early for my kids. Having my mother-in-law go for the wedding dress with Lynn worked for me. I realize now it's a pretty narrow way to live.  ''If you never had a fur coat, you never had a two-carat diamond or made $100,000, it seems like a big deal.''  What changed? ''Once you get those things, it's not a big deal. I didn't have a good relationship with my mother. I didn't want to die feeling I didn't have a good relationship with my children. I didn't want to perpetuate a legacy. Where does it stop?''  For a while, the daughter says, she wouldn't let her mother back in: ''She saw I had something with my children. She'd say, 'I probably wasn't as great a mother as you' and I'd let it hang there.''  And then, several years ago, the daughter began writing a novel for young adults and realized the mother character she'd created -- nicknamed the Captain -- was too harsh to be believable. As she rounded out the character, she grew to have empathy for her mother's hard life.  They disagree about who reached out first. ''I threw the baton out, and she grabbed it,'' the daughter says.  Says the mother: ''I worked on being a more accepting mother. If I want to say something, I let it go a day or two before bringing it up. Like negotiating in business.''  Over Christmas, the two families went for a week to Buenos Aires to celebrate the mother's secret milestone birthday. ''The day after we flew back, Mom was in the gym at 7,'' the daughter says. ''I couldn't move.'' Asked what she loves about her mother, she says: ''It took a lot of guts for my mom to change. There's not a thing she wouldn't do for me.''  As for the mother, she has a quippy saying to cover her half: ''Sometimes the chicken can learn from the egg.''  PARENTING  ",

            "text": "  I FIRST noticed the rusting motorbike, which was chained to a fence at Peters Field, on Second Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets, in the summer of 2005. That was when I, a former rock drummer and window cleaner turned stay-at-home dad, began taking my 1-year-old daughter, Annika, to the Augustus St. Gaudens Playground a block away.  On our daily morning and afternoon trips, Annika and I regularly paused at the bike, a Garelli Monza GT, and did our best to look beneath the bike's torn and disheveled cover. Blown almost entirely off the bike by the wind, the wadded clump of grimy vinyl served as an impromptu death shroud for the Garelli's faded bronze-colored frame and predictably flat tires; a ''World Champion'' sticker just below the padded seat was peeling away.  But the headlight of the Italian bike still jutted forward, just as its angular gas tank and pronounced shock absorbers continued to connote its past as a sleek scamp of a bike, a moped doing its best to be a motorcycle. Even then, the Garelli appeared nimble, eager to please if given the chance. On sunny days, I could imagine it speeding off, its engine emitting a high-pitched squeal; a cute piglet racer charging downtown.  So who used to ride the bike? My neighbor Kim, a jazz musician who owns two vintage BMW motorcycles, considers the Garelli a kid's bike, something he would have ridden for fun as a youngster in his hometown, Ribe, in Denmark.  Well, Peters Field does serve as the hard-top playing field for the adjacent Simon Baruch Junior High School. Perhaps the owner attended that school and simply outgrew the moped, leaving it behind when he moved on to high school. Or maybe the parents of that student forbade him to have the bike, and so he had to walk away from his Garelli.  Then again, the School of Visual Arts is just off Second Avenue on 21st Street. Maybe one of the school's students had to choose between her bike and pricey painting supplies, or a camera, or a computer.  Or perhaps the Garelli belonged to a police officer who attended the Police Academy, just three doors up from the School of Visual Arts, and now, years later, he's a member of the Highway Patrol. I like to think that this officer never removed his moped from its wrought-iron resting place because he liked to glimpse it while gunning his Harley-Davidson down Second Avenue escorting some visiting dignitary. It reminded him where he came from.  At some point last week, someone took the Garelli. Maybe the police officer grew nostalgic, or maybe the art student sold a big painting.  Musings and imaginings, for sure, but I definitely can't see myself on the bike. During a long-ago summer in Italy when I was 14, I happily rode a moped on a weekend visit to Naples until I skidded on some cobblestones and nearly got run over by an Alfa Romeo. And motorcycles? I've ridden on one as a passenger only once, just before college. That high-powered BMW shot down a stretch of midnight road at 90 miles per hour, a true thrill ride that was also enough of a ride for me. It's simple: If Lawrence of Arabia can die in a motorcycle accident, I certainly can.  As it is, I've had plenty of close calls riding my own self-propelled two-wheeler: I have been sent airborne by a car, sent sprawling by a pickup, knocked over by a cab. So no motorcycles or mopeds for me. Or even bicycles: I haven't ridden my mountain bike since Annika was born.  Still, I understand the allure of the motorcycle and the idea of vroom-vroom-vrooming away, ''Easy Rider'' and Marlon Brando style. Though I don't own a motorcycle, I have worn my motorcycle jacket for 20 years. Scuffed up, worn in and then some, it cost me $100, and I have since spent $300 to replace the liner, zipper, pockets and even sections of leather. What's more, the thing needs at least $200 worth of further ''restoration'' work.  I ADMIT it. Sometimes I feel like a fake, what with my motorcycle jacket but no motorcycle, especially when I come across Kim revving up one of his cycles outside our respective walk-up apartment buildings. So be it. I'm sure a majority of motorcycle jacket wearers in New York don't own motorcycles. Besides, didn't some people consider Lawrence of Arabia a poseur? So, no. I'm no biker.  I'm also not drumming in bands, and apart from the occasional Saturday job, I'm not cleaning windows, my longtime day job. Instead, as Annika's full-time stay-at-home dad, I take my daughter to the library and play dates, on errands and to the playground. My new day job -- no surprise -- is the antithesis of the motorcycle escape or the rock star life.  That's cool, if unexpected. I just never pictured myself a father. Indeed, when my twin brother's son was born four years ago in Manhattan, I remember telling my mom in the hospital's waiting room, ''I am not ready for this.'' Now I can't picture another sort of life.  When I lift Annika onto my shoulders and we head for the swings, slides and jungle gyms of St. Gaudens, at some level I am, well, her motorcycle, her moped. I take her places. I am her wheels.  The other day while we were washing our clothes, Annika jumped on the scales at the Jin Chen laundry on First Avenue, and we learned that she's now 22 pounds (and would cost $19.10 to be washed, dried and folded, although Tsering Lhundup, a worker there, offered to give us a discount because we're such good customers).  The scales confirmed what my back has been making clear lately: I am hitting my limit of what I can comfortably carry. It may be time to give in, time to put Annika in her stroller, her actual wheels, at least for now. One day, along with my motorcycle jacket, she'll have her own bicycle. Or, perhaps, her own Garelli.  URBAN TACTICS Ivor Hanson is the author of the memoir ''Life on the Ledge: Reflections of a New York City Window Cleaner.''  ",

            "text": "  DEAR DIARY:  Walking hand in hand with Jordie, age 7, and Adam, age 5, Grandpa Fred was heard to say:  ''I'm sorry, boys. I told you, Grandpa doesn't go to see movies where the animals talk.''  Evelyn Malina  Dear Diary:  The other day I got off the Lexington Avenue subway train at 68th Street, and as I trudged up the steep flight of stairs toward the street exit, a black patent-leather high-heeled shoe tumbled down the steps and came to rest at my feet.  I looked up to see an attractive young woman hobbling back down the stairs, where she'd obviously come out of her shoe as she was ascending.  ''Just bought them today, and I knew I should have held out for the smaller size,'' she explained, red-faced.  I kneeled, picked up the shoe, and set it upright on the landing to allow her to slip her foot into it. As she did, I refrained from asking whether it would be a better fit for her wicked stepsisters.  Instead, I cautioned her, ''Be sure you get home before the clock strikes 12.''  Richard Curtis  Dear Diary:  When I arrived home and unpacked my purchases from Staples, I realized that an inexpensive calculator was missing from the bag. I immediately called the store and spoke with the manager, who actually located the calculator at the cash register station I had used.  ''I'll put it in a bag with your name on it'' he said. I gave him my name.  After a moment's silence I heard him say, sotto voce, ''Anybody got a pen? You got something to write with? I need a pen.''  Barry Levine  Dear Diary:  Exiting the subway at Wall Street, I was a little worried at an overheard conversation between a buttoned-down mom and her 5-ish-looking son:  Mom: ''not doing well in school? You need to do well in school, so that you can get into a good college''  Uh-oh, I thought, here comes the guilt trip.  Mom (continuing): ''so that you can become a professional football player.''  Oh. Nicely done, Mom.  Keith Herron  Dear Diary:  As I crossed Broadway above Columbus Circle during the morning rush, with a horde of fellow pedestrians on their way to work, I heard a horn blaring, emanating from an approaching white van.  The van was forced to stop as the group of commuters flocked across Broadway, paying no attention to the vehicle, which in fact had the right of way.  The screech of the horn continued for what seemed like an eternity, so I turned around to get a better look at the culprit. On the side of the van was a painted sign advertising the trade of the vehicle's occupant: Soundproof Window Installation.  Nothing like drumming up a little business whenever the opportunity arises.  Ian M. Waxman  Dear Diary:  While walking along Columbus Avenue, I had the distinct feeling that I was being followed by a large truck to my right.  I then heard my name being called, and there on the street was a fire truck with the driver calling out my name: ''Susan!''  It was a firefighter whom I have known for many years; he plays basketball at the 92nd Street Y, where I work.  As I approached the corner, the fire truck made a left turn, and all the firemen called out ''HELLO SUSAN'' while waving and teasing me. They all sounded like little girls saying hello!  It brought a lot of smiles to all the people around me.  Susan Grucci  Dear Diary:  Car, van and pedestrian traffic through the intersection at 53rd and Lexington during lunch hour is usually very heavy. I was crossing on the south side of the street, heading west.  As I reached the far corner, I noticed pedestrians watching a biker swing around a van that had just run a red light to take a parking space. He continued onto the sidewalk as the van's youngish driver opened his door and stepped down to the sidewalk.  The biker said in a surprisingly even voice, ''That was almost a really bad accident.'' The driver stared at the biker and said simply, ''I'm sorry.'' At that, the biker completed his circling of the van and headed north.  I was stunned. A peaceful exchange that may have made an impact on the van driver, not counting the many bystanders who may have expected a shouting match.  Good grief, I thought. What has this boisterous city come to?  Robert Swain  Metropolitan Diary  ",

            "text": "  The sites were not glamorous -- a raceway in Yonkers, a union hall in Hauppauge on Long Island, the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Wash. -- and the pay was not great, either. He earned anywhere from $50 to $12,000 per fight, and sometimes a night at a discount motel and a day's worth of meal vouchers.  Still, Kemal Kolenovic loved the fighting life unequivocally. At age 28, his record was fairly unremarkable: 10 victories, 6 losses and 2 draws with nine years under his belt as a professional boxer. But even those numbers, if looked at a certain way, owed something to an attitude that valued enthusiasm over rigor and reduced the science of a boxing match to youthful play.  ''He was an all-out brawler, not much of a technical boxer, but he had a blast just throwing punches, and he was good at it,'' said Tony Kalaj, a friend who works for Joe DeGuardia's Star Boxing, a fight promotion company. ''The record? It was hard for him to get fights with his style. He made opponents look stupid.''  Two days ago in the Bronx, Mr. Kolenovic was killed after a barroom brawl in which the police said he had not participated. Sometime after 4:30 a.m. on Sunday, he was run over by a man driving a sport utility vehicle. The man was fleeing the Moonlight Restaurant and Bar on Belmont Avenue, where he and others, but not Mr. Kolenovic, had argued over which Albanian surnames were most associated with tougher and generally superior people.  The men had taken the fight outside. Mr. Kolenovic, who was at the Moonlight with an uncle, Tony Mujovic, 35, had eventually followed them onto the sidewalk and joined a group that had gathered, perhaps just to see what was going on or perhaps, Mr. Mujovic said, to try to get them to break it up. One of the men climbed into a dark sport utility vehicle and plowed into the crowd. The driver fled, and the police said last night that he was still at large.  The S.U.V. hit Mr. Kolenovic and threw him headfirst into a tree. He was pronounced dead shortly afterward at St. Barnabas Hospital.  ''We sat around reviewing what the security camera got,'' said Al Kolenovic, a cousin. ''You see Kemal sitting outside, wanting to leave. The poor guy's got his hands in his pockets, with his back to the car. He didn't know what hit him.''  Yesterday at midday, three or four dozen men who said they were cousins of Mr. Kolenovic gathered in Astoria, Queens, at the Islamic Unity and Culture Center of Plav-Gusinje, a Muslim mosque that serves the city's Montenegrin community.  About half of them sat around folding tables in the basement; the rest spilled outside, onto the corner of 12th Street and 31st Avenue. They were long-faced and mostly with dark hair, and a good number of them smoked cigarettes in the rain. The women in their lives -- sisters, spouses, mothers -- were inside, upstairs with scarves over their heads, kneeling in front of prayer mats.  ''Right now, it's the women's turn,'' Al Kolenovic said. ''And then the men again. Both groups do it five times a day until the deceased has his burial. Pretty sad story.''  He said the burial was to take place today at a Balkan cemetery in Monticello, N.Y., pending the approval of the boxer's mother, Sanija Kolenovic. She flew from her home in Germany and was due to arrive at the mosque at any minute.  Several friends from the boxing community had been by to pay their respects, including Elvir Muriqi, an Albanian whose boxing nickname is the Kosovo Kid. Joe Antonacci, a ring announcer, described Mr. Kolenovic as ''a beautiful person in a brutal, lonely, thankless game.''  ''He had such charisma in the ring,'' Mr. Antonacci went on. ''He looked like Brian Setzer from the Stray Cats -- that blond hair combed back. He had a big Albanian following, obviously. But he couldn't go into an arena and not make fans. He was a nonstop movement fighter, fast hands, lots of spirit.''  Mr. Kolenovic fought as a welterweight. He was 5-foot-7 and weighed about 150 pounds. He came to Brooklyn from Montenegro in 1993, when he was 14 or 15, without his parents. He worked construction and washed dishes in restaurants to pay rent. He lived in Midwood.  Mr. Kolenovic worked with a few trainers in his career. The last was Chelo Betancourt, who worked with him at Gleason's Gym in Dumbo.  ''He was such a tough kid, a lot of championship fighters liked to spar with him because he could take it and he could adjust his style to match any fighter,'' Mr. Betancourt said. ''Antonio Diaz brought him out to Texas when he was training for a title fight, paid him $150 a day to stay out there and spar for a few weeks.''  In 2003, Mr. Kolenovic beat Fontaine Cabell for the New York State welterweight title. ''The promoters were looking for a walkover opponent, but we prepared good,'' Mr. Betancourt said. He said that Mr. Kolenovic won by technical knockout ''by counterpunching the whole way,'' and that ''he shocked everybody.''  The following year, Mr. Kolenovic lost his title defense, also by technical knockout. Mr. Betancourt said that he was underprepared because he had been spending more time drinking with friends than in the gym, and that he had advised him not to take the fight when he did.  At times, said Mr. Kalaj, the promoter: ''They threw him in with the wolves. He got robbed a lot by hometown referees.''  Around 3 p.m. yesterday, the car driving Mr. Kolenovic's mother pulled up at the mosque. She sobbed as she was escorted inside and up the stairs. When she approached her son's body in the open coffin, she clutched her head, dropped to her knees, and screamed.  All the men upstairs stood at the side of the room, while the women surrounded Mr. Kolenovic's body, also crying. Mrs. Kolenovic, who cried the loudest, took her son's face in her hands and held it.

            "text": "  It's perched above the Hudson like a rickety Irish time capsule -- a country store and pub where there's coffee and doughnuts for commuters every morning, Bud and Guinness for the bar crowd every night, live Irish music the first Thursday after every full moon and small revelations most nights in between.  It's where Tom Endres used to row surreptitiously across the river when he was a cadet at West Point and visits still, where Wendy Bounds wandered in one day two months after 9/11 and a few years later emerged with a book called ''Little Chapel on the River,'' where the cast of characters over the years has included Andy the opera singing bartender, Lou-Lou the dog and Fionnuala the swan.  And most of all, from the moment an Irish immigrant named Jim Guinan opened the place by the railroad tracks in 1959 with $316, it's been where the Guinan family has managed to defy time and space. It's where Jim lives above the store when's he's not ministering to the flock, where his son John picked up the mantle to keep it going three years back, where the off-center shamrock still graces the fireplace and the cash register is the 1927 Federal that's as big as a boat anchor. At Guinan's it may not be 1959, but it sure ain't 2007.  So while the announcement in The Putnam County News & Recorder last week didn't come as a complete surprise, it still came as a shock, as jarring as a world where cows flew, horses sang ''Danny Boy'' and there was no Guinan's on Garrison's Landing.  ''To all our valued customers and friends,'' began the letter from John Guinan. ''It becomes my sad duty to inform you that after 48 years of business we will be closing our doors for good.'' There was a reference to health issues that made it impossible to stay open, and there were thanks for everyone's love and support. ''January 31 will be our last day -- we will be open all day. Please join us for a final beer and toast to family and good friends.''  In truth, this was not the first time Guinan's had glimpsed its own demise. Two years after it opened, Jim Guinan almost packed it in until a new lease arrangement made it feasible to continue. Then after Jim's wife, Peg, died in 1988, as his diabetes got worse in the 1990s, as people wondered who these days could run a country store that caters to both the commuters catching the 4:44 a.m. train and the drinkers at night, it was as if the shadow of mortality was always just around the corner. For those who philosophized about Guinan's -- which meant almost everyone who walked in the door -- it sank in that Guinan's was living on borrowed time.  And then the philosophical became real. Last fall, John Guinan, the rock who kept the thing going, felt a numbness on his left side when driving to open the store one morning. He suffered a seizure on the way to the hospital and was found to have a malignant brain tumor. His ad was simply a recognition of the obvious -- without John to run it, there could be no Guinan's.  But then, if this were a wholly rational world, there probably couldn't be a Guinan's anyway. And as the word leaked out, even before the ad ran, a group of regulars gathered at the bar to figure out a way to cheat time once more. The first thought was they needed Guinan's for what it meant to them -- the coffee for the commuters, the beer and companionship at night. The second was they needed Guinan's for what it meant for the family, especially Jim Guinan, now 81, who had lived there since 1959.  IDEAS were kicked around about how people could help. Among others, Mary Ellen Yannitelli, whose husband's family once owned the place before the Guinans, said she could work a day a week and do whatever was needed.  On Monday, two days before it was supposed to close, John Guinan's sister Margaret, a police detective, agreed to run it for another year and his daughter, Kelly, agreed to help. ''It helps in lots of ways,'' said John Guinan. ''It gives Dad a place to live. It gives the customers a way to enjoy the store for a time frame longer. It's another way friendship, human duct tape as Wendy put it, keeps this place going.''  Maybe you can't live on borrowed time forever. But the next full moon is Friday. The following Thursday, there will be Irish music at Guinan's. The beer will flow. The walls will shake. The green shamrock will shimmer over the Hudson. And time will have to wait another year -- a good bit more if the faithful are lucky -- to get paid back.  OUR TOWNS E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com  ",

            "text": "  The public seating in Room 25 of the Circuit Criminal Court complex in Dublin is not designed for comfort. The half-dozen rows of benches are wooden and narrow, with barely enough room for your knees. I spent the better part of October trying not to fidget in those pews, sitting, as I was, just a few paces away from the defendant, who was under strict orders from her lawyer not to fidget at all.  In this court the defendant sat apart and alone, on a separate bench, directly opposite the jury, while the lawyers for both sides shared a large wooden table. For nearly a month this defendant followed her orders well; while I squirmed, she stared purposefully ahead, rarely looking directly at anyone, though once in a while I accidentally caught her eye.  Her name was Noreen Mulholland. She was a nurse. She was in this courtroom charged with assaulting two patients in her care. In the Irish tabloid headlines she was ''the Naas Nurse,'' after the town where the supposed crimes were to have occurred.  She had also been my children's baby sitter.  I met Noreen in 1994 when she answered an ad I placed in our suburban New York newspaper seeking help on Saturday nights. My son Alex was a newborn then, and Evan had just turned 3. The occasional weekend night became every week -- and also whenever our au pair was sick, or I had to travel for work, or we needed an extra pair of hands. At one point, when Noreen was between apartments, she lived in our spare room. At another point, so she could make extra money, I hired her to clean the house. My friends grabbed the rest of her time, and after school every day she cared for a little boy who was Alex's best preschool friend. My world and Noreen's were loosely, but definitely, entwined.  One day, when Alex was about 5, he said he didn't want Noreen to come anymore. ''Noreen scares me,'' he said, but could not, or would not, explain further. By then I'd known her long enough and -- I thought -- well enough that I owed her the benefit of the doubt. I told her what Alex had said. I hoped she would answer as I like to think I would if I learned that a child was afraid of me -- with concern, or at least an explanation, maybe an apology, an offer to help make things right. Instead she said, ''You know, Lisa, kids lie.''  James Joyce, whose spirit is everywhere in Dublin, once said, ''In the particular is contained the universal.'' This is about child care only in its particulars. It is not a tale of evil nannies lurking around every corner, or a declaration that children are not safe with anyone other than their mothers. More universally, it is about trust, and the harsh reality that as well as you ever know anyone, you can know only what he or she allows you to see.  We know this, and yet we trust. We trust strangers not to poison our food in their restaurants, not to drive drunk when we board their buses. We trust loved ones, even though each year brings news stories of husbands leading double lives, wives whose hidden demons cause them to kill. We hire office workers after a few hours of interviews, at best, and trust them not to steal or destroy all that we have built. We go to a doctor based only on the fact that our neighbor seems to like him. We hand employers our Social Security numbers, and valets our car keys, and bank tellers our balances, and nannies our children.  When I learned that Noreen was in trouble, in May 2004, my first question was ''What has she done?'' I knew she had gotten her nursing degree and moved to Ireland after we'd parted ways, but I had no idea how to reach her. The news reports I could find online were sketchy, alluding to possible exhumations, a planned review of the cases of any patients she might have cared for and a hot line relatives could call if they thought their loved one had been harmed by the Naas Nurse. ''Did She Poison Them?'' screamed a headline in The Irish Daily Mirror, next to a prominent photo of the woman who used to give baths to my boys. But what none of these stories told me was what exactly she was accused of. Was she a serial killer? An ''angel of mercy''? A screw-up? An innocent victim of a false accusation? Or some combination of the above?  My second wave of questions, following milliseconds behind the first, began with, ''What had I done?'' As a reporter, it is part of my job to size people up quickly -- to know (or at least wonder) if they are lying or sublimating or telling a story that isn't linear and complete. I had sized up Noreen and welcomed her into my family. Along the way there were hints that everything was not perfect. But no human being is perfect, and to have a relationship, any relationship, means to decide which imperfections we choose to accept. I accepted, even embraced, Noreen's. Until Alex said that she scared him.  I became all but obsessed with getting answers to these questions, which is how I found myself two years later in a Dublin courtroom, trying not to stare too blatantly at Noreen while she tried not to glance my way. By then I had learned that she was not a serial killer, in fact she was not a killer at all, and despite the flurry of headlines and hysteria, she would, in the end, be charged in just two cases, and in both instances she was accused of assault and giving an unprescribed drug. But that was about all I could learn from afar. I needed to hear the evidence from the mouths of those who accused and defended her and decide the facts of the case firsthand. I needed to know if I was right to have trusted this woman long ago. Even more, I needed to know if I could continue to trust myself.  Many details of my years with Noreen Mulholland are fuzzy, but others are crisp, and among the clearest are those of the first time we met. I was a sleep-deprived mother of an infant and a toddler 12 years ago, looking for a way to go to dinner and a movie on Saturday nights. I couldn't believe my luck when this Irish burst of energy all but blew into my house for an interview.  She was 23, curvy in a comforting way, with auburn hair, a warm smile and the habit of calling everyone ''Love.'' Until that moment I didn't know that I carried an image of the nurturing Irish nanny, but she filled it completely. Then, as always, her hair was perfectly cut, her makeup smoothly applied. She took pride in looking good and, I would later see, in doing things right. ''It's O.K., Love,'' she might have said to Alex as she offered to take him from me and then rocked him on her knees while we talked. She had the sure moves of someone who had done this before.  One of the first things she told me was that she was determined to become a nurse. Her mother had been a nurse, and it was all Noreen ever wanted. She was a teenager when her mother died, from a brain aneurysm, at 41. I'm not sure if she mentioned her mother during that first interview, but I am positive she talked about her own nursing goals, because it was a large part of the reason I hired her. Nursing is shorthand for caring and competence. It says, ''I don't shirk from the messy'' and ''I have smarts and ambition beyond being just your baby sitter.'' What more could a mother want?  Well, glowing references from a former employer, for starters. And Noreen didn't have those. She described her depth of baby-sitting experience -- much of it back home, then several years with a family here in the States. As I recall, she then said she preferred that I not contact that family. Things ended badly, she told me. She loved the kids but felt friction with the mother, who, by Noreen's description, was jealous that the nanny was better with the children.  I didn't hire her entirely without references, though. As it happened, she was dating the son of a woman who worked in the local school district, and that woman described Noreen as kind and hardworking and lovely. I also went ahead and called the family Noreen had asked me not to speak to. The mother wasn't home, so I spoke to the father, who basically said that his wife felt it was time for a change. Anyone who has ever checked references knows that is code for volumes more.  And yet I hired her. I remember wondering whether this young woman might be the type who always insisted she was right, and if one day I would be the one she complained about to the next prospective employer. On the other hand, she would be coming only on Saturday nights, which the children spent mostly asleep. I gambled because I trusted the warmth she showed while holding Alex. I was relieved to have found someone who spoke fluent English and was more mature than a neighborhood teenager. The delightful brogue, I confess, didn't hurt.  As it turned out, she was wonderful with the boys. Alex loved when she baby-sat, and even more when she came to clean, because she would wave the vacuum wand over his Dutch-boy haircut and make his hair stand out straight from his head. She seemed to love him back. One afternoon when she wasn't working, she was at a neighborhood pool with a friend and an announcement came over the loudspeakers that a child named Alex was missing. The next day she told me how frantic she felt for the moment when she wondered if it might be ''our Alex.''  We would chat in my kitchen while she took a break from cleaning and I took a break from writing. I have two sons, and while she was too old to be like a daughter, she certainly added some welcome girl talk to my life. I don't remember much of what I told her, mostly stories about the boys, I think. She, in turn, told me stories of her family back home -- of her father, whom she didn't speak to; of land her mother had left her that some relatives tried to steal; of an argument over her mother's headstone.  I heard a lot about her love life too -- a series of relationships that seemed particularly tumultuous. In the last, and most serious, of these, she lived for more than three years with a man who, to her dismay, would not propose.  I wondered along the way, as I had the day we'd met -- what was it about this woman that she was always being wronged? I kept those thoughts to myself, though, and instead I tried to help, offering advice, lending an ear. She had no health insurance, so I sent her to my doctor for flu shots and chicken pox vaccines and paid the bill. I proofread her application for nursing school and wrote a letter of recommendation. When she was wait-listed, I called the dean and told her they would never have an applicant who was more determined to become a nurse. She was accepted.  Going to school full time while still working nearly full time took its toll over the coming months. She became tired and snappish. Which is why when Alex said, ''Noreen scares me,'' I was not as alarmed as I might have been. She was burned out, and she screamed at him. That's what I believed then. I still believe that now. Lord knows, I had been known to do the same. I knew she had a temper -- although I had never heard her raise her voice to a child, I had witnessed her displays of anger at those she felt had wronged her over the years, and I'd heard her describe it herself when telling me how she'd thrown her boyfriend's clothes out of the apartment during an argument and screamed at his mother over the phone that he didn't appreciate her. I could imagine that she'd snapped and turned that temper on my boys. Not acceptable, but not a crime.  Unacceptable, though, was her answer when I'd asked about it. ''You know, Lisa, kids lie.'' Once again she was the victim. Once again she was in the right and the other guy (my kindergartner) was in the wrong. This time it was too close to home, and it was the last conversation we would have for several years. I simply stopped calling her with work.  I heard through friends that she finished nursing school, with honors, and returned home. She would have preferred to have stayed in the States, but her arguments with that boyfriend over marriage had reached the point at which she'd threatened to go back home if there was no wedding, and in the end he called her bluff. ''I would have married the girl,'' he told me one recent morning, when he appeared at my door after learning I had been at the trial. ''But not because she was telling me to. If only I'd have married her, none of this would have happened.''  When I next saw Noreen, it was in a jam-packed Irish courtroom, nearly five years after her work for me ended. She all but collapsed in my arms. We had talked on the phone a few times, but she hadn't received the e-mail message that said I'd be coming. When she saw me, her knees buckled and I had to grab her arms to keep her from hitting the ground. It took but a few moments for her to compose herself, though. ''I'm not allowed to cry, no emotion, I can't let them see me cry,'' she kept saying, as she put her game face back on. By ''they'' she meant the cameramen outside and the print reporters inside.  This courtroom, in November 2004, was in Naas, about an hour outside Dublin. Noreen was there for a hearing to ask for a change of venue, which was granted. As we left the courthouse, it became clear why her lawyers did not want her to be tried in Naas. Cameramen yelled her name as they followed her down the block and around the corner toward her car.  She was out on bail and was required to check in with her local police station every Monday and Friday. She had been planning to drive directly back home after the hearing, but I talked her into letting me buy her lunch. She chose a restaurant that didn't have a TV in the bar so that she wouldn't have to see herself on the midday news while she ate. The dining room of the restaurant was decorated like a living room, and we sat side by side on a cozy couch with a low table in front of us.  She asked me why I had come. I told her, honestly, that I wasn't sure. Part of me, I think, wanted to save her. She was in over her head, and I wanted to help. Part of me, though, wanted to shake her and demand to know what she had done. Had she lost her temper? Had she lost her mind? And then there was the part of me that knew I might be writing this article. I wasn't certain I would, but I told her that day that I might, and I took notes while we talked. My pad on the table was my way of reminding us both that while our roles and emotions were muddled, I was very much a reporter.  I asked how she was doing. ''My life's on hold,'' she said. She'd had to sell her house near Naas and move to Northern Ireland, where she qualified for welfare. Once there she spent her days reading the growing file on her case, calling it ''my homework,'' and exercising like a demon at a nearby gym. She'd lost weight and viewed herself as training for a fight.  Gradually we inched toward the subject of the case itself. What, exactly, had she done? She had been charged with harming John Gethings and Seamus Doherty, both elderly men in very poor health, when they were admitted to Naas General Hospital in 2003. Noreen was accused of giving each man an injection with the drug haloperidol, known by the brand name Serenace in Ireland (and as Haldol in the U.S.). An antipsychotic, it is also used as a sedative for agitated patients. Gethings died. Doherty was, at the time, still living but in a nursing home. (He would die, of unrelated causes, in March 2006. An autopsy later showed that Gethings's death was not caused by Serenace.)  Noreen told me in an earlier phone conversation that she had learned of the charges one afternoon when a supervisor called ''out of the blue'' and said that all her shifts were canceled. She had been working at Naas General for about six months when she got that call in July 2003 and thought she had formed good friendships with other nurses there. When she went down to meet with the administrator, she described being stunned to see ''my best friend's handwriting'' on a complaint report.  From these sketchy descriptions, I gathered that she was accused of giving each man an injection with an unnecessarily large needle in a way that caused pain. She also told me she was accused of throwing a glass of water at one patient and saying, ''If you don't shut up, you'll get another'' injection. But she had done none of those things, she said. Whatever other facts were out there would be kept sealed under the Irish system until the actual trial, so for now all I had was Noreen's assurance that this was all a mistake, a vendetta by co-workers who turned out not to be her friends.  She suspected that they were jealous, she said, since she had trained in the States and was better at nursing than they were. ''My colleagues just hadn't a clue,'' she said. ''Their technology was decades behind.'' Periodically, she said, she would ask herself: '' 'Where the hell am I?' They're doing backward nursing here. I'd tell myself, 'Just blend in, do the best you can.' '' And yet, she said, she made sure everyone knew she graduated with honors from nursing school, and she often wore her gold honors' society pin on her white nursing blouse and was proud that the others had nicknamed her the Professor.  As the hours passed at lunch that day, Noreen talked more about her past. She described a childhood spent watching her father regularly beat her mother. Noreen wanted to be a nurse not for the reason I'd thought -- to follow in the footsteps of a beloved mother -- but because she was determined to avoid her mother's fate. ''I wasn't going that route,'' she said. ''I wasn't going to be pregnant and dependent, with a bruised face.''  In a way her ambition was a different kind of homage to her mother. ''I knew I could nurse because I had been my mother's nurse,'' she said. ''I knew really young to get the wet cold cloths. I knew which were the old towels and to use those to clean up the blood.''  Sometime during her childhood her father was sent to prison for bludgeoning a man in a bar fight. She was glad when he went away, she said, because he couldn't hit her mother when he was in jail. Her mother made plans to go back to school and continue the work that had been interrupted when she'd had children, but before she could finish, she died. With nothing left for her back home, Noreen left for the U.S. and did not return until the fight with her boyfriend in 2001. Her father died in February 2004, a few months after Noreen saw him for the first time in more than 16 years.  My mind was reeling. I was scanning through mental snapshots of what I had known of her life and seeing them through this new lens. Her choice of problematic men -- a re-creation of her relationship with her father? Her inability to see herself as in the wrong -- a response to a lifetime of being told that she was? Her determination not to ask for help -- a belief that she was completely on her own?  I might well have hugged her then and told her everything would be O.K., when she went one thought too far. In the dimming late afternoon light, she turned to me and said, ''One Christmas you wrote me a note saying that I must have come from a loving family to show such love.''  She took a deep breath and looked me straight in the eye. ''Wow, did I put one over on you.''  Her voice was steel. Icy. Scary. She seemed pleased with the pain her words could cause.  I know we stayed longer and talked more, but I have no record of what was said because I all but stopped writing after those words exploded between us. I felt blindsided, deceived, ill. Somehow the conversation came around to the question I had gone all that way to ask, a question that seemed trivial against the enormity of what I now knew.  What had happened to frighten Alex?  Her answer is the last thing written on my pad from lunch that day: ''I was burned out. I was a cleaner. I was taking care of four walls, not the people within them. If your kids got me before a certain time, they got singing and playing and fun. After a certain time, I held back. I wanted my own children someday, and when they would do certain things I knew I would say, 'That's just like Alex, or Evan, or Eli.' I didn't want that. I needed to save something for my own children.''  The relationship between a mother and the woman she hires to care for her children is filled with unspoken truths. The mother does not say out loud that she expects the nanny to have more patience, more time, more energy than she has for herself. The nanny does not say, in turn, that this is just a job, and that you cannot love a stranger's children as your own. The mother wants the nanny to give love, and the children to return that love -- but not too much. The nanny has opinions, based on experience, but she knows enough to keep most of them to herself.  I know mothers who do all they can to make it a business relationship, with charts and lists and performance evaluations -- the better to be able to end things if the situation starts to sour. I know others who embrace their nanny as a friend -- as if knowing her every thought, the wheres and whos of every Saturday night, will keep the children safe. The first group always seems to feel that their relationship is cold, and the second that things are too fraught.  I spent a lot of time in the months after I returned from Ireland replaying Noreen's words -- ''Wow, did I put one over on you''-- and trying to decide why they hit me with such force. I couldn't get over the feeling that she had lied -- if not by commission then by omission. Why had she not told me about her tortured childhood?  I fully understood why she didn't walk in the door and tell so deep and personal a secret at our first interview. It's not something you would share with a stranger. Besides, had I somehow known everything from the start, she would have been right to fear that I might not have hired her. I know the scientific literature. Abusers have often been abused themselves or witnessed abuse. Of course I also know that the reverse is not true -- a history of abuse does not make you an abuser. But while I would have been -- and still am -- impressed by Noreen's determination to escape her mother's fate, I might not have taken a chance when the job was caring for my children.  If she had a right to her secrets, though, then why did they feel like lies? What rattled me, I came to see, was that Noreen had kept up a facade for five years. On the spectrum of business relationship to friendship, ours tipped well toward the friendship end. I listened. I gave advice. I cared. In exchange, she knew what went on in my house and saw me in those private, unguarded moments we all try to keep to ourselves.  So was I angry because I'd treated Noreen as a friend, and friends are expected to share? That was my conclusion -- at first. But as I examined my anger, I had to confront the uncomfortable fact that I was too often only going through the motions of friendship with Noreen. I asked about her life more often than I told her about mine. I pried more than I shared. I wanted to keep her close and earn her trust because I cared about her, yes, but also because I needed regular reassurance that she was good for my children. Sincerity mixed with strategy.  ''Wow, did I put one over on you.'' I believed that Noreen believed we'd had a friendship. With one sentence she made it clear that I had been fooling only myself.  For two years after that meeting in the fall of 2004, we kept in touch by e-mail and occasional phone calls, she on her side of the Atlantic, going to the gym and preparing to testify, me on mine, pondering the meaning of the truth. I recognized that I was wearing a mask of my own during that time. Even as I sent her birthday packages of Dunkin' Donuts coffee and cheerful notes telling her to hang in there, I had doubts about her innocence. Couldn't the woman who snapped at my children have snapped at a patient? Couldn't the woman who'd kept truths from me also keep them from the police? I didn't share my doubts, reasoning that I would not really know what I thought until I'd heard the evidence. I wasn't lying; I was keeping an open mind.  Yet I knew she expected that I was there to rescue her and support her. Her belief in me was made clear about a year before the trial, which began this October, when she asked if I would be a character witness. It was as awkward a conversation as I've ever had. On the heels of her question she started to tell me what I should be careful not to mention -- particularly details of her romances (since she feared the prosecution would suggest that rocky relationships led her to seek revenge on helpless men in her care) and what I now knew about her father (for the same reason). In response, I hemmed and hawed and don't remember uttering a coherent sentence. What I most definitely did not say was this: ''I can't be a character witness because I'm afraid what I have to say would hurt your case.''  Noreen was not the only one to whom I was telling just a part of the truth. I had met a postal deliveryman named Thomas Gethings while I was at the change-of-venue hearing in Naas. His father was one of Noreen's supposed victims -- the only patient whose body was actually exhumed as part of the investigation -- and Tom and I, too, corresponded via e-mail over the next two years. He told me about his father, a truck driver and quiet, unassuming man. He told me how the exhumation had devastated the family, particularly his youngest sister, who insisted on staying by the graveside and watching as the coffin was lifted back out of the earth.  Everything I told him about myself was correct -- that I was a reporter for this magazine, that I specialized in medical issues, that I would be writing an article about the case. But I didn't share the all of it. If I had, I reasoned, Tom would have questions, and I was not yet sure of the answers.  With every e-mail message, though, I debated what to do. Do I tell too soon -- before I knew Tom enough to trust him not to betray a confidence? Or do I tell too late -- after Tom trusted me and might well feel deceived? I couldn't help seeing, in my journalistic quandary, a parallel to Noreen. Had she wrestled with when or whether to tell me her secrets when we were talking like friends? Had she struggled with finding the right moment -- and fearing that she might have let it pass?  In our short notes and phone calls over the months, Noreen mentioned her hesitancy to go out on dates. ''What do I tell them about this mess,'' she said of the charges and the looming trial, '' 'I'm a nurse, but I'm taking a break?' '' Then, in passing, she mentioned a young man named Sean whom she met online. A short while later she called to say they were engaged. ''I broke all the rules and told him everything on the first date,'' she said. ''He had a flat mate, a male nurse, who had been falsely accused, so he understood me right away.''  I almost didn't recognize Noreen when I saw her again this past October in Dublin as the trial got under way. All that exercise had left her fit and thin, and all the strain had left her drawn and pale. She had grown her hair longer than I was used to seeing it and dyed it black instead of the soft auburn I knew. I wanted to take her out for a haircut and highlights. She looked severe. ''Like a wicked witch,'' Tom Gethings said during the first day of trial. I imagined that the jury would see her that way too.  That jury was sworn in after lunch on the first day -- six men and six women. Judge Frank O'Donnell took the bench, and within a few witnesses, the prosecution's case, which I had wondered about for two years, was made clear. Both John Gethings and Seamus Doherty were ''quite unwell,'' in the understatement of the prosecutor, Orla Crowe. The men were patients on the Curragh Ward -- an acute-care ward -- of Naas General Hospital. Noreen was the nurse responsible for each of the men on the two nights in question. Each man was described as calling out in the night, disturbing the other patients.  Two different nurses described two separate times when Noreen, agitated by the noise, jumped up from her seat at the nurses' station in the middle of the night, went into the room where the drugs were stored and locked and then headed toward the patient's room with a loaded syringe.  Sharon Baxter, the nurse who witnessed the injection of Gethings, testified first. In the predawn hours on March 1, 2003, she said, as Gethings was yelling, ''I'm dying, I'm dying,'' Noreen ''jumped out of her seat and ran into our treatment room across the hall where we keep our medications. She said something along the lines of, 'I need to shut him up, he's waking them all up, I need to give him something.' ''  Baxter described Noreen as taking a vial of Serenace from the drug cabinet and drawing it into a syringe. ''Is the drug prescribed?'' Baxter recalled asking. Noreen said that it was but walked away with the syringe before Baxter could follow the protocol for any intramuscular injection -- checking the dose, expiration date and method of administration against the chart.  ''She had the medication drawn up very quickly into the syringe and she left the room,'' Baxter said. ''I followed her out. She went straight to the patient's room.'' The curtain around Gethings's bed -- Bed No. 2 -- was pulled, Baxter said, and Noreen ''had rolled him onto his side.'' Baxter stood by the man's head and reassured him, saying: ''The nurse is going to give you a little injection, it will help you sleep, it will feel like a little prick. You're not dying, you're going to be all right.''  Looking down the bed, Baxter described how Noreen ''very roughly, very brutally, drew back her arm a lot more than required to give the injection, so she gave it with a lot of force.'' When asked to demonstrate by the prosecutor, Baxter raised her own fist over her shoulder, with her elbow bent so that it pointed straight ahead and her arm was parallel to the floor. Then she brought it down from that height into the imaginary patient beneath her in the bed. It looked as if it would hurt. ''As she was withdrawing the needle from the patient, I looked to see what had happened,'' Baxter said. ''It was a 16-gauge needle, a white needle, NEVER used for giving an injection.  ''I asked her if she had meant to give it with that needle,'' Baxter said.  ''What did Miss Mulholland say to you?'' the prosecutor asked.  ''She laughed.''  Later, Sinead Noone-Norton, the nurse who witnessed the injection of Seamus Doherty, took the stand. The tale she told was different only in the details. Another night shift, this one on June 18, 2003. Another agitated patient, calling out and waking the others. Doherty, who was a sheep farmer, was not sure where he was and was ranting about tractors. ''Noreen said she was going to give him something to calm him down,'' Noone-Norton said. ''She went off into the treatment room to prepare her injection. I waited for her to call me in or bring me the injection to check out the vial.'' Instead, ''she walked by me very quickly.''  ''I walked into the room,'' she said. ''The curtains had been pulled'' around Bed No. 9, Doherty's bed. ''Behind them she was drawing the injection into a syringe using a white needle. She pushed Seamus over onto his left side. She launched the needle at him. It was done very roughly.  ''Seamus yelped. He started yelling 'Help' again, and Noreen was saying, 'Shut up.' There was half a glass of water on the bedside. Noreen threw it in his face and told him to shut up.  ''I stepped outside the curtains. I was in shock. I just took some deep breaths. I walked back in. Noreen was standing there. She had the white needle held up in her fist, up like this.'' Noone-Norton held up her hand as if grabbing a knife by the handle, blade down, ready to plunge. ''She wasn't expecting to see me this second time. I said, 'What are you doing?' She said, 'Just threatening him.' ''  Needles of different thicknesses are topped in different colors of plastic to easily tell them apart. The lower the gauge of a needle, the thicker it is. An orange needle, the thinnest under this system, is used for subcutaneous injections, meaning those that go into the layers of skin. A blue needle, in turn, is 23-gauge and used for intramuscular injections, or IMs; you'd probably get your flu vaccine with this. A green needle is 21-gauge and used less often, usually with drugs of a slightly more syrupy consistency. A white needle is 16-gauge and is intended to draw medication into a syringe; that needle is then unscrewed and a smaller needle or an IV mechanism is attached to the syringe.  After each nurse's testimony, the prosecutor asked that the jury be shown the white needle. Not the exact one used in these incidents, since those needles were disposed of long ago, but an example of a 16-gauge version. First it was given to the nurse, who held it up in the witness box. It was so thick that it could be seen across the room, where the jury sat. It looked like a dart. The tip of a ballpoint pen. A weapon. Then it was passed around the jury box, where it had the desired effect. A few of the jurors -- and more than a few of the spectators -- cringed.  Those two stories formed the basis of the assault charge. It is worth underlining here that Noreen was not accused of anything worse than assault. Gethings died at 11 on the morning of March 1; Doherty, according to his family, was never the same after the night of June 18. But the prosecutor and the state pathologist all made clear during the trial that the injection of Serenace did not cause death or long-term harm. The case the prosecution did make was that Noreen gave the injections brutally, tantamount to assault, and that because the Serenace was not prescribed it fell under the definition of poisoning, which was the second charge in each case. Again, Nurses Baxter and Noone-Norton told similar stories that differed in their details. Baxter testified that she had checked Gethings's chart soon after the incident and that it said Serenace had been prescribed P.O. (by mouth) once per night. Noreen had already given him that tablet earlier in her shift.  Baxter said she is absolutely certain that there was no prescription for an injection of Serenace. By the time the chart made its way to the police investigators, however, the notation IM was written in next to the P.O., an addition that would allow for an intramuscular injection. That addition was in black marker, in contrast to the black ink of the rest of the writing on the entry. The implication was that someone -- Noreen? -- had changed the chart.  On Doherty's chart, in contrast, there was no prescription for Serenace at all. Nor was there a prescription for any sort of injection. Here the defense made the case, in cross-examination of Noone-Norton, that Noreen had paged a doctor who had approved the prescription over the phone. But Noone-Norton said no mention was made that night of a doctor and that none had come to see Doherty.  Noreen's lawyer, Giollaiosa O'Lideadha, did his best. He grilled Baxter and Noone-Norton, as well as the corroborating staff members, about every moment of the nights in question -- where they were standing, how quickly the incidents happened -- in an attempt to cast doubt about whether they had actually been able to see what they said they had seen. Was it really a white needle in Noreen's hand, or did it go by too quickly? Did Noreen actually say, ''Shut him up,'' or might she have said, ''I'll give him something to keep him quiet''? Wasn't it true that record-keeping at Naas General Hospital was full of omissions, and hastily scribbled additions, and orders that were never written down? Why did Baxter wait four months and Noone-Norton nearly two weeks to come forward with their accusations? They talked to each other before they filed their complaints, and they talked again after Baxter testified in court but before Noone-Norton took the stand -- was this not collusion?  Just when I started to think that collusion was going to be the crux of the case -- after all, Noreen had described this all along as a vendetta -- O'Lideadha went in another direction entirely. He asked Baxter (and, later, Noone-Norton) whether one's view of a situation is colored by the facts you know. If you see two men energetically fighting on the street, he said, you might call the police unless you knew that the men were brothers and that they often went at each other in good-natured tussles. Baxter warily agreed that this was true.  Then he asked if Noreen seemed ''competent, assertive and confident.'' Well, yes, Baxter agreed. What if that impression, O'Lideadha continued, gathering steam, was based on an incomplete knowledge of the facts?  ''Did anybody tell you that Miss Mulholland did not complete her year of nursing training at Blackrock?'' (a well-respected clinic in Dublin) O'Lideadha asked. ''That she only lasted there nine months? Were you told that Miss Mulholland's mentor at Blackrock, after a short period, asked that she mentor with someone else, basically because Miss Mulholland was 'not picking up what I am teaching her?' Would it be a surprise to you to know that she was dismissed from Blackrock because her clinical skills were not acceptable? Because senior staff there were unable to assign surgical or complex patients to her? Because she was unable to call for assistance? Because Noreen did not achieve the clinical level to do night-nursing duty?''  Behind me, John Gethings's daughter turned pale and his sons turned pink. I turned inward, remembering, again, the young woman who refused to admit that she was wrong. I had come to hear what happened, and now that I had, I wanted to flee. If there was a single moment in the monthlong trial when I became certain that the charges against Noreen were true, it was this one. Her lawyer's point was that Noreen was incompetent, that if she used the wrong needle it was ineptitude, not aggression. But to me the horror lay not with the white-topped needle but with her white-hot anger. O'Lideadha described a woman who could lash out and then lie about it rather than admit a mistake. I recognized that woman. I'd seen her before.  The new certainty made me angry. Why, I thought, could Noreen not have said, ''I was wrong''? Or some version of those words, like, ''I'm stressed out and snapped at Alex,'' or ''I lost it with a patient, I need help''? If she had said that to me, we would never have parted ways. If she'd said it to the Naas supervisor, the case might have remained a disciplinary matter and never have made it to the police or to the jury. But she couldn't admit fault -- even to herself. I was furious with her.  ''The senior nurse at Blackrock will testify that Noreen did not accept her clinical limitations,'' O'Lideadha continued. ''She considered herself an expert. She had a fear of being portrayed as needing help.'' Not only that, he added, Noreen also did not accept the criticisms in this line of defense. ''She disagrees with this evaluation of her abilities,'' he said.  A fight on the street -- two thugs going at it? Or two brothers horsing around?  A nurse botching an injection -- a deliberate disregard for the patient? Or pathetic incompetence?  That nurse laughing about it afterward -- callous cruelty? Or an attempt to seem strong while feeling weak?  A nanny being sharp with my children -- a kind woman, simply burned out? Or a victim of abuse becoming the abuser?  ''I now wish to suggest to this witness that if she had had this information at the time, this could have influenced her perception of Miss Mulholland,'' her lawyer said. ''If you knew on the night what you know now, do you think that your take on what was happening would have been different?''  The testimony went on for weeks. Along the way, Noreen stopped speaking to me in the lobby in the morning. I assume this was because my growing belief that she was guilty was obvious from my body language and in the time I spent talking to the Dohertys and the Gethingses. Eventually I told the families everything. They had the questions I'd expected, and now I was ready to answer. Do you think she did this? Yes. Do you think she purposefully set out to hurt anyone? No.  I returned home before the verdict. I was sitting in the carpool line at Alex's middle school when I learned, in a cellphone call from Tom Gethings, that the jury convicted Noreen on both counts of assault and one count of ''poisoning'' (against Gethings).  In the weeks between that verdict and the sentencing hearing, I heard from Noreen one last time. She needed letters asking for leniency from the judge. Would I write one? I said I would and agonized over every word. I told the judge what I'd learned of her childhood and how I'd become convinced of her guilt. And I asked him for compassion, though not, I think, the kind that Noreen had in mind.  ''What Noreen needs,'' I wrote, ''is structured and intense help in absorbing and learning from her past, so she can begin to heal. She needs abuse-survivor counseling, to unravel the damage done to her by her father. She certainly needs anger-management training, to teach her to take a different path from the brutal road on which she was raised. But to send her to prison will merely add yet another victim to this awful tale.''  I sent the letter directly to Noreen, not to the court. Her lawyer never presented my words to the judge. ''After consulting with my legal representatives, the letter cannot be used,'' Noreen e-mailed me a few days before the sentencing hearing. ''I am more than your next story,'' she continued. ''I was the person who loved your boys, the person who cleaned your kitchen on a Saturday night so your mother-in-law wouldn't pass comment on her Sunday-morning arrival.  ''I am now at a stage of my life,'' she concluded, ''when I have had to question many things and many people. After reading your letter ... I have no choice but to ask you not to contact me in the future.''  I have not spoken to Noreen since, and she declined to speak to a fact checker for this article. I was not in the courtroom when O'Lideadha, asking for a reduced sentence, told the court that his client had ''flipped out and used excessive force'' on Gethings and Doherty, that she had never deliberately tried to hurt anyone and that she was deeply sorry for the pain caused to patients and families.  Her lawyer went on to describe the horror of her childhood. It was only then that I learned that even all that she told me that afternoon in Naas was far from everything. She was sexually assaulted by a neighbor at age 9, her lawyer said. She was hospitalized after a suicide attempt at 15.  Judge O'Donnell said he took all that into account when, on Dec. 18, he sentenced Noreen to four years for each assault charge and two years for the single poisoning charge -- and then suspended the sentence, giving her five years of probation instead. He acknowledged her harrowing childhood and said there would be ''little point'' in sending her to prison. The fact that she had surrendered her license, and would never work as a nurse again, he said, was punishment enough.  Reading all of this on the Web site of an Irish newspaper, I saw, with new and growing clarity, why Noreen had kept so much of her life a secret. Why there were some things she would not say out loud until she had no choice, until telling all was the only way to keep herself out of prison.  I had thought it was because of the shame of it. Now I think I understand something more. Just as I have been wondering whether you can trust someone you don't completely know, perhaps she wondered if the people in her life could care about someone who was not everything she seemed. Perhaps she was certain that my family cared about her only because of the image she showed us and that we would stop caring if she ever told us the whole truth. I like to think she was wrong. But I won't have a chance to ever know.  Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer for the magazine.  ",

            "text": "  The son of an Upper East Side landlord accused of killing his wife in 2005 by stabbing her more than 40 times testified on behalf of his father yesterday, telling the story of a marriage that unraveled into madness.  For most of his life, the son, Marcus Odierno, 25, told a jury, his was a fairly happy family. The Odiernos vacationed in Florida and the Caribbean and welcomed relatives and friends to their town house on East 84th Street for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  But in 1997, things changed, he said. His parents stopped inviting anyone over. His mother ordered one of his friends out of the house because she found his cologne too strong, Mr. Odierno said, and began browbeating her family.  ''My mother did not want anybody in the house anymore,'' he said in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  As the first defense witness, Mr. Odierno said that it was his father, Ben Odierno, 72, who was being abused, and his mother, Christine Odierno, 57, who was the abuser -- not the other way around, as the prosecution has argued.  In many ways, it was a portrait of an ordinary marriage, with fights over household chores. But the conflicts somehow veered into violence.  He said that in the fall of 1997, his mother kicked his father out of their bed, forcing him to sleep in a twin bed in the children's room. The bed had been vacated by Marcus's older brother, Stephan, then 18, who had moved to a nearby apartment when he went to college. While Ben Odierno shopped and cooked, Mrs. Odierno called him a slob and a lazy bum, their son said, and frequently taunted him, saying, ''Piggy, piggy, oink, oink.''  Marcus Odierno said his mother began acting as if she were being abused, even though she was not. He said she would slam into him, Stephan or their father and yell: ''Get your hands off me! Don't touch me! You're hurting me!'' Then, he said, she would open the glass doors to the solarium ''and scream these accusations out into the backyard,'' for the neighbors to hear.  In the last year of her life, he said, Mrs. Odierno would hold a knife to her own throat and ask her husband and sons, ''What are you going to do, are you going to slit my throat?''  Jack Litman, Ben Odierno's defense lawyer, asked, ''Do you remember what knife she used?''  ''Sure,'' Marcus Odierno said. ''She used a sharp salad knife.''  Mr. Litman contends that on April 24, 2005, Mrs. Odierno turned that knife against her husband, stabbing him. He has said that his client reacted by grabbing another knife and stabbing his wife in self-defense. Mrs. Odierno ended up dead, stabbed in the heart.  Prosecutors say that Ben Odierno killed his wife in a rage because she had given him separation papers, and then stabbed himself in the abdomen.  Marcus Odierno's former girlfriend Allegra Lugo also testified yesterday, saying she had seen Mrs. Odierno yell that she was being abused when she was not.  Marcus Odierno said that while he and his father slept, his mother would come into their room and wake them by rummaging through the closet or turning off the air-conditioning. In the mornings, he said, she would lock herself in the bathroom for hours, refusing to get out when he needed to get ready for school.  Marcus Odierno said that his mother, who had never cursed around him before, became more and more foul-mouthed in the last year of her life, and accused her husband of cheating on her.  In the months before his wife's death, Ben Odierno lost about 50 pounds, but remained ''docile'' despite his wife's abuse, their son said.  When the jury was out of the room, Mr. Litman and his fellow counsel, Todd Terry, told the judge, Justice Gregory Carro, that Marcus Odierno had begun to suspect that his father had Alzheimer's disease.  In another conference with the judge, the prosecutor, Kerry O'Connell, said Mrs. Odierno had begun shunning her husband and sons not because she was mentally ill, but because she loathed them.  Under cross-examination, Marcus Odierno said he had been kicked out of high school for bad grades, and conceded that he was living on money provided by his father.  ''Would it be fair to say that your days were spent doing whatever leisure activities you wanted to do?'' Ms. O'Connell asked him.  ''Pretty much,'' he said.  Was it true, Ms. O'Connell asked, that his mother managed the family's real estate business, keeping the books, paying the taxes and dealing with city agencies? It was, he said.  Ms. O'Connell asked whether his mother had also given him money.  ''My mother refused to give me money,'' he said.  Correction:  February 3, 2007, Saturday  An article last Saturday about the murder trial of Ben Odierno, a Manhattan landlord accused of killing his wife, Christine, referred incorrectly to her injuries and to a defense witness, Allegra Lugo. According to prosecutors, Mrs. Odierno had more than 40 injuries on her body, including scrapes, cuts, bruises and stab wounds; she was not stabbed more than 40 times. Ms. Lugo is a former girlfriend of the Odiernos' son Stephan -- not of his brother, Marcus. The article also misstated a point made by a prosecutor, Kerry O'Connell. She said that Mr. Odierno and his sons loathed Mrs. Odierno, not the other way around.  ",

            "text": "  CHRISTOPHER CASTRO had no worries about where his fianc\u00e9e was, even though she was more than an hour late for their wedding on Dec. 30. He calmly placated the guests and the minister fidgeting in the crowded chapel. He had been in tighter spots with his tardy bride, and this, after all, was just a late limousine.  Judith Hernandez and Mr. Castro are New York City police officers and, as onetime partners in the department's housing bureau, they made heroic rescues during the 9/11 attacks.  The searing memory of that day -- how they cheated death together, the lives they saved together, and those they could not save -- pulled them steadily closer afterward, as did the year of 16-hour days they spent together sifting through the ruins at ground zero. It finally persuaded them to end their police partnership and become partners in marriage.  As they stood exchanging vows and lighting candles, Ms. Hernandez, 42, and Mr. Castro, 33, said that they could not help but think about how they stood together five years ago watching the chaos around them.  On that day in 2001, Mr. Castro, Ms. Hernandez and another officer working with them, Steven Oemcke, were near City Hall in a patrol car when the first plane hit the north tower. All three entered that tower looking for injured people to evacuate from the sublevels of the building. When the south tower collapsed, it rocked the north tower and spewed smoke and debris into the concourse below.  ''Chris and I called out to each other and realized neither of us were hurt,'' Ms. Hernandez said.  When Ms. Hernandez recognized that Officer Oemcke was unaccounted for, she began searching in the dark. The collapse had thrown him down an escalator, where he was unconscious with severe back and shoulder injuries. She found him by feeling her way along until she came across Officer Oemcke's gun belt, said Ms. Hernandez, who is just over 5-foot-1 and weighs 110 pounds. When she yelled his name, he regained consciousness. ''I crawled under him and carried him on my shoulders two levels up the broken escalators,'' she said.  No easy task -- Officer Oemcke is six feet tall and weighs 190 pounds.  They soon reunited with Mr. Castro on an upper concourse, and he helped her carry the injured officer to the street and to safety just before the second building trembled and collapsed. For her efforts, Ms. Hernandez was awarded the Medal of Honor by the Police Department, its highest award for an officer.  ''As horrible as that day was, it brought us closer together,'' Ms. Hernandez said. ''The more we thought back on it, we realized we valued our relationship more than if we hadn't gone through it. So many people around us died, we wondered if God had a different plan for both of us.''  At that time, they had been partners on the force for six months. Ms. Hernandez was in a serious relationship and was known among her fellow officers for being chatty with the public and for being able to tolerate paperwork and tedious departmental duties and details.  Mr. Castro, at 6-foot-3, was strong and silent and married. A former marine, Mr. Castro was known as the poker-faced enforcer. Each had young children.  ''We formed a strong bond immediately,'' Ms. Hernandez said. ''We were like brother and sister, or best friends. We just did everything together.'' That included spending time with their kids and attending each other's family functions.  But the two kept it platonic.  ''Your partner is your lifeline, so we didn't want to ruin the partnership,'' Mr. Castro said. ''So starting a romantic relationship was not an option.''  By 2004, her boyfriend was gone and Mr. Castro's marriage had ended in divorce. He had been assigned as a youth officer, so they were no longer partners.  In the summer of 2004 Mr. Castro and Ms. Hernandez, who had never been married, had their first true date. They walked the streets and parks near the neighborhood that they once patrolled, and they wondered if they could be as good together as a couple as they were as partners.  Three months later they decided to spend a week together in Las Vegas without the children. The only real reminder of their everyday lives was the fake skyline on the New York New York Hotel.  ''We were just two people in a place where no one knew us, and we tried to get to know each other as civilians, without all the other stuff between us,'' she said. ''On the plane coming back, Chris turned to me, and in a way that wasn't by the book and professional, he told me he loved me. When we got back to New York we were ready to begin our life together.''  They decided to combine their households and lives. ''At this point we knew this was it,'' Ms. Hernandez said.  Her sons, Cesar Rosa, 13, and Christian Brian Ruiz, 18, had grown attached to Mr. Castro. So when their mother told them that she and Mr. Castro were going to marry, they cheered.  Cesar and Christian attended their wedding with Mr. Castro's children, Christopher Emil, 9; Kristian, 3; and Mariah, 4. They and the couples' extended families all watched as the Rev. Julio Mercado, an interfaith minister, officiated at Astoria World Manor in Queens.  Jacqueline Colon, 44, a recently retired police officer who had worked with the bride and bridegroom said that ''9/11 was definitely their awakening day.'' She was sitting at a table during the reception with a group of police officers, including Mr. Oemcke, who has also retired.  Mr. Oemcke looked out toward Ms. Hernandez, who was dancing the salsa with her father, and Mr. Castro, who was dancing with his children. ''I wouldn't be alive if not for them,'' he said.  The bride was in a reflective mood in the days before the wedding and spoke about how during their patrols together she and Mr. Castro would find themselves discussing what it was each wanted in a relationship. Both had expressed a desire, she said, for ''someone family oriented and professional and who sees things through, and is a good parent.''  ''We finally realized we were describing each other,'' she said.  WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS: VOWS  ",

            "text": "  If the cost of this war is measured in human lives, one block in southeast Baghdad has paid more than its share.  On a hot morning two summers ago, 34 children were killed here in a flash of smoke and metal. They were scooping up candy thrown from an American Humvee. The suicide bomber's truck never slowed down.  More than 3,000 Iraqis are dying every month in this war -- roughly the total deaths in the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon or all the American troops killed since the war began. But behind the headlines and statistics, most of the war is experienced in Iraqi living rooms and on blocks like the one here, where families struggle with the intense pain of loss.  And while American war planners discuss the way ahead, Iraqis on this scarred block are stuck in the past on the morning of July 13, 2005, when time stopped and the war truly began for them.  ''Our life now, it's not a life, it's a kind of dream,'' said Qais Ataiwee Yaseen, whose two boys, ages 8 and 11, were killed that day. ''Life has no taste. I even feel sick of myself.''  In the early years of the war, the street -- a dusty, trash-strewn strip of concrete that runs between Baghdad's southeast highway and the neighborhood of Naariya -- was mostly quiet, home to a mix of Shiite and Sunni families who had known one another for years.  But the cruelty of the war intervened when the bomber struck, apparently aiming at a convoy of American Humvees parked at the end of the street. One American soldier and 34 Iraqis were killed. All of the Iraqis were boys, and all but four were younger than 15. The youngest was 6. In all, 29 families lost children; one lost three sons.  In the seconds after the explosion, the world narrowed to one child for Sattar Hashim, a 39-year-old security guard whose son had gone out to see the American patrol. Mr. Hashim moved frantically through the wreckage, just outside his front gate, a scene now burned into his memory. He found his son unconscious, his body torn by shrapnel.  ''I pray to God that no one in this world will ever have to face such a scene,'' he said as he sat in his sparely furnished living room with the curtains drawn. ''As if they had been scattered on the ground. Legs. Arms. Heads. Bodies still burning.''  His son died in a hospital operating room several hours after the explosion.  Suicide bombings often stop clocks nearby, throwing the delicate mechanisms out of balance. The minute hand freezes the moment that the bomber detonates, and cleanup crews find clocks hanging crookedly on walls hours later, with the moment of loss fixed forever on the clocks' faces.  For the parents in Naariya, the clocks are frozen at a quarter after 10. The deaths that morning tore a hole in the life of the block, and more than a year later, many people have been unable to put their lives back together. Some have drifted away from their spouses. Others changed jobs or stopped going to work altogether. Reminders of the loss were everywhere: Class sizes were smaller. Soccer tournaments for 12-year-olds stopped. Bug collecting was no longer a hobby.  The pain caused strange things to happen. Mr. Yaseen lost his knack for numbers and found himself fumbling in front of customers at the hardware store where he had worked for years. Eventually, he quit. Reading and writing became difficult for Zahra Hussein, the mother of 11-year-old Hamza. She had lost her ability to concentrate and some of her eyesight.  Hadi Faris, Hamza's father, stopped his work as a driver. He could not control his thoughts, and concentrating on the road and split- second decisions was too onerous.  ''I kept thinking how life is cheap, how so many innocent people are killed,'' he said, sitting in front of a kerosene heater in a small guest room.  After some months, he applied for, and was given, a job as a guard in his son's school. It felt somehow reassuring to do after his son's death what could not be done during his life: protect.  ''I felt that all the kids were Hamza,'' he said. ''My main job was to protect them all.''  Life became empty and quiet for the children who were left. Adel Ali, 12, lost four of his best friends, most of his small soccer team and his entire bicycle-racing brigade. They had all shared a surge of happiness in the form of a birthday cake with candles, a first for most of the children, just days before the explosion. The experience was recorded in a grainy photograph of nine little boys making monkey faces. All but two are dead.  Adel spends his afternoons alone at home. In the early evening, he plays soccer with the older boys. They do not know the names of famous players that he and his friends gave each other when they made good plays. They do not know the sheer joy of riding bicycles while holding a rope together. They do not understand his loneliness.  ''We used to play together, and the adults would play in another place,'' said Adel, his small fingers zipping and unzipping a fleece pullover at his neck.  The attack seemed calculated to make Iraqis despise Americans, in a pattern that would eventually succeed and change the direction of the war. But while some of the parents interviewed seem to have developed that hatred, many had not and even expressed respect. Mr. Faris said that immediately after the bombing he saw a soldier with a mangled arm trying to pick up a wounded child.  More Americans came to the area several weeks later and brought small trinkets to houses, in what Iraqis assumed was something of a peace offering.  ''We never hurt the Americans, and the Americans never hurt us,'' Mr. Faris said.  A constant theme of the war for Iraqis has been their complete lack of control over chaotic, life-changing events. Like victims of a car wreck on an empty highway, they sit in pain and hope that help will come along.  Mr. Yaseen is haunted by the helplessness he felt that morning when he found his younger son, Ali, still alive. He was badly burned and missing his feet.  ''I said to myself -- two feet, it is nothing,'' he said. But within several hours the child was dead.  ''I did not have the ability to do anything for him,'' Mr. Yaseen said. ''To save him.''  Memories rush back at inconvenient moments. Mr. Yaseen has one in which his older son, Abbas, who loved bugs, begged him not to put poison down for the ants, saying, ''They also have families and houses.''  Even trifles sting. Ali, called English Ali for his tidiness and admiration for Americans, had only bread to eat for breakfast that morning.  ''I'm like a dead man,'' said Mr. Yaseen, crying into his hands. ''I have no ambitions. I have no goals in life. I have lost everything.''  His wife and daughter have moved out, and he has retreated into his apartment, a 12-foot by 14-foot room. He stopped shaving. The room is now piled with baskets of laundry, old children's toys and a metal bassinet.  ''I live in this room,'' he said. ''I sleep in this room. I eat in this room. This is my whole life. As if I'm in prison.''  Meanwhile, the war ground on, and the block was not immune to changes.  In February, poor Shiites rampaged in neighborhoods throughout eastern Baghdad. Naariya started to lose Sunnis. New graffiti in black paint across from Mr. Yaseen's house spelled praise for a Shiite cleric.  Three Shiite families from Diyala, a violent province north of Baghdad, arrived with the stunned look of refugees who just lost everything but their lives.  ''There are no smiles on their faces,'' Ms. Hussein said. ''You can tell they lost somebody.''  Attacks on Shiites by Sunni militants started to wear, and families on the block began asking about the backgrounds of newcomers.  A small statue erected in the children's memory was blown up, and a bomb was planted under a date palm tree nearby, but it did not explode. During the Ramadan holiday in October, around 20 Sunni men disappeared from the neighborhood. Their bodies turned up in different neighborhoods several days later.  Mr. Hashim heard of the kidnappings but was afraid to ask about them.  ''We woke up one day,'' he said, ''and a family had left.'' The 2005 explosion gouged the pavement in front of his house, and afterward he had a large blast wall built. The wall had the added benefit of shielding him from seeing the crater in the street day after day.  For Adel, the 12-year-old whose friends were killed, memories returned in spurts. Some time after the July attack, he took his bicycle to the balcony of his house and threw it off. He was angry about what happened, Ms. Hussein said. A month ago, his life became even more isolated: a guard and a teacher from his school were killed, and Adel's father began keeping him home.  The boys come back in unexpected ways. Hamza's sister sees her brother's face in a boy who lives in a house on her way to school. She gives him candy sometimes. Mr. Yaseen often sees his boys in dreams.  In one, Abbas asks him why he is crying. He spoke of his own burial in a reassuring way. ''He tried to make it easy for me,'' Mr. Yaseen said.  Speaking of the deaths, Mr. Hashim said: ''It formed a hole, a big hole. Before the street was crowded. Cars had to go slowly. Now it's empty.''  THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ  ",

            "text": "  IN the summer of 2005, Diana Biederman, a publicist with long black locks and an air of girlish candor, was nearing the end of a seven-month stretch of chemotherapy after surgery for colon cancer. Because of the side effects, she had to stay within sprinting distance of a bathroom at all times, which effectively left her a single place to relax: a bench on the mall of Broadway at 80th Street, across the street from her gym and a block from her apartment.  ''That became my beach,'' recalled Ms. Biederman, 41. She read and napped there on weekend mornings, soaking up the sun and getting to know the peculiarities of the bench, a battered gray affair dating to the late 1980s that, she later recalled, was missing crucial slats from the bottom and the back. ''The bench was a little frayed,'' she said. ''It was sort of gray and sad and worn out.''  Fall came, and with it weeks of unrelenting rain. On the first sunny day of October, Ms. Biederman ventured out again to the bench, where she fell into conversation with a stranger, a lantern-jawed 37-year-old named Douglas Rosefsky. They got to talking about their favorite benches.  ''I told him, 'Long story short, I'm thinking about adopting the bench,' '' she recalled. ''He's like, 'I'll go halfsies with you.' I said, 'Are you kidding?' ''  Mr. Rosefsky, a specialist in corporate turnarounds, introduced himself by name. ''You'll always be Benchboy to me,'' Ms. Biederman told him.  About seven months later, the Broadway Mall Association, the median's nonprofit caretaker, installed a pair of new benches to replace the old one, using $2,500 donated by Ms. Biederman and Mr. Rosefsky. The new benches have elegant, looping, semicircular armrests, and a plaque on one of them reads, ''Diana and Doug's Sunny Warm Happy Bench.''  Mr. Rosefsky and Ms. Biederman celebrated by having a pizza delivered to the spot, which they had granted a fictional street address, 227 West 80th Street. And on Oct. 20, the two held a ''bench-warming party'' for 60 people at Ms. Biederman's apartment, followed by a march to the site of the benches.  The median maintained by the mall association extends for about five miles, from 70th to 168th Streets, and has about 250 benches. Ms. Biederman and Mr. Rosefsky's benches are the first to have been sponsored by donors, though the practice is common in other parks, including Central and Prospect Parks.  Both adoptive parents confess to proprietary feelings about the benches.  ''Every time I cross the street, I'm looking to check that there's no litter,'' Ms. Biederman said. And she and Mr. Rosefsky have jokingly invented a set of bench rules. Chief among them, Ms. Biederman said: ''Should this bench be too crowded, you have to make room for us.''

            "text": "  DEAR DIARY:  Our Manhattan-born-and-bred eighth grader thinks she might enjoy a high school with a campus atmosphere. So a few weeks ago, my husband and I found ourselves sitting in the parents' lounge of a Bronx high school while our daughter was being interviewed.  We wanted to see the students in action, so we left the lounge for a lovely old carved bench in the main corridor, a perfect perch from which to watch teenage energy in motion.  While we were taking in the scene, a young lady, unable to contain her curiosity, approached us and whispered, ''So what did you guys do to deserve detention?''  Susie Case  Dear Diary:  What with all the construction going on at the Juilliard School these days, there are, of course, a lot of signs in the hallways about the work. One of the more interesting ones I've spotted, posted on the door of a newly constructed office, reads: ''Future temporary home of chamber music chairman.''  Richard Lewis  Dear Diary:  Walking on 10th Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets, my daughters, Robin and June, brought our attention to what we thought was the squeaking of brakes but turned out to be the whinnying of a horse pulling a carriage. Two drivers were holding the reins and the horse was rearing its head, going up on its hind legs and repeating its whinnying over and over.  My son, Glenn, and I were behind my husband, Rich, and my daughters, and we were paying close attention to this little drama when one driver jumped out of his seat and, landing on the ground, turned to the horse and said: ''O.K., O.K. I'll buy you an apple.''  As he said it, he ran toward a small corner store that actually had a large row of big red apples in the window.  The horse got his apple and was quiet as a mouse.  Shirlene Cohen  Dear Diary:  Two stories:  1. I'm walking my dog in our West Side neighborhood when I peer into the lobby of a neighboring building and see a handwritten sign tacked up on the wall. The sign reads: ''Whoever is stealing my Wall Street Journal, would you please stop? If you can't afford the 75 cents, maybe it's not working out for you anyway.''  2. My wife and I are touring the ''Bodies'' exhibition at South Street Seaport, looking at the nervous system. Two elderly women are in front of us, and one says to the other ''Yeah, my Aunt Betty had problems with the nerves in her arms. Terrible pain up and down the arm. It was diagnosed as nostalgia.''  Erik Kolbell  Dear Diary:  My husband, John, and I had taken our three children -- Myles, 7; Amanda, 4; and Tommy, 1 -- to the Tisch Children's Zoo at the Central Park Wildlife Center. We were happily giving feed pellets to the goats when I noticed a little boy (equally happily) shoveling the pellets into his own mouth.  Before I could warn him that he would make himself sick, his mother grabbed his hand out of his mouth, and upbraided him with the following words: ''Don't eat those, silly; they're not kosher.''  Julie Kornfeld  Dear Diary:  I noticed a homeless woman in her mid-40s looking at the fruit and vegetables at a corner stand in the mid-50s in Manhattan. Finally, I walked over to her and asked if she would like to choose something from the assortment.  She answered: ''Oh, yes. I would love a bunch of those green grapes.''  ''Great,'' I responded. The fruit vendor picked out a bunch of green grapes, put them in the bag and handed them to her. She looked in the bag and then looked at me.  ''You know,'' she said, ''this is a lot of grapes. Won't you share them with me?''  There I stood in the middle of Manhattan eating the best grapes ever with this delightful, generous woman.  June Aaronson  Dear Diary:  One day in the fall my grandson, Tom, was riding west on a highway in New Jersey to visit his uncle, who lived partway up a mountain. Suffering from the boredom inherent to all 4-year-olds in transit, he asked his father how many more blocks to Uncle Tim's.  His dad explained that in the city it was blocks, but that in the country, it was miles, and since miles were longer than blocks, it would take a while.  Tom pondered this information and then asked, ''But what floor does he live on?''  Jenny Dwyer  Metropolitan Diary  ",

            "text": "  Wearing a black velvet coat and a patterned blouse, the 86-year-old mother of the dead woman looked birdlike and frail as she walked to the witness stand.  She remembered the last time she spoke to her daughter, Christine Odierno, by telephone.  ''Mom, I gave Ben the divorce papers, and he went bananas,'' the mother, Jennie Kramer, told the jury in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday, quoting her daughter. ''He's going to kill me, Mom. He's going to kill me. He's going to kill me.''  With that, Mrs. Kramer leaned forward, her head collapsing into her hands, and cried.  It was the most emotional moment in the first day of the murder trial of Benjamin Odierno, accused of stabbing his wife, Christine, to death on April 24, 2005, in the kitchen of their Upper East Side town house, where she was cutting lettuce for dinner.  Prosecutors say Mr. Odierno, 72, killed his wife, who was 57, three days after she gave him divorce papers -- purposely handing them over in a public place, they say, because she was afraid of him. They say she was a long-suffering victim of domestic abuse that always stayed hidden within the thick walls of their home on East 84th Street.  When the police arrived, said the prosecutor, Kerry O'Connell, ''she was able to draw enough breath to say, 'My husband did this. My husband stabbed me in the heart.' ''  The defense lawyer, Jack Litman, agreed that Mr. Odierno killed his wife. But he said that it was in self-defense, and that it was she who had been tormenting him, forcing him to see a psychiatrist.  ''He never raised a hand to her,'' Mr. Litman said. ''He acted and reacted instinctively to save his own life after she stabbed him.''  He said Mr. Odierno, a landlord, had traumatic amnesia that prevented him from recalling the details of the night his wife died. The police, responding to a 911 call reporting a woman's screams, said that when they arrived they found Mr. Odierno stabbing himself in the abdomen.  But what emerged most clearly from the first day of the trial was a portrait of a family deeply divided, in which some members take Mrs. Odierno's side, and others, including the couple's two grown sons, take her husband's.  Mr. Litman told jurors that the sons would testify on behalf of their father. They would describe, he said, how their mother had grown increasingly unstable over the last eight or so years of her life. She became very thin, and ate only lettuce for dinner, obsessively separating the white parts from the green parts, Mr. Litman said in his opening statement.  He said that Mrs. Odierno had exiled her husband from the couple's bedroom, forcing him to sleep in a single bed in a room he shared with Marcus, the younger son. She hoarded hundreds of rolls of toilet paper in the basement, Mr. Litman said, and screamed that her husband was abusing her loud enough for the neighbors to hear, yet nobody ever reported seeing any bruises.  Mr. Litman hammered on the family divisions during cross-examination of Mrs. Odierno's mother.  ''You have a son, right?'' he asked Mrs. Kramer, who had testified that she was the mother of three daughters, including Christine, and a 61-year-old son, Bill.  ''Not anymore,'' she replied.  ''Now of course, Bill is still alive, isn't he?''  ''I think so,'' Mrs. Kramer replied.  ''The reason you're saying you don't know is because Bill supports Benjamin Odierno, is that right?'' Mr. Litman asked.  ''I have no idea what you mean,'' Mrs. Kramer said.  ''Did you see your son at the funeral?'' Mr. Litman asked.  ''Yes,'' Mrs. Kramer said.  ''Did you see him as a pallbearer?''  ''I think he was,'' Mrs. Kramer said. ''I'm not certain.''  Mr. Litman had no further questions.  ",

A tall, imposing security guard took the driver's license from my hand and studied it for what seemed an unusually long time.  He gazed several times at my 70-plus face, then back at the photo taken a few years before as though trying hard to discern whether I could really be the person depicted. My anxiety was mounting as he handed back my license and smiled, saying, ''I think your old haircut was better.''

Richard Valeriani  Dear Diary:  During my recent visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I went to the desk to ask for a headset for their audio guide. The Met supplies these free to patrons who use hearing aids.  I said to the attendant , ''One pair of earphones, please; I'm hard of hearing.'' She gave me the earphones, and I turned to leave.  ''That will be six dollars,'' she said.  ''But, Miss,'' I said, ''I'm hard of hearing.''  ''I'm so sorry,'' she said, and shouted, ''THAT WILL BE SIX DOLLARS, PLEASE!''  Sue Ann Kogan  Dear Diary:  I was reading on a Brooklyn-bound subway when a group of fourth or fifth graders entered the car, accompanied by their teacher and some other adults. The children were obviously on their way back to school after completing a field trip. A gaggle of girls immediately commandeered a row of seats and bent their heads together conspiratorially.  When the teacher noticed this, she singled out one girl in the middle of the pack -- apparently a ringleader. ''Melissa,'' the teacher said sternly, ''haven't we talked about gossiping? Are you girls gossiping?''  ''We're not gossiping,'' Melissa shot back. ''We're theorizing.''  The teacher had no answer.

Alice Henry Whitmore  Dear Diary:  I was on a southbound bus on Fifth Avenue recently when a well-dressed woman on the shady side of middle age boarded. She spotted a friendly face across the aisle and cried out -- with dignity -- ''How are you?''  The second woman looked equally pleased and they sat together and spoke of their surprise at not bumping into each other for so long and how well they each looked, and then plotted lunch at Barney's.  First Woman: ''You know, you look so different. By the way, how's Mel?''  Second Woman: (Pause) ''Who's Mel?''  First Woman: (Another pause) ''Aren't you Ruth?''  Second Woman: ''My name is Sandy.''

            "text": "  The body of an infant girl was discovered yesterday afternoon at the bottom of a trash chute in a Bronx apartment building, the police said.  The baby, described by investigators as Hispanic and less than 4 months old, was declared dead at the scene. It was unclear when or how she had died.  Last night, investigators searched the 19-story apartment building, at 225 Willis Avenue in Mott Haven, with a German shepherd to determined where the baby may have been in the complex.  The baby was found shortly before 4 p.m., when a maintenance worker who was in the trash compactor room heard a loud thud, an investigator said. It did not sound like trash falling, so he looked inside the bin.  One resident, Geraldine Pinckney, 46, who had heard the maintenance man describe how he had discovered the baby, said: ''He went to see what was in there, and when he opened it, he thought it was a doll baby until he saw the blue lips, and then he knew.''  Maintenance workers said that the baby's body was intact and that she appeared to have been dead before being thrown down the chute. Investigators said she was wearing a pink hooded coat and a white jumper.  Other residents said they did not know of any babies recently born to tenants in the building.  ''I know everyone in this building after 14 years,'' said Doris Soto, 43. ''I can't believe this happened. I'm trying to remember who I know and who I've seen that has small babies.''  Tenants, who were kept waiting outside the building during the investigation last night, were shaken by the discovery. Isabelle Johnson, 63, president of the tenants association, said: ''This is chaotic. It doesn't make any sense. There are so many outs that you have. You can run away. You can bang on someone's door. Anything.''  ",

            "text": "  ON a hot summer afternoon in an affluent Boston suburb, the town swimming pool is swarming with watchful mothers and their noisy young children at play. The pool is where Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet), the mother of a little girl, Lucy (Sadie Goldstein), and Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), a stay-at-home father, whose son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), is Lucy's age, have chosen to carry on a discreet flirtation under the guise of neighborly parenting in Todd Field's ''Little Children.''  Both Sarah and Brad are married. Brad is so movie-star handsome that the young mothers who admire him from a distance at the playground have nicknamed him the Prom King. Sarah, the only one in the group to have introduced herself to him, did so on a dare. Now they are friends, struggling to conceal their intensifying mutual desire.  On this particular muggy afternoon both are wrung out by the sweltering heat.  ''Hot enough for you?'' Sarah mumbles, sprawled on the grass in her new red bathing suit with a piece of clothing tossed over her eyes against the sun.  ''Yeah, it's so humid,'' he replies. ''I got football practice tonight. Be like playing in a sauna.''  ''Watch out for that Italian guy, what's his name? Corrente?'' she asks.  ''Yeah.''  ''Remember what happened to your knee last week,'' she cautions. ''You should be careful, Brad.''  ''I'll be careful.''  ''Honest?''  ''Yeah I promise. '' Squinting, he looks toward the sky. ''Weatherman said scattered showers. I don't see scattered showers.''  The camera notices a group of women playing cards and another woman reading Vanity Fair.  Two brats pester their mother for food, and are rebuffed. ''No, sweetheart, you guys just had snacks. No.'' Exasperated, she turns to a neighbor. ''All they want is sugar. Constantly.''  Suddenly a man in his late 40s, with a cadaverous face, thinning hair and dead white skin, appears, padding purposefully toward the pool in black flippers, carrying a snorkel. It is the movie's first appearance of Ronnie J. McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), the town pariah, whose face was glimpsed earlier in the film on posters distributed by a group of townspeople calling itself the Committee of Concerned Parents. Ronnie, we have already learned, was recently released from prison after serving two years for exposing himself to a minor, and has moved back to town.  Unnoticed at first, he puts on the equipment and plunks into the water with a loud splash, as the camera follows him into the pool below the water line, where the sounds from above are muffled. After he takes a second dunk, Sarah notices him and frowns.  ''Oh, no,'' she says pulling herself up and sighing. ''It's him.''  ''Oh, Jesus,'' Brad mutters.  Two other mothers catch sight of Ronnie.  ''Oh, my God, it's him! He's in the pool.''  The word of Ronnie's presence spreads like electricity.  ''Why is everyone running to the pool?'' one woman wonders aloud, as frantic mothers start calling out the names of their children and shouting, ''You'd better get over here!''  Sarah and Brad, standing and holding their newly retrieved children, observe the spreading alarm that the children have begun to sense, and several begin to cry.  As they scramble out of the pool, scooped up by their parents, Ronnie bobs back under the water. Within two minutes the crowded pool has emptied, and the raucousness subsides. The mothers, their faces knotted in hostility, now ring the pool, clutching their children and glaring silently at Ronnie, who descends underwater one more time and propels himself across the pool.  From a distance two policemen advance. Lucy, turning to Sarah, asks in a plaintive voice, ''Why the police is here?''  Her mother replies, ''There's a man over there that doesn't have a ticket to get in, so they're asking him to go home.''  One of the policemen calls out: ''Mr. McGorvey! Mr. McGorvey! Would you mind getting out of the pool at this time?''  Still in the water and wearing goggles, looking like a monster that has fallen from outer space onto the wrong planet, Ronnie, expressionless, blinks behind his mask, then slowly swims to the side.  ''Step out of the pool, sir,'' one officer demands.  He emerges from the water and removes his flippers and goggles. Then a policeman takes him gently by the arm and begins to shepherd him away. Just as Ronnie appears to be meekly acquiescing, he turns back toward the accusing crowd and shouts, ''I was only trying to cool off!''  ''All right, let's go, come on,'' the officer says firmly.  After a split second of silence, the children erupt in tumultuous chatter. Higher pitched than before, it is a collective exhalation of relief, as the children, released by their mothers, tumble pell-mell back into the water.  The sky is darkening, and there is a rumble of thunder.  This disturbing, acutely observed scene bares the state of anxiety that seethes just below the idyllic surface of upscale suburban America. The wave of panic sweeping over the parents reveals a pervasive fortress mentality. The communal loathing of this pathetic middle-aged flasher borders perilously close to mob fury. To the assembled parents the fishlike Ronnie is nothing less than a ravenous carp let loose in a goldfish bowl. For these grown-up ''little children,'' he is the bogeyman incarnate.  The scene's brilliance lies in the microscopically perfect eye for detail shared by Mr. Field and his collaborator on the screenplay, Tom Perrotta, who wrote the novel from which ''Little Children'' was adapted. In a ferociously complex ensemble scene involving several dozen actors, not an inflection or beat rings false.  THE OSCARS  ",

            "text": "  Kingdom of Arran, in the Caucasus Mountains, between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, A.D. 950 -- For numberless years a myna had astounded travelers to the caravansary with its ability to spew indecencies in 10 languages, and before the fight broke out everyone assumed the old blue-tongued devil on its perch by the fireplace was the one who maligned the giant African with such foulness and verve. Engrossed in the study of a small ivory shatranj board with pieces of ebony and horn, and in the stew of chickpeas, carrots, dried lemons and mutton for which the caravansary was renowned, the African held the place nearest the fire, his broad back to the bird, with a view of the doors and the window with its shutters thrown open to the blue dusk. On this temperate autumn evening in the kingdom of Arran in the eastern foothills of the Caucasus, it was only the two natives of burning jungles, the African and the myna, who sought to warm their bones. The precise origin of the African remained a mystery. In his quilted gray bambakion with its frayed hood, worn over a ragged white tunic, there was a hint of former service in the armies of Byzantium, while the brass eyelets on the straps of his buskins suggested a sojourn in the West. No one had hazarded to discover whether the speech of the known empires, khanates, emirates, hordes and kingdoms was intelligible to him. With his skin that was lustrous as the tarnish on a copper kettle, and his eyes womanly as a camel's, and his shining pate with its ruff of wool whose silver hue implied a seniority attained only by the most hardened men, and above all with the air of stillness that trumpeted his murderous nature to all but the greenest travelers on this minor spur of the Silk Road, the African appeared neither to invite nor to promise to tolerate questions. Among the travelers at the caravansary there was a moment of admiration, therefore, for the bird's temerity when it seemed to declare, in its excellent Greek, that the African consumed his food in just the carrion-scarfing way one might expect of the bastard offspring of a bald-pated vulture and a Barbary ape.  For a moment after the insult was hurled, the African went on eating, without looking up from the shatranj board, indeed without seeming to have heard the remark at all. Then, before anyone quite understood that a calumny so apposite went beyond the powers even of the myna and that the bird was innocent, this once, of slander, the African reached his left hand into his right buskin and, in a continuous gesture as fluid and unbroken as that by which a falconer looses his fatal darling into the sky, produced a shard of bright Arab steel, its crude hilt swaddled in strips of hide, and sent it hunting across the benches.  Neither the beardless stripling who was sitting just to the right of its victim, nor the one-eyed mahout who was the stripling's companion, would ever forget the dagger's keening as it stung the air. With the sound of a letter being sliced open by an impatient hand, it tore through the crown of the wide-brimmed black hat worn by the victim, a fair-haired scarecrow from some fogbound land who had ridden in, that afternoon, on the Tiflis road. He was a slight, thin-shanked fellow, gloomy of countenance, white as tallow, his hair falling in two golden curtains on either side of his long face. There was a rattling twang like that of an arrow striking a tree. The hat flew off the scarecrow's head as if registering his surprise and stuck to a post of the daub wall behind him as he let loose an outlandish syllable in the rheumy jargon of his homeland.  In the fireplace a glowing castle of embers subsided to ash. The mahout heard the iron ticking of a kettle on the boil in the kitchen. The benches squeaked, and travelers spat in anticipation.  The Frankish scarecrow slipped out from under his impaled hat and unfolded himself one limb at a time, running his fingers along the parting in his yellow hair. He looked from the African to the hat and back. His cloak, trousers, hose and boots were all black, in sharp contrast with the pallor of his soft hands and the glints of golden whisker on his chin and cheeks, and if he was not a priest, then he must, thought the mahout, for whom a knowledge of men was a necessary corollary to an understanding of elephants, be a physician or an exegete of moldering texts. The Frank folded his arms over his bony chest and stood taking the African's measure along the rule of his bony nose. He wore an arch smile and held his head at an angle meant to signify a weary half-amusement like that which plagued a philosophical man when he contemplated this vain human show. But it was apparent to the old mahout even with his one eye that the scarecrow was furious over the injury to his hat. His funereal clothes were of rich stuff, free of travel stains, suggesting that he maintained their appearance, and his own, with fierce determination.  The Frank reached two long fingers and a thumb into the wound in his hat, grimaced and with difficulty jerked out the dagger from the post. He turned the freed hat in his hands, suppressing the urge to stroke it, it seemed to the mahout, the way he himself would stroke the stubbled croup of a beloved dam as she expired. With an air of incalculable gravity, as if confiding the image of a household god, the Frank passed the hat to the stripling and carried the dagger across the room to the African, who had long since returned to his bowl of stew.  ''I believe, sir,'' the Frank informed the African, speaking again in the Greek of the East Romans, ''that you have mislaid the implement required for the cleaning of your hooves.'' The Frank jabbed the point of the dagger down into the table beside the shatranj board, jostling the pieces. ''If I am mistaken as to the actual nature of your lower extremities, I beg you to join me in the courtyard of this house, at your leisure but preferably soon, so that, with the pedagogical instrument of your choice, you may educate me.''  The Frank waited. The one-eyed mahout and the stripling, wondering, waited. By the door to the inn yard, where the ostler leaned, whispered odds were laid and taken, and the mahout heard the clink of coins and the squeak of a chalk wielded by the ostler, a Svan who disdained the distinction between turning a profit from seeing to the comfort of his guests and that of turning one from watching them die.  ''I'm sorry to report,'' the African said, rising to his feet, his head brushing the beams of the sloping roof, speaking in the lilting, bastardized Greek used among the mercenary legions of the emperor at Constantinople, ''that my hearing shares in the general decay of the broken-down old wreck you see before you.''  The African yanked the shard of Arab steel from the table and with it went in search of the Frank's voice box, ending their quest no farther from the pale knuckle of the Frank's throat than the width of the blade itself. The Frank fell back, bumping into a pair of Armenian wool factors at whom he glared as if it were some clumsiness of theirs and not his cowardly instinct for self-preservation that had cost him his footing.  ''But I take your gist,'' the African said, returning the dagger to his boot. On the ostler's slate the odds began to run heavily against the Frank.  The African restored the shatranj board and pieces to a leather pouch, wiped his lips and then pushed past the Frank, past the craning heads along the benches and went out into the inn yard to kill or be killed by his insulter. As the men trooped after him into the torch-lit courtyard, carrying cups of wine, wiping their bearded chins on their forearms, the weapons belonging to the combatants were fetched from a rack in the stable.  If because of his immensity, the span of his arms and his homicidal air, and despite his protestations of senescence, which were universally regarded as gamesmanship, the betting had been inclined to favor the African before the weapons were fetched, the arming of the two men decided it. The Frank carried only a long, absurdly thin bodkin that might serve, in a pinch, to roast a couple of birds over an open fire, if they were not too plump. The travelers had a good laugh at ''the tailor with his needle'' and then pondered the mystery of the African's choice of side arm, a huge Viking ax, its haft an orgy of interpenetrating runes, the quarter-moon of its blade glowing cold, as with satisfied recollection of all the heads it had ever lopped from spouting necks.  Under the full moon of the month of Mehr, with the torches hissing, the African and the Frank circled an ambit of packed earth. The Frank minced and scissored on his walking-stick legs, the tip of his bodkin indicating the heart of the African, glancing from time to time at his own fine black boots as they threaded a course through the archipelago of camel and horse droppings. The African employed an odd crabwise scuttling style of circling, knees bent, eyes fixed on the Frank, the ax held loosely in his left fist. The awkward, almost fond way they went about readying themselves to murder each other moved the old mahout, who had trained a thousand war elephants to kill and so recognized the professional quality of the interest these two combatants were taking in the fight. But the other travelers jostling under the eaves and archways of the inn yard, who knew nothing of the intimacy of slaughter, grew impatient. They jeered the combatants, urging them to hurry so they could all finish their suppers and file off to bed. Half-maddened by boredom, they doubled their wagers. Word of the duel had reached the village down the hill, and the gate of the inn yard was lively with women, children and sad-faced lean men with heroic moustaches. Boys climbed to the roof of the inn, shook their fists and hooted as the Frank and the African emptied their heads of last regrets.  Then the ax, humming, seemed to drag the African toward the belly of the Frank. Its blade caught the torchlight and scrawled an arcing rune of fire in the gloom. The Frankish scarecrow dodged, and watched, and ducked when the ax came looking for his head. He dropped to his shoulder, rolled on the ground, surprisingly adroit for a scatter-limbed scarecrow, and popped up behind the African, kicking him in the buttocks with a look on his face of such childish solemnity that the spectators again burst into laughter.  It was a contest of stamina against agility, and those who had their money on the former began with confidence in the favorite and his big Varangian ax, but the African, angered, grew gross and undiscerning in his ax-play. He shattered a huge clay jar full of rainwater, soaking a dozen outraged travelers. He splintered the wheel spokes of a hay wagon, and as the solemn Frank danced, rolled and thrust with his slender bodkin, the berserker ax bit flagstones, shedding handfuls of sparks.  The torches guttered, and the tinge of blood drained from the moon as it rose into the night sky. A boy watching the fracas from the roof leaned too far out, tumbled and broke his arm. Wine was fetched, mixed with clean water from the well and handed in bowls to the duelists, who staggered and reeled around the inn yard now, bleeding from a dozen cuts.  Then tossing aside the wine bowls, they faced each other. The watchful mahout caught a flicker in the giant African's eyes that was not torchlight. Once more the ax dragged the African like a charger trailing a dead cavalryman by the heel. The Frank tottered backward, and then as the African heaved past he drove the square toe of his left boot into the African's groin. All the men in the inn yard squirmed in half-willing sympathy as the African collapsed in silence onto his stomach. The Frank slid his preposterous sword into the African's side and yanked it out again. After thrashing for a few instants, the African lay still, as his dark -- though not, someone determined, black -- blood muddied the ground.  The ostler signaled to a pair of grooms, and with difficulty they dragged the dead giant out to a disused stable beyond the present walls of the caravansary and threw an old camel skin over him.  The Frank straightened his cuffs and hose and re-entered the caravansary, declining to accept the congratulations or good-natured japery of the losing bettors. He declined to take a drink too, and indeed melancholy seemed to overcome him in the wake of the fight, or perhaps his natural inclinations toward Northern gloom merely resumed their reign over his heart and face. He chewed his stew and took his leave. He wandered down to the stream behind the caravansary to wash his hands and face, then slipped into the derelict stable, taking his ruined hat from his head as if in tribute to the bravery of his opponent.  ''How much?'' he said as he entered the stable.  ''Seventy,'' the giant African replied, stringing the laces of his felt bambakion, its counterfeit bloodstains washed away in a horse trough, to the horn of his saddle. He rode a red-spotted Parthian, tall and thick-muscled, whose name was Porphyrogene. ''Enough for a dozen fine new black hats for you when we get to Rhages.''  ''Don't even say the word 'hat,' I beg you,'' the Frank said, gazing down at the hole in the high crown. ''It saddens me.''  ''Admit it was a fine throw.''  ''Not half so fine as this hat,'' the Frank said. He laid the hat aside and opened his shirt, revealing a bright laceration that ran, beaded with waxy drips of blood, across his abdomen. Flows of blood swagged his belly. He looked away and gritted his teeth as the African dabbed at him with a rag, then applied a thick black paste taken from a pot that the Frank carried in his saddlebags. ''I loved that hat almost as much as I love Hillel.''  At that moment the animal in question, a woolly stallion with a Roman nose and its neck a rampant arch, stubby-legged and broad in the croup, the product of some unsupervised tryst between an Arabian and a wild tarpan, gave a warning snort, and there was a scrape of leather sole against straw.  The Frank and the living African turned to the door. Expecting the ostler, thought the old elephant trainer, with their share of the take, which included four of the mahout's own hard-won dirhams.  ''You mendacious sons of bitches,'' the mahout said admiringly, reaching for the hilt of his sword.  Next week: The Frank and the African ponder a business proposition.

            "text": "  Written by Peter Morgan  At Balmoral Castle in Scotland, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) loads up the vehicle and then heads off across the property with her son Charles, the Prince of Wales (Alex Jennings), and her beloved dogs. The queen drives hard through woods, dust kicking up in the old Land Rover's wake. It's a bone-shaking ride.  Charles stares out the window, lost in thought.  CHARLES -- I was thinking last night what Diana might have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in Paris.  The queen privately rolls her eyes.  CHARLES -- She would certainly have taken the boys to Paris. I rather regret not doing that now.  ELIZABETH -- What? And expose them to the media? It would have been a dreadful thing to do. They're much better off here.  CHARLES -- Look, whatever else you may have thought of Diana -- she was a wonderful mother.  (A beat.)  She adored those boys. And never let them forget it.  (A beat.)  Always warm.  The queen's hands tighten on the steering wheel.  CHARLES -- And physical.  (A beat.)  Never afraid to show her feelings.  ELIZABETH -- Especially whenever a photographer was in sight.  CHARLES -- Yes, she may have encouraged all that, but still  Charles looks out of the window. His eyes mist over.  That was always the extraordinary thing about her. Her weakness and transgressions only seemed to make the public love her more. Yet ours only make them hate us. Why is that?  Charles looks up.  Why do they hate us so much?  The queen mutters under her breath.  ELIZABETH -- Not ''us,'' dear.  CHARLES -- (not having heard) What?  The queen salutes the gamekeepers, who remove their hats as the queen roars past.  CHARLES -- Yesterday, when we drove the coffin back into London, there was a noise. A bang. I don't mind telling you I thought it was a gun.  Charles's hands wring in anxiety.  CHARLES -- I thought someone had taken a shot at me.  The queen hits the brakes, and pulls up, visibly irritated by her son's weakness. She opens the door and steps out.  ELIZABETH -- Why don't you go on without me? I'm going to walk back.  CHARLES -- Are you sure?  ELIZABETH -- Yes. It looks like rain.  The dogs jump out.  And I'm not in the mood for stalking anyway.  THE OSCARS: EXCERPTS -- THE QUEEN  ",

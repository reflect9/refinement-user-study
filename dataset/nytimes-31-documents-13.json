            "text": "  It wasn't until the Hungarian photographer MARTIN MUNKACSI (1896-1963) turned his lens on fashion models that he made his fortune. But he established his reputation with reportage, much of it published in German photo weeklies. Now the International Center of Photography is mounting an exhibition of his work. The show, ''Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!,'' organized by F. C. Gundlach at the Haus der Photographie in Hamburg, includes more than 125 vintage photographs, along with magazines and page layouts. Mr. Munkacsi's images of models running on the beach revolutionized fashion photography by being natural rather than posed. Friday through April 29, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, icp.org.  It was the photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson who arguably put Mr. Munkacsi on the map, so taken was he with Mr. Munkacsi's photo ''Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika,'' taken in 1929 or 1930. Cartier-Bresson said of the picture, ''I suddenly understood that photography can fix eternity in a moment.'' It seems appropriate, then, that the International Center of Photography is simultaneously featuring an exhibition of Cartier-Bresson's work, which also starts Friday. Called ''HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON'S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,'' the show includes 251 prints personally selected and printed by the photographer. The show was originally assembled by the Museum of Modern Art as a memorial when Cartier-Bresson was presumed dead after having been held in German prisoner-of-war camps during World War II. (He actually escaped the camps and died in 2004 at 95.)  The WINTER ANTIQUES SHOW returns to the Seventh Regiment Armory on Friday with a core of 28 specialists in American antiques and art, including Shaker, folk art, American Indian, Colonial, Federal, Arts and Crafts, and Aesthetic Movement pieces. The show also features exhibitors showing British, European and Asian antiques, from old master paintings to Chinese export porcelain. Through Jan. 28, noon to 8 p.m. (to 6 p.m. on Jan 21, 25 and 28; to 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 20), Park Avenue at 67th Street, winterantiquesshow.com; $20.  ",

            "text": "  Although it has been a decade since the Museum of Modern Art's giant Jasper Johns retrospective, there have been a spate of smaller shows devoted to aspects of his work. Now the National Gallery of Art in Washington has put its own spin on his oeuvre with ''JASPER JOHNS: AN ALLEGORY OF PAINTING, 1955-1965,'' which opens today.  Not wanting it to seem like either another retrospective or a survey show, Jeffrey Weiss, the gallery's curator of modern and contemporary art, has traced this artist's work through four motifs: the target, the mechanical device, the stenciled naming of colors and the imprint of the body.  Included in the show will be 84 works from public and private collections, including the largest group of target paintings ever assembled. Among them is ''Target With Plaster Casts'' (1955), which is the image on the cover of the show's catalog. It has been lent by David Geffen, the entertainment mogul. Also on view will be many of Mr. Johns's most famous works, like ''False Start'' (1959), which now belongs to the Chicago collector Kenneth C. Griffin, and ''Jubilee'' (1960). Through April 29; nga.gov.  An exhibition devoted to another popular American artist, ROBERT GOBER, opens Saturday at two of the Matthew Marks Galleries in Chelsea. Like Mr. Johns, Mr. Gober is known for using familiar vernacular American forms in his work.  Consisting of only new works -- two sculptures and several drawings -- the exhibition will feature a sculpture of a plastic milk crate filled with sculptures of Granny Smith apples that rests on a cast of a wooden footstool in the space at 526 West 22nd Street. A block away, at 521 West 21st Street, will be a second cast of a wooden footstool, this one made with an old packing blanket folded on the seat. Through March 10; (212) 243-0200.  ",

            "text": "  Skoto Gallery  529 West 20th Street, Chelsea  Through Jan. 27  As one of New York's very few full-time commercial spaces devoted mainly to contemporary African art, Skoto Gallery is worth keeping an eye on. Its present show is a strong solo by the Congolese-born artist Aime Mpane, who divides his time between Kinshasa and Brussels.  Skoto's front gallery is given over to large sculptural installations that address Western pillaging of Africa, military and cultural, that gained full force in the late 19th century and continues. In one piece a tiny sculptural figure of a European soldier casts a huge drawn shadow on the gallery wall. In another, shown at the 2006 Dakar Biennial, the life-size figure of an African man, made entirely from matchsticks, stares at a grave marked 1885, the year Africa was definitively carved up and distributed among several European nations.  Even with colonialism ended, the mining of African culture continues, as suggested in a third sculpture, of the German artist and self-declared shaman Joseph Beuys kissing African feet. Some of the continuing effects of a disastrous past are evident in dozens of small paintings hung salon-style in the gallery's back room, all done during one of Mr. Mpane's recent stays in Kinshasa.  Most were painted at night by firelight or candlelight in a city short of electricity. (Mr. Mpane could fully see the paintings only hours after they were done, in daylight.) They are images made, like the whole show, of shadow and light, and they are extraordinary.  HOLLAND COTTER  ART IN REVIEW  ",

            "text": "  Rather than drifting through another big, bland blockbuster this week, why not focus on small shows? You can still see ''ART OF THE LEGA: MEANING AND METAPHOR IN CENTRAL AFRICA'' at AXA Gallery through Jan. 14. Lega men and women, from Congo, enter an initiation society at an early age to learn life skills and gain wisdom, and most Lega art is created as an instrument of moral teaching. The process of growth is complex and stimulating, on the evidence of the elegant sculptures and haunting masks here. 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 554-4818.  With a little traveling, you can piece together a mini-retrospective of the contemporary artist ELLSWORTH KELLY. In Chelsea all of Matthew Marks's galleries (at 522 West 22nd Street, 523 West 24th Street, 521 West 21st Street and 526 West 22nd Street) are devoted to him: two spaces with new abstract relief paintings, another with a single panoramic print, and yet another with a terrific series of shadow-derived notebook drawings from the 1950s that have much to say about the way this artist has related abstraction and the world. They are all on view through Jan. 27 (matthewmarks.com). Through February, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (philamuseum.org) has its own Kelly festival, notable for landmark pieces from his formative years in Paris.  Speaking of small surveys, one of the best, and most moving, shows of political art around is at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (through Feb. 25). ''DISSENT!'' brings together familiar pieces and rarely seen work. If all you know about Sister Corita (1918-86) is big strokes of abstract paint, check out the visually passionate topical prints here. Most interesting, though, are the relics of political activism at Harvard itself: a T-shirt with a raised-fist emblem was hand-printed in 1969 during a campus strike by design students. They worked around the clock, printing a political message on any object brought to them, for free. (617) 495-9400 or www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/fogg.  ",

It will go on view at 4 p.m. today. ''It's a thank you to donors who have already given and an inspiration for future gifts,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, the museum's director. She said that more than half the $68 million needed to buy the painting had been raised. Late last month the museum and the Academy announced that they would match the price that the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., had agreed to pay unless a local institution would pay an equal amount. The work will remain on view at the museum until early spring, when it will move to the Academy.  CAROL VOGEL  ",

            "text": "  The comprehensive retrospective of paintings by Colin Campbell Cooper at the Heckscher Museum of Art is anchored at both ends by distinguished paintings. At one end of the museum is ''Broad Street Ca\u00f1on, New York'' (1904), a skyscraper scene that made the artist's reputation; at the other end is the dreamy, atmospheric ''Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco'' (1916), a high point in the movement now known as California Impressionism.  These paintings, which could hardly be more different in terms of style, subject matter and palette, provide an apt metaphor for the artist's career, which can be divided into two distinct phases. The first consists of his New York and East Coast city skyscraper scenes, for which he is remembered and to which he would constantly return throughout his career. The second phase involves more rural, nostalgic and exotic scenery, mostly painted in California. This show affords an opportunity to compare these two largely distinct bodies of art.  Organized by the curators William H. Gerdts and Deborah Epstein Solon for the Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach, Calif., ''East Coast/West Coast and Beyond: Colin Campbell Cooper, American Impressionist'' brings together about 70 of the artist's paintings, gathered from museums and private collections all over the country. (The show travels to Laguna Beach after it closes here.) Together these works form a portrait of a successful, peripatetic artist, one who accumulated extensive honors and critical acclaim during his lifetime but who since has largely fallen into obscurity. The show suggests the reason for that: While individual pictures are wonderful, taken as a whole his work is less than compelling.  Born in Philadelphia, Cooper (1858-1937) was a student of Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Later, in Paris, he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian, where he studied with William Bouguereau, Jules-Joseph Lefebvre and Henri Lucien Doucet. It was also in Paris that he developed an interest in architecture, beginning with paintings of medieval architectural monuments, especially the great Gothic cathedrals. Though trained as a figurative painter, he would prefer the subject of architecture throughout his career.  Cooper exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1890, returning to America the following year. He continued to paint and travel widely, like other American artists of his generation, spending summers in Europe and winters back home working in his studio. Dordrecht, in the Netherlands, became one of his favored stomping grounds, and was the subject of several paintings from the mid- to late 1890s. Among them is ''Dordrecht Harbor'' (circa 1898), the most vibrant and accomplished of his early European scenes. He also painted in England, producing at least one masterpiece of atmosphere and light, ''Wells Cathedral'' (circa 1902).  Cooper's interest in historic European architecture led him, beginning around 1903, to take up painting the theme with which his art and reputation have largely become associated: towering buildings and the smoky skyline of the new American skyscraper city. It was epitomized by New York, though this was not the only modern city that he painted. Showing here is a fine pair of views of Philadelphia, the artist focusing on architectural structures like the curved glass and iron shed built over Broad Street Station.  In many ways, Cooper's modern city and skyscraper paintings reflect the mood of optimism and ambition that pervaded American society in this period. More prosaically, they also capture the changing face of American cities, the artist picturing landmark structures as they are being built or when newly constructed -- for instance, the distinctive, domed 47-story Singer Building (1908) in New York, which is the centerpiece of his panoramic ''Mountains of Manhattan'' (circa 1903). At the time, this was the tallest building in the world.  Though Cooper made a specialty of this theme, he was neither the first nor the only artist to paint the modern American city. New York street scenes and modern urban architecture attracted the attention of many artists, among them Childe Hassam (1859-1935), the American Impressionist painter with whom Cooper is most often compared. With the exception of Hassam's famous flag series (1916-1919), his New York street scenes date primarily from the early to mid-1890s, thus predating Cooper's by almost a decade. They are also better painted.  In the exhibition catalog, the curators make much of the fact that Hassam preferred to paint more intimate urban views, whereas Cooper concentrated on buildings and the majestic skyline. This is true, but it is not to say that Hassam did not also paint these things, as shown by his ''Lower Manhattan (View Down Broad Street)'' (1907), recently on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a retrospective of his work. It is painted from almost exactly the same place as Cooper's ''Broad Street Ca\u00f1on, New York'' and another, similar picture, ''The Financial District'' (circa 1908). Yet Hassam's painting is far superior.  Whereas Hassam's painting is tighter and more focused, the artist using scale, composition and light to create a sense of spatial compression to convey a dark canyon between buildings, Cooper includes too much open sky at top, while also widening the foreground roadway to a point where the viewer's eye nearly drifts out of the bottom of the painting. The two artists are not in the same league. Perhaps this is why, despite the rising interest in American Impressionism starting in the 1960s, Cooper's work has largely been ignored.

            "text": "  All collection shows are idiosyncratic. No random sampling of a museum's basement storage racks, with many categories of art to choose from and uneven levels of quality and significance, can be fully comprehensive.  The collection of 20th-century painting and drawing at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford is better than most, for this is America's oldest public art museum. And from its storage vaults comes ''Picasso to Pop: Aspects of Modern Art,'' an exhibition mapping the museum's history of acquiring works of 20th-century art. Approximately 60 rarely exhibited works are featured.  As in most collection shows, the positioning of the artworks is not strictly chronological, and it is not really arranged by themes, at least not any that might easily be determined by the casual visitor. It merely invites us to look, feel, mutter over and enjoy. No frills, no fuss.  Of course, the downside of this kind of display is that the pictures are largely wrenched out of context, lacking any sense of a unified purpose. Though it is wonderful to see artworks rarely put on display, context is vital when trying to determine art's meaning and significance. It enables comparisons, and the illustration of connections to supposed forebears in art.  The opening room samples different strains of modernism -- Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism and Surrealism, among others -- but it is by no means a survey. In the space of one wall we jump from Picasso to Fernand L\u00e9ger, to Wyndham Lewis to Egon Schiele and Otto Dix. The idea, as I understand it, is to illustrate how Cubism spawned various painterly trends in early modern art.  Though the painting by Mr. Lewis is valuable and important, there are actually few great works of art here. The Atheneum's best early moderns are already on display in the Avery Court, an area devoted to the permanent collection immediately outside the galleries, where you find famous paintings by Dal\u00ed, Mir\u00f3, Mondrian, Tanguy, Picasso and others. The nearby presence of these masterworks makes those in the exhibition look worse than they are.  What this new show does offer, however, is a chance to spend time with first-rate works by lesser artists, among them three little-known female Surrealists: Stella Snead, Kay Sage and Leonor Fini.  Born in Argentina and raised in Italy, Ms. Fini (1908-1996) has a sensuous self-portrait on display. She depicts herself as slim, with intense ''cat-like eyes,'' as a wall label notes, wearing a festive costume.  Ms. Snead (1910-2006), who was British, studied painting in London before moving to New York in 1939. The following year she traveled across the United States by bus. Ms. Snead, a vegetarian, was fascinated by the Southwest, where she returned in the early 1940s and began to paint dreamy landscape scenes with animals. ''Ecstatic Cow'' (1943) depicts a happy cow in a farmyard scene.  The second room of the exhibition introduces us to talented, if little remembered, modern Latin American painters, among them Carlos M\u00e9rida, Jes\u00fas Guerrero Galv\u00e1n and Mario Carreno. The most striking work of this group is ''La Vigornia'' (The Little Nurse) (1937) by Mr. Galv\u00e1n (1910-1973), a Mexican artist, which shows a girl holding a child. This was one of two modern Mexican paintings that the Atheneum's former director, A. Everett Austin Jr., bought on a visit to Mexico in 1939. The other was by Diego Rivera.  From here the selection narrows, focusing chiefly on American postwar artists beginning with representative abstract paintings by Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman and Robert Motherwell. None of them are terribly good, with the exception of the Pollock, ''Number 9'' (1949), which was a gift to the museum in the late 1960s by the abstract sculptor Tony Smith, who had his first retrospective at the Atheneum in 1967 and subsequently donated to the museum several works of his artist friends.  The final room is devoted to Pop art, specifically by the American painters Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Wayne Thiebaud. Mr. Rauschenberg's ''Retroactive I'' (1964) is a famous, important painting, but one that is frequently on show in the permanent collection rooms here. Less known, or shown, are some of Mr. Lichtenstein's screenprints on a variety of plastic surfaces.  The curators have chosen to close the show with a painted aluminum silhouette by Alex Katz titled ''Margie'' (1971), commissioned by the Atheneum board of trustees in honor of Margarie Ellis, who worked as registrar at the museum for 54 years before retiring in 1973.  It is a touching if kitschy tribute. At one time or another, almost all the artworks in this exhibition passed through Ms. Ellis's hands.

            "text": "  Matthew Marks Gallery  522 and 526 West 22nd Street; 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea  All through Jan. 27  There is a great candor to Ellsworth Kelly's art, and always has been, as you can see in what amounts to a small survey of early and recent work at Matthew Marks's various Chelsea galleries. The largest, on West 22nd Street, has a half-dozen of the artist's new abstract relief paintings, made of superimposed geometric panels. They're like altarpiece diptychs with subtly mismatched halves that stack rather than fold.  Each painting plays, in a straightforward way, with ideas that the artist, now 83, has been exploring for more than 60 years: the interrelationship, even interchangeability, of painting with sculpture; the creation of fictional objects in real space; the way abstraction can be its own kind of naturalism, intellectually demanding but utterly unesoteric, as plain and packed as a book.  Although Mr. Kelly's work is often associated with bright colors, these new pictures are in black and white. And that in itself has a long history in his career, as is demonstrated in a series of early works on paper in an adjoining gallery. Titled ''Drawings on a Bus -- Sketchbook 23, 1954,'' the series was done just after he had moved to New York, where he developed a form of abstraction inspired by the world around him.  The landmark painting ''Cit\u00e9'' (1951) is an example. It's like an image of light flickering on dark water, but translated into patterns of black-and-white bars. (The image is recaptured in a singe large print installed in Marks's window-only space on West 21st Street.)  ''Drawings on a Bus -- Sketchbook 23, 1954'' is what it says it is: a sequence of black ink sketches inspired by a changing shadow cast on a book the artist was reading on a bus ride. The main form starts as a small curve, then gradually swells; if you could look at the drawings flipbook-style, you'd see the black form expand to fill the white page. The sequence, drawn without guile or frills, is a record from nature and a fresh invention, from which the artist derived several black-and-white paintings.  There are more, unstacked double-panel pieces in the West 24th Street space. Here color returns, not quite bright, not quite subdued, complicated but not all that complicated -- monumental the way a tall open window, a mature rose bush or a Shaker dresser is monumental. They aren't.  HOLLAND COTTER  ART IN REVIEW  ",

            "text": "  IN 1925 Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez (1895-1963), the great self-taught draftsman, left his small ranch in the Jalisco region of Mexico for work in the promised land of the United States. He never returned to his wife and four children back home, spending more than three decades confined to psychiatric hospitals after being picked up off the streets of California in 1931: jobless, homeless, confused and unable to communicate in English.  But in the 300 drawings Mr. Ram\u00edrez created over the last 15 years of his life -- after being sent to DeWitt State Hospital near Sacramento with a diagnosis of catatonic schizophrenia -- he revisits the scenes of his young adulthood: the horse and rider, trains and tunnels, Madonnas, animals and landscape of his native Mexico.  ''He was a landscape artist obsessed with memory,'' said Brooke Davis Anderson, director and curator of the American Folk Art Museum's Contemporary Center. ''Mexico breathes in his work.''  ''Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez,'' opening Tuesday at the museum with 97 of these works (including the untitled one below), moves beyond the traditional view of Mr. Ram\u00edrez as a deaf and mute schizophrenic artist. It interprets his artistic merits by looking at the work as art shaped by poverty, immigration and institutionalization.  He was making art before his time at DeWitt; he decorated his letters home and made drawings at Stockton State Hospital, where he was first institutionalized. But there is no record that any of that work survived. He was never interviewed.  After his transfer to DeWitt in 1948, he met Tarmo Pasto, an artist and psychology professor at Sacramento State College, who began to collect Mr. Ram\u00edrez's drawings. Mr. Pasto introduced him to local artists and to some of his students, including the painter Wayne Thiebaud, who recalls having brief conversations in Spanish with Mr. Ram\u00edrez.  Mr. Pasto also arranged for Mr. Ram\u00edrez's work to be exhibited, which he was aware of from newspaper articles the hospital saved. Reviewing a group show at the de Young Museum, Alfred Frankenstein of The San Francisco Chronicle called Mr. Ram\u00edrez the ''most striking artist'' in the exhibition, one with ''an innate gift for form, color and pictorial organization'' whose art ''went deep into recollections of his country's folk art.''  But the glory that Mr. Ram\u00edrez may have longed for never arrived. In accordance with California laws protecting the privacy of mental patients, he could not be mentioned by name. Instead he was called simply, ''an aged Mexican.''  He fared no better in New York. In the 1950s, Mr. Pasto sent a tube holding 10 of Mr. Ram\u00edrez's drawings to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum for a show that never happened. They were put into storage. The museum now has the largest public cache of Mr. Ram\u00edrez's work -- though the drawings came to light only 40 years later when an intern stumbled upon them.

            "text": "  Claude Monet will forever be known for his dreamy Impressionist canvases of grain stacks and cathedrals, the seaside and of course the famous water lilies and gardens that surrounded his beloved home in Giverny. Unlike Degas, C\u00e9zanne or Pissarro, contemporaries whose reputations rested on works on paper as well as canvases, Monet was the epitome of the plein-air painter.  Whenever a journalist or collector asked him how he worked, he talked incessantly about the liberating possibilities of painting outdoors, forgoing any mention of the sketches, pastels and prints he quietly produced throughout his life.  ''Monet wanted to present himself as the great painter of his day,'' said Richard Kendall, curator at large at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. ''It was a kind of PR exercise, a way of defining himself. But the big, teasing question has always been why didn't he want people to know he drew?''  Three years ago Mr. Kendall and James A. Ganz, the Clark's curator of prints, drawings and photographs, set out to answer that question. Their findings are the focus of ''The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings,'' an exhibition of about 100 works -- drawings, sketchbooks and prints, along with some related paintings -- that opens on March 17 at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and will arrive on June 24 at the Clark.  The curators say their exhibition will show that Monet wasn't the anti-draftsman he led the public to believe, and that he relied on drawing both to prepare for his paintings and as an independent form of expression.  He drew throughout his seven-decade career, filling pocket-size sketchbooks when he was a truculent teenager and executing pastel drawings of seascapes when he was in his 20s. He drew in different ways using different materials, and in his final years made abstract crayon and pencil drawings as studies for his water-lily paintings.  Although Monet helped perpetrate the myth that he did not, and maybe even could not, draw, nearly 500 of more than 2,500 works mentioned in his catalogue raisonn\u00e9 are sketchbooks, drawings and pastels. Yet, until now, few scholars have paid much attention to them.  They figure prominently in the fifth and final volume of the catalogue raisonn\u00e9, published by Daniel Wildenstein in 1991 and devoted primarily to works on paper. But when the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 was reprinted in 1996, that volume was dropped.  Mr. Ganz was unaware of just how little most scholars knew about Monet's drawings until he began researching a view of Rouen drawn in crayon in 1883 and owned by the Clark Institute. ''It was an object that caught my eye especially because I knew it was done after a painting,'' he said.  (He said the painting, which is in a private European collection, will be united with the drawing for the first time in the exhibition.)  The more he began to dig, Mr. Ganz said, the more strongly he felt that there was no substantive scholarly examination of Monet's drawings.  He approached Mr. Kendall about the possibility of jointly organizing a small show centering on the Clark's Rouen drawing. But after embarking on their research, they began to envision a far larger exhibition. ''We began asking colleagues about Monet's works on paper and consistently got the same reaction -- a blank stare,'' Mr. Ganz said.  After approaching MaryAnne Stevens, a Monet scholar at the Royal Academy, who agreed that the potential show could travel there, the two American curators set out to find as many of Monet's works on paper as they could. Searching in Japan as well as in Europe and the United States, they eventually came up with the nearly 100 works that will be in the show.  The Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet in Paris, which owns eight of Monet's mature sketchbooks, dating from the 1860s through the 1920s, proved a particularly useful source. A colleague there alerted them to the existence of an unpublished journal by Count Th\u00e9ophile B\u00e9guin Billecocq, a friend of the Monet family who was himself an amateur draftsman. The only known firsthand account of Monet's early life, it depicts him as a young man devoted to drawing. Written over roughly a 30-year period, starting in 1854, the journal has remained in the family, passing eventually to the count's great-grandson, Xavier B\u00e9guin Billecocq, a historian of the Persian Gulf region.  ''It became clear to us that we had stumbled on something quite critical,'' Mr. Ganz said of the manuscript. ''It gave us a wealth of information.''  Interspersed throughout the journal are observations about Monet. When the artist was 17, for instance, B\u00e9guin Billecocq described his rapid sketching technique as ''Impressionistic.''  Yet the drawings themselves, he wrote, were ''detailed, as precise as reality, and delicate, representing the houses, trees, people, etc., in the best possible manner.''  In a telephone interview, Xavier B\u00e9guin Billecocq said that Monet often drew in the countryside or at the sea while on vacation with the B\u00e9guin Billecocq family. ''They would go exploring the surrounding countryside, often sketching in the woods,'' Dr. B\u00e9guin Billecocq said. ''He drew in the country in places like Deauville and Honfleur.''  The journal also captures the flavor of Parisian life in an era when friends got together to play musical instruments, attend the opera and concerts and simply draw.  ''It gives a good description of the youth and social environment of Monet,'' Dr. B\u00e9guin Billecocq said. ''You see him growing up, needing money. My great-grandfather would help him, giving him money to buy paper and supplies.''  The early sketchbooks described in the journal are pencil studies of local architecture, trees, sailboats and pastoral scenes. ''His sketches, whether in crayon or pencil, were always excellent, even if they were rapidly executed,'' Th\u00e9ophile B\u00e9guin Billecocq wrote in his journal. ''He knew how to capture the essential characteristics of a scene.''  In another revelation he notes that around 1862, the year Monet turned 22, the artist decided to be known as Claude, his middle name, rather than Oscar, his first.  Drafted into the army and sent to Algiers, Monet had been teased by his regiment about the ''ridiculous'' name Oscar.  ''Goodbye Oscar, long live Claude,'' B\u00e9guin Billecocq writes facetiously. It explains why some of the early drawings are signed Oscar and later works Claude. (Monet signed only some of his works on paper.)  While the manuscript, titled ''Grand Journal,'' is too fragile to be in the exhibition, the curators say, quotations from it will be incorporated into the installation as a way of telling the story of the artist's life.  Still, questions about Monet's development remain. ''It's easy to separate the youthful work,'' said Mr. Kendall of the Clark. ''It is less distinctive and powerful.'' By the mid-1860s, he said, Monet was making ''brilliant'' drawings of the Normandy coast with a waxy black crayon. ''But we still don't know why he did them,'' Mr. Kendall said.  In the first Impressionist Exhibition in 1874 in Paris, however, Monet showed seven of his pastels, their research shows, but they were not included in the catalog or mentioned by any critics. ''It's one of the puzzles in Monet scholarship,'' Mr. Kendall said, adding that Monet ''takes it up again in the 1880s, and for two weeks in 1901 when he went to London and his canvases didn't arrive.''  He added, ''He wanted to work, so he made pastels of London bridges and rivers.''  Of 26 pastels that can be datedto that time, 6 will be in the exhibition, along with two paintings, of the Waterloo Bridge (1901) and Charing Cross Bridge (about 1900).  Like van Gogh, Monet also created works on paper based on actual paintings. ''He wasn't consistent, but had many different manners of drawing,'' Mr. Ganz said, adding: '' A lot had to do with his public-private issue. Some, that were sketchy, were meant only for his private use, while others, more in the style of his paintings, were finished works in themselves.''  Mr. Ganz said he thought the most surprising drawings were those related to the water-lily paintings. Minimalist in style and not pretty like the paintings themselves, these drawings, in black, white and violet crayon, can best be described as agitated, abstract and almost Expressionistic.  ''He never meant for the public to see them,'' Mr. Kendall said, adding: ''It all comes back to marketing. His public image was important to him, and drawings complicated that picture. In fact, they even contradicted it.''  ''The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings'' will be at the Royal Academy of Arts in London from March 17 to June 10, and at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., from June 24 to Sept. 16.

            "text": "  A Trove of Americana, Filled With Heart, Goes on the Block  There are many ways to collect American antiques, and those ways come into focus every January as collectors, curators and dealers flood into New York for the Winter Antiques Show, the American Antiques Show, the Stella Americana at the Piers show and auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's.  There is the slow and meticulous collecting model, exemplified by Bertram K. and Nina Fletcher Little, a Massachusetts couple who researched every piece of Americana they bought over a 60-year period, beginning in 1928. They published more than 150 scholarly articles and several exhibition catalogs before they both died in 1993.  And then there is the relatively quick and intense collecting model, which Mark and Susan Laracy, a Connecticut couple, followed as they formed a collection in 25 years. They are selling 225 pieces of American antique furniture and folk art at Sotheby's on Jan. 20.  After buying their first antique in 1982 from the veteran Stonington, Conn., dealer Marguerite Riordan at the Winter Antiques Show, the Laracys plunged into the Americana world with unfettered enthusiasm. Every year they attended the Americana auctions in Portsmouth, N.H., visited the Skinner sales in Boston and scoured the antiques fairs and auction houses in New York.  Now they are selling everything in a single-owner sale that is expected to bring $3 million to $6 million. It includes folk art portraits by John Brewster Jr., Sheldon Peck, Sturtevant J. Hamblen and Ammi Phillips, as well as New England highboys, chairs, chests and desks. One standout is a Queen Anne mahogany desk and bookcase with original finials, brass hardware and pad feet that was made in the Connecticut River Valley in the late 1700s.  Why was Americana so appealing to the Laracys? ''When you are 40, you want to convey an image of stability and having had ancestors, even if you come from nowhere,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''Americana provides that.'' A former perfume executive, Mr. Laracy established his company, Parfums de Coeur, when he was 40; sales of its inexpensive versions of popular designer fragrances are now $100 million a year.  After that first purchase at the Winter Antiques Show, the Laracys began collecting Americana seriously under the guidance of Mrs. Riordan. ''She controlled our brains for 10 years,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''If we were attracted to a piece for aesthetic reasons, she made sure there were no condition issues, that the piece was unique and retained its original color.''  Several important works came through Mrs. Riordan, from small sculptures to needlepoint samplers to major Queen Anne Connecticut case pieces: a cherry bonnet-top high chest, a small cherry dressing table, a cherry blanket chest and a maple tavern table.  Equally important are four portraits by Brewster, the itinerant deaf painter. Mrs. Riordan negotiated the acquisition of a pair of large Brewster portraits depicting Maj. Daniel Coffin and his wife, Elizabeth Stone Coffin, of Newburyport, Mass. She persuaded Eddy G. Nicholson, a New Hampshire investor and part owner of the Congoleum Corporation, to sell them to the Laracys.  ''We never did meet Eddy Nicholson, but I can tell you it took two years to agree on a price with him,'' Mr. Laracy said. Sotheby's estimate for the pair is $150,000 to $300,000.  Mrs. Riordan also sold the Laracys a smaller-scale pair of Brewster portraits, of a brother and sister. They show a sensitivity to children and are similar in feeling to the children's portraits in the current Brewster show at the American Folk Art Museum, which closes on Sunday.  The sale is also noteworthy for its wealth of little objects: a whalebone knitting basket, a carved slate plaque with a couple dressed in Indian attire, an engraved and scrimshawed whale ivory watch stand and a Windsor cradle.  ''I love smalls,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''They have a tactile quality.''  Elisabeth Donaghy Garrett, an Americana expert, author and educator, noted another characteristic of the collection: charm.  ''It is an exceptional collection in terms of provenance, outstanding form, condition, outline and color,'' she said, ''but the theme that popped out at me is love, or affection, which comes through pictorially. There are pieces with hearts and courting couples on textiles and plaques. There's a playfulness that carries through.''  One hooked rug shows 34 children jumping rope, skating, fishing and dancing around a maypole, with a banner reading ''Children will play, four seasons round.''  Collectors of Americana typically focus on either furniture or folk art, but the Laracys collected both. The sale includes a group of 19 blue-decorated salt-glazed stoneware vessels, a weather vane, whimsical andirons and a bird cage in addition to all the antique furniture.  ''Our approach was to focus on the finest examples we could find across a number of categories,'' Mr. Laracy said.  Provenance seems to have been particularly important to the Laracys, who organized the lots in the catalog by provenance.  Apart from Eddy Nicholson's portraits, there are several pieces formerly owned by the Littles, including a magnificent Hamblen folk art portrait of a girl in a white dress that is estimated at $100,000 to $300,000. Other pieces were once owned by such serious collectors as Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Paul and Margaret Weld, Virginia Ramsey-Pope Cave, Burton and Helaine Fendelman and John Howland Ricketson III.  The Laracys are selling their Georgian colonial house in New Canaan, Conn., and moving into Manhattan. They now plan to collect contemporary art and 20th-century modern furniture: ''a mix of American, Italian and French,'' Mr. Laracy said.  ''We are changing our lives,'' he added.  The presale viewing begins next weekend, on Jan. 13. On the morning of Jan. 18 Sotheby's Institute of Art is to hold a private tour of the collection and a symposium with Ms. Garrett; Paul S. D'Ambrosio, director of the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y.; and Thomas P. and Alice K. Kugelman, authors of a definitive study on Connecticut River Valley furniture.

            "text": "  In an age when the mantle of outsider can seem like just another fashionable pose, the OUTSIDER ART FAIR in the Puck Building has a quaint ring to it. But this 15-year-old fair can still provide the unexpected. It includes a daunting sample of paintings by self-taught hobbyists, eccentrics and the clinically insane. And although the work is notoriously uneven, it remains a welcome counterpoint to the increasingly predictable slickness of the contemporary art scene. Friday through Jan. 28, 295 Lafayette Street, SoHo, (212) 777-5218.  Those searching for a more ethereal experience should take a trip to ''LACE AND SUBVERSIVE KNITTING'' at the Museum of Arts and Design, an exhibition that bridges the divide between high art and low craft. The show, which groups together 27 artists from seven countries, offers a range of works with different sensibilities, from a tiny pair of red mittens by the artist Althea Merback to Janet Echelman's enormous diaphanous webs, whose soft, billowing forms shift delicately in the wind. Through June 17, 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-3535.  By comparison ''PRIVATE TREASURES: FOUR CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTER DRAWINGS,'' at the Morgan Library & Museum, should be a comfort to those who prefer a more comfortingly classical art experience. On display are weighty 16th-century masterpieces like Agnolo Bronzino's ''Study of the Dead Christ.'' But pay particular attention to Watteau's delicious sketch of a man playing a guitar, as well as Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Vincent's ''Drawing Lesson,'' with its undertones of sexual tension. Through April 8, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008.  Correction:  January 28, 2007, Sunday  An Art entry last Sunday in the Week Ahead report gave an incomplete title for an exhibition at the Museum of Arts and Design.

            "text": "  Mature is the word in the trade for fairs like the Winter Antiques Show, though time-honored, even venerable, would be closer to the mark. The show, which opens today, has been around forever (well, since 1955). It delivers substantial, sometimes spectacular retail; always has. Dealers and clients alike return, like swallows to Capistrano, year after year. So if solid tradition, rather than Art Basel Miami Beach-style blowouts, is what you want in a fair, this one's for you.  Content-wise too it is a grown-up show (though I suspect that kids with doubloons to spend will not be turned from the door). The best material is geared to seasoned eyes, sophisticated budgets and meditated decision making rather than to random drive-by shopping.  Finally, this fair is multiplicitous in ways that few others are anymore. Half a century ago the specialty fair -- Outsider, Asian, Tribal, Ceramics -- hadn't been invented. Shows were omnibus things with antiques and antiquities, Buddhas and bracelets, chef-d'oeuvres and doodads. The Winter Antiques Show encompasses all of these and more, with an ardent mix-it-up spirit that was once called eclectic and is now called postmodern.  As established as it is, though, the show is not staid. It is famous, as one is reminded with a slight shock every year, for its adventurous ''look,'' a certain real-faux, regal-populist picturesqueness, like a cross between, say, the Wrightsman galleries at the Met and Wigstock. Each booth has its own done-up style. The one occupied by Elle Shushan, from Philadelphia, exemplifies the general mode.  Appropriately for a dealer specializing in miniature paintings, Ms. Shushan's space is extra-small, seven by seven or something like that. But, with wall-covering silk-screened drawings designed by another dealer, Ralph Harvard, she has transformed it into the great hall of an 18th-century colonial Georgian plantation house -- one that actually exists, named Westover, in Virginia. Purists will snicker and sniff: the walls of Ms. Shushan's Westover are fuchsia. As it happens, the blushy tone does wonders for tallowy New York winter complexions, and, more important, it sets off to advantage the booth's prize display: a 1901 portrait miniature of the future Kings George VI and Edward VIII, at ages 6 and 7 respectively.  It was painted by the artist Gertrude Massey, who earned royal favor for her portraits of Queen Victoria's dogs. The picture comes with an entire documentary archive of letters and clips. And the princes, in matching sailor suits, look right at home in their mock-colonial digs.  A lot of the fair is made up of similarly nested histories, most of them American. At Thomas Colville Fine Art there's a terrifically winning portrait by John Singleton Copley of his sister-in-law, Sarah Clarke Startin; you can tell from the zesty way he painted her that he liked her. In the artist's family from the time it was done, around 1783, it trails multigenerational stories behind it.  Alexander Gallery has a moody, mystical Thomas Cole biblical scene as its centerpiece. More accurately, the gallery believes it has two Coles in one. X-rays -- you can ask to see them -- reveal that the present painting covers an earlier one, possibly a version of his ''Hagar in the Wilderness,'' long thought lost, but for which drawings exist.  A stately Philadelphia Queen Anne secretary desk, with a zillion movable parts, at G. K. S. Bush offers a concrete example of a hidden masterwork fully revealed. The desk was made in the early 18th century, but in the mid-19th century it was covered with a coat of lacquerlike black paint in a technique called japanning. Recently the piece was spotted for what it is and the overpaint was stripped off, except on one interior panel, a souvenir of an Orientalist past.  If you were combing the show for overarching themes, Orientalism, defined as the adaptation of Asian motifs to Western forms, is a strong candidate. Michele Beiny has two stolid Prussian ''Chinese'' vases made around 1840, when Europe was on one of its recurrent Far East jags.  At Roger Keverne, dragons and putti cavort side by side on an 18th-century Chinese silk bed-covering -- in imperial yellow, no less -- made for export. And in Elinor Gordon's booth you'll find a shipful of China Trade porcelains, of a kind that gave the West an image of China that the Chinese thought the West wanted to see.  Ms. Gordon's display is also a classic demonstration of how visually effective a concentration of like or similar forms can be. Other dealers know this too. Peter Finer's space, bristling with firearms, has a trigger-happy look you don't forget. Macklowe Gallery suggests an Art Nouveau explosion. Julius Lowy has erected a whole glowing house -- tiny but yes, a house -- of gilded picture frames.  Still, individual objects stand out everywhere, either for their beauty, their historical weight or their oddity. A 13th-century Umbrian Italian Virgin, with mesmerized eyes, at Richard Philip, is one. An exquisite Egyptian bronze head of a cat at Rupert Wace is another. A Yupik Eskimo dance mask at Donald Ellis, with an immense carved hand wrapped around its hallucinatory, fly-apart face, is a third. All fill the bill on all three counts.  Add to them Teotihuacan carvings at Throckmorton Fine Art, fantastic Oceanic masks at Conru Primitive Art and early American portraits at Peter Tillou, and a message comes clear: Geopolitical encounters, across the centuries, across continents and across art-fair aisles, are what make the world of art the thrilling, forward-looking place it is.  To be sure, other sorts of encounters spice it up too. I refer you to the duel of jewels at the very center of the show, where two galleries, James Robinson and A La Vieille Russie, each with blinding, wearable arrays of precious metal and rock, sit diagonally across from each other. They call their merchandise art; I call it bling and say it's fierce. Caught between the booths, you might as well just surrender to both.  Then, to power down a bit, drop by this year's special loan exhibition, a selection of pieces from the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts, which opened in Winston-Salem, N.C., in 1965, when the Winter Antiques Show was already a decade old. In its cultural variety, the museum's collection, with European, American and African-America influence mingling, resembles the texture of the fair. Yet the loan exhibition feels quiet and pulse-soothing, like a retreat from the hubbub around it.  What's the difference? No price tags. No pitch. No desire or scent of the hunt in the air. In the museum show everything is already spoken for; all you can do is look, and think, and wonder. Which is of course exactly what some of us have been coming, gratefully, to this grand old-new fair itself to do for years.

            "text": "  Long viewed as the domain of grandmothers, needlework has undergone an image makeover in the last decade. Snowboarders, the old torchbearers of alt.culture, have embraced crocheting, making beanies to wear on the slopes; coffeehouses and subways are filled with fashion-conscious types busily knitting or doing needlepoint. And contemporary artists like Andrea Zittel, Lisa Anne Auerbach, Orly Genger and Jim Drain and the Forcefield collective have given crafts a coolly conceptual edge.  Time then for an exhibition celebrating the unfrumpiness of craft, and, sigh, what better institution than one that recently went through its own makeover, changing its name from the American Craft Museum to the sexier Museum of Arts & Design?  The sorry news is that, despite its title, ''Radical Lace & Subversive Knitting,'' with around 40 works by 27 artists, is not a benchmark for introducing such crafts' coolness or radicalism to a vast art audience. Rather than exploring transgressive takes on knitting, the exhibition, organized by David Revere McFadden, the museum's chief curator, devotes most of its space to art that mimics the look or logic of knitting and lace and translates it into different materials.  In an essay in the show's catalog, Mr. McFadden does invoke interactive performances held in abandoned warehouses and the London Underground and people who knit sweaters for ''oil-spill-damaged penguins to wear in Antarctica'' -- the kind of activities you might associate with radical or subversive practice.  But in choosing the work for the show, he cites somewhat dated textile and crafts-based artists like Sophie Taeuber, Sonia Delaunay, Judy Chicago and Magdalena Abakanowicz as his models.  Much of the art on view is in the large-scale, virtuosic craft vein. Henk Wolvers's flat sculptures created with porcelain slip, a form of liquid clay, borrow the tracery if not the actual patterns of lace. Piper Shepard's ''Lace Meander'' is a series of hanging muslin scrolls into which the artist cut lace patterns with an X-Acto knife. Bennett Battaile's delicate sculpture of thin glass rods and Barbara Zucker's rubber sculptures both invoke lace-tracery in heavier materials.  Some of the artists address ''issues of politics, gender and ethics,'' as a wall text puts it, in a general way. Janet Echelman's giant, hand-knotted nylon net hanging from the ceiling in the museum's entryway recreates the look of a nuclear mushroom cloud. Freddie Robins's sinister-looking gray-knit bodysuit, with the words ''Craft Kills'' emblazoned across the chest, alludes to the airline ban on knitting needles in the post-9/11 era.  The works most in keeping with the show's politically charged title are more interactive and collective, or more related to performance. For example, Cat Mazza's collectively crocheted ''Nike Blanket Petition,'' a campaign against sweatshop practices represented here in a series of photographs, will be sent to Nike's corporate headquarters.  A video of Dave Cole's ''Knitting Machine'' project shows two John Deere excavators wielding telephone poles tapered to look like knitting needles -- and missiles -- to knit a giant American flag in the courtyard of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, Mass.  Sabrina Gschwandtner, an artist and founder of KnitKnit magazine, has set up a ''Wartime Knitting Circle'' surrounded by panels made of industrially knitted photos of Vietnam War protesters knitting, British women knitting woolen covers for World War II hand grenades, soldiers knitting during World War I.  She invites people to join her in knitting ''blankets for recovery'' for people in Afghanistan and troops convalescing in military hospitals, among other projects. (On the exhibition's opening day, Ms. Gschwandtner was chatting and knitting with Phyllis Rodriguez, whose son died in the north tower of the World Trade Center on 9/11 and who has since befriended A\u00efcha el-Wafi, mother of Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent serving a life sentence after his conspiracy conviction in the 9/11 attacks.  Needlework indeed has a radical past. William Morris, a mainstay of the Royal School of Needlework and the Arts and Crafts movement in England, protested late-19th-century industrial production. Feminist art in the 1970s drew heavily on so-called women's work, and Rosemarie Trockel's ''knitting pictures'' of the 1980s cleverly drew on political themes.  So many more artists might have been included whose work explores the social aspects of knitting and lace or who more radically recast these forms: Simon Perotin, of the punk-doily creations; the artisans in the Church of Craft; Ms. Zittel; Ms. Auerbach;, Mr. Drain; and so on.  Given the show's title, some visitors will arrive wanting to know how needlework, which runs counter to our technology- and information-saturated age, has become such a cultural juggernaut, and how it might serve to break down the barriers between artist and amateur, art and craft. A few works here may well satisfy that desire. Most will not.  Stitch Hunts  ''Radical Lace & Subversive Knitting'' runs through June 17 at the Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 8 p.m. on Thursdays); closed on holidays.

A series of public programs related to the exhibition is planned, including lectures, panel discussions, performance pieces and workshops in knitting, lace-making, crocheting, fabric-making, fabric-printing and digital design. Some events are free with museum admission; others require an additional fee that includes admission.  Beginning tomorrow and running every Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m. through June 3 will be ''Well Crafted Weekends: Inter-Generational Workshops,'' for those 6 and older; $7 per person or per family (up to four people). A detailed schedule is on the Web site.  ART REVIEW  ",

            "text": "  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901) possessed a magical talent for drawing. Encouraged by his friends and family, he studied portrait and religious painting in Paris in the 1880s before dedicating himself to a life of profligacy and becoming a habitu\u00e9 of Parisian bars, cabarets, cafes and brothels. Famously, this world became the subject of his most brilliant posters, drawings, lithographs and paintings.  But there was another side to Toulouse-Lautrec's art, one that the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum seeks to show in ''Toulouse-Lautrec and the French Imprint: Fin-de-Si\u00e8cle Posters in Paris, Brussels and Barcelona.'' The artist was a pioneer of modern advertising imagery. From the late 1880s on, he produced a series of innovative, monumental mass-market lithographic posters advertising more prosaic themes -- serial novels, magazines, books, products and even the Ault & Wiborg Company, makers of fine inks, based in Cincinnati.  Although the inspiration for these posters was purely commercial, they nonetheless possessed lasting artistic value. Successive rooms of this sprawling, eye-caressing exhibition reveal that the stylistic innovations of Toulouse-Lautrec's poster designs from the 1880s to 1900 influenced myriad modernist artists, first in Paris, then later in other parts of Europe. His embrace of lithographic printing and the mass-produced poster also helped elevate these lowly popular-art forms to the realm of high art.  The show of more than 130 French, Spanish and Belgian posters is arranged thematically, beginning with a small display devoted to lithography in the 19th century. Lithography is the simplest of the printed arts, the artist drawing with a greasy crayon or ink onto a limestone printing stone or plate, resulting in prints that replicate the hand-drawn lines and gestures. The technique was invented by the German playwright Alois Senefelder in 1798, though it soon gained popularity with artists for use in book and magazine illustration and was later adapted for commercial purposes.  Jules Cheret was among the first artists to treat lithography as a fine art medium, incorporating attractive colors into his images beginning in the late 1870s. He also introduced a new artistry to the designs, as witnessed by several posters here. Among them is a pair depicting dancing revelers, acrobats and musicians for the Folies Berg\u00e8re, the popular Parisian music hall catering to lewd and exotic tastes. It was the venue, in 1926, for Josephine Baker's famous ''banana dance,'' in which she performed topless wearing a skirt made of bananas.  By 1884, Cheret had designed almost 1,000 commercial posters, and, according to the exhibition catalog, ''was printing nearly 200,000 impressions annually.'' Following the 1881 ''revocation of censorship laws on printed materials,'' these color lithographic posters appeared on walls of buildings and kiosks throughout Paris, promoting theater, dance halls and music halls, as well as a new abundance of mass-produced consumer goods. They were intended to be catchy and instantly legible to potential consumers, hence their colorful intensity and bold graphic quality.  The following section of the exhibition presents a selection of lithographic advertising posters by various artists, among them Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis, Edouard Vuillard, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Alphonse Mucha and Jacques Villon, the elder brother of Marcel Duchamp. There are posters for gasoline, automobiles, magazines, journals, plays, arts expositions, housewares, sardines and all kinds of beverages, from wine and aperitifs to Champagne.  Many of these early posters employ imagery of flirtatious young women; even the gasoline poster features imagery of floating naked nymphs. It makes sense, for the figures in these posters are the personification of the desirable young woman for male audiences, the dominant consumers of the period. Even then, associating products with objects of male desire was a strategy to create desire for the product as well.  More generally, the posters are characterized by great artistic experimentation. Avant-garde modern artists delighted in the new art form, introducing an array of colors and subjects and playing with all kinds of dynamic designs. A good example is a Bonnard lithograph advertising Champagne, in which a young, frolicsome female, perhaps tipsy, is suddenly engulfed by a wave of Champagne bubbles spilling from her overfilled glass.  Toulouse-Lautrec was, however, the most innovative of the poster designers, with his Japonisme-inspired compositions (characterized by simplified figures and forms, planes of flat pure color and jolting diagonal lines), and his emphasis on subjects that had previously fallen outside the purview of fine art. There are more than a dozen of his posters here, including many famous ones of cabaret and circus performers, in addition to his more commercial work; among them are images of the dancers Jane Avril, May Milton and La Goulue, the stage name of Louise Weber.  The new, dynamic aesthetic of poster design occurring in Paris spread to other European cities, as the final two rooms of the exhibition seek to show. On display are several dozen examples of Belgian and Spanish modern posters, some from the collection of the Zimmerli, the rest on loan from private collections in Europe and the United States, many of them never before shown publicly. They add up to one more reason to visit this show, which is pure eye candy.

            "text": "  The Italian government said yesterday that police investigators had tracked down a rare group of first century B.C. marble panels that had been illegally excavated and offered to museums and private collectors. The 12 panels, a detail from one shown above, depict gladiators in combat and were found about two weeks ago in the garden of a private home 25 miles north of Rome, a government prosecutor, Paolo Ferri, said at a news conference. That the thieves did not succeed in selling them suggests that the market in ancient antiquities has largely dried up, he said. He credited Italy's tougher stance in dealing with those who loot antiquities, including prosecutions he has led recently in Rome, like the current trial of a former J. Paul Getty Museum curator. Mr. Ferri declined to give further details on the case, saying an investigation was under way; he did say that dealers already under investigation for such trafficking were involved. Anna Maria Moretti, a state superintendent for antiquities, said the panels would be on display at the National Etruscan Museum after they were restored.  ELISABETTA POVOLED  ",

            "text": "  IN 1955, a handful of mineral enthusiasts (O.K., call them rock geeks) from the Tucson Gem and Mineral Society got together to show off specimens from their personal collections at a local elementary school. From this small beginning, the annual Tucson Gem and Mineral Show has grown into the largest event of its kind in the country, a mega-celebration for rock lovers and a curiously mesmerizing attraction for spectators who don't know staurolite from Styrofoam. As many as 25,000 people are expected at this year's show Feb. 8 to 11 in the Tucson Convention Center.  More than 125 exhibits will have rocks and gems from private collectors and from museums including the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of Natural History in New York, the British Museum and the Mineralogical Museum at Harvard. There will be an opening reception, lectures, a micro-minerals room (where tiny crystals can be viewed through microscopes) and an educational ''mineral maze'' for children. And more than 300 vendors will hawk all sorts of mineral-related wares: piles of colorful gems and minerals, bits of meteorites, African beads, fossilized dinosaur dung (called coprolite), gold nuggets.  ''It's basically a giant museum exhibit that could never exist in an individual museum,'' said Peter Megaw, an organizer of the show. ''You're seeing stuff in one place that you'd normally have to log a lot of miles all over the world to see.''  The show draws mineralogy fanatics but also has a wider appeal. After all, as Ed Clark, the president of the Ventura Gem and Mineral Society in California, said, ''Who hasn't seen a neat rock and picked it up and wondered why it looks the way it does?''  As the Tucson show has grown, dozens of satellite shows have sprung up all over Tucson to get in on the action. Today they are grouped into a broad community event called the Tucson Gem, Mineral and Fossil Showcase, running Jan. 26 to Feb. 11 this year. ''I think if you had to pick one word to describe the whole scene, it would be 'overwhelming,' '' said Gene Meieran, an avid mineral collector who lives in Phoenix and will show off his collection of aquamarines (none for sale) in Tucson. ''Practically every hotel and gas station has made space for people to show and sell stuff. Even if you spent 24 hours going around, you could not possibly see everything there is to see.'' Of the ancillary events, he especially likes the Arizona Mineral and Fossil Show and the Westward Look Mineral Show. Both feature museum-quality items for sale.  Tucson has long been a mining center, but what made the Gem and Mineral Show take off in the early days was the participation of Paul E. Desautels, a curator of the Smithsonian's mineral museum, whose interest attracted other curators and collectors. Before long, the show was the gem and mineral event of the year.  The timing doesn't hurt either: the show is always in February, when Tucson has a distinct weather advantage.  Mineral shows take place all over the country -- Rock & Gem magazine posts a list at www.rockngem.com -- and several others are scheduled over the next few weeks. The Ventura society's show in Ventura, Calif., will include a demonstration of cutting stones into the rounded shapes called cabochons. In Gaithersburg, Md., new acquisitions by the Smithsonian Institution will be on display at the Montgomery County show. Jim Fowler, an artist specializing in wrapping gem stones in wire for jewelry, will demonstrate his skill at the GemStreet USA Show in Cincinnati. And in Spokane, Wash., a lucky door-prize winner will walk away with a 200-pound piece of petrified wood.  ''Going to shows is fun because you can learn so much about the world, and not only from the fossils and minerals,'' said Vanessa Galloway, a Web and graphic designer in Tucson who also has a business making and selling jewelry. ''There is so much cultural history surrounding antique beads, it's really interesting.''  But for most people, the shows are about buying objects that they find beautiful. And on that aspect, Ms. Galloway has a word of caution. ''You can spend every penny that your credit will allow,'' she said. ''So set a limit for yourself.''

            "text": "  To take the fullest pleasure in the exhibition of sculptures and video by the Spanish artist Sergio Prego at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, you must stand perfectly still and quiet in front of ''Black Monday'' (2006), a single-channel video of still life photographs of controlled fireworks explosions taken inside an abandoned factory in Bilbao, Spain (above). In all, the artist took more than a thousand photographs of 17 different explosions with 40 cameras. He then scanned them into a computer, cropped them and ran them together. He also composed what he calls ''a sequencing of sounds,'' a series of repeating ambient electronic noises that serve as the soundtrack. The results are a multifaceted representation of something that is usually invisible to the eye: explosion clouds immobilized in time and space, forming immensely beautiful sculptural shapes. It brings out the inner pyro in all of us. Sometimes these clouds even resemble dancing figures. It is as if you were looking at a three-dimensional sculpture in video, though a few frames later, the form magically evaporates. The video lasts only three and a half minutes, which gives you just enough time to get hooked before it starts all over again. It is like stepping into another dimension.

Given that this sort of thing is so rarely on display at the museum, it was even more surprising to discover that some of the art comes from the museum's own collection. This is a terrific show, perhaps one of the best to be staged at the museum in some time.  Nancy Stula, the curator, has assembled an engaging selection of early, confrontational feminist work with more recent, varied offerings by female artists. The contrasts of tone and subject matter between the two groups, spilling across two levels of the building, help illustrate just how far female artists have come.  The title of the exhibition suggests the idea of women who are raw, tough or brutal. But it is more of a metaphor than anything else, characterizing artists who -- one way or another -- have sought to challenge the historically marginalized position of women. ''With the youngest of the artists in this exhibition born in 1959,'' Sherry Buckberrough, an art historian, writes in the show's catalog, ''all came of age while the status of women in the art world was still strongly contested.''  The early years of feminism saw female artists embrace numerous strategies to combat art world sexism and discrimination. One popular approach was to reclaim women's creative histories by adopting materials and art-making practices once commonly, and pejoratively, associated with femininity -- needlework, weaving, pottery, printmaking, to name a few. Among the many artists who took up this challenge was Miriam Schapiro, represented here by an ebullient circular collage that draws on patterning and textile traditions.  The design of Ms. Schapiro's concentric, centralizing composition alludes to women's genitals, which points to another visual strategy adopted by female artists: an empowering use of sexual imagery and depictions of the female body. Before the early 20th century, women were largely excluded from art academies, and even when they were allowed in, they weren't allowed to study nude models. Men, in this way, maintained a virtual monopoly on their depiction.  Caricature and satire were also important tools for early feminist artists. May Stevens's ''Study for print 'Big Daddy' '' (1969) is an early drawing for her ''Big Daddy'' series of paintings depicting a thick-necked nude man with a slobbering bulldog sitting on his lap. The figure, whom the artist called ''big daddy,'' is a cartoonlike personification of male authority and of United States militarism during the Vietnam War era; the paintings are some of the most famous works of early American feminist art.  The tradition of feminist satire is carried on in the work of Alison Saar, who is represented by a color woodcut, ''Sweeping Beauty'' (1997), depicting an upside-down image of a naked woman with hair like a broom head. It is a caricature of the domestic chores commonly ascribed to women, with the figure mirroring the crucified Christ in religious paintings.  Artists like Nancy Spero, Lynda Benglis and June Wayne, who were involved in the feminist art movement from its early days, also have work exhibited here, but it concerns other issues. Ms. Wayne, a master printmaker, is represented in the show by some ''exploratory images of interstellar space,'' as Ms. Buckberrough writes in the catalog, but which are really formal explorations of the printmaking medium.  Angry social and political protests about gender are largely a thing of the past. The new wave of female artists are working on issues and concerns similar to those of their male counterparts. Among them is Ellen Carey, a photographer who creates startling abstract colored Polaroid images using random developing emulsion flows. The images depart from standard photographic traditions in much the same way that the work of her feminist predecessors departed from art history.

            "text": "  For four decades, John Hechinger ran a hardware and home supplies chain founded by his father in 1911. In 1978, as part of an expansion, he moved the corporate headquarters to suburban Washington, D.C. Soon after, he began collecting art to humanize the somewhat sterile building. Believing in the relationship between the tools his company made and the work that artists produced, he hoped the art would inspire his workers.  Mr. Hechinger died in 2004, but the collection he established has continued to grow through acquisitions overseen by International Arts & Artists, a Washington-based traveling exhibition service that was given control of the collection after his death.  Touring nationally since 2001, ''Tools as Art: The Hechinger Collection'' has touched down at the Katonah Museum of Art, filling the museum's main exhibition galleries with 64 works by almost as many artists. It is surprisingly poetic, optimistic and intriguing.  Tools have a small but appreciable place in art history, mostly in the context of labor imagery. Prehistoric cave paintings in France and Spain have schematic diagrams of primitive implements, evidence of the first stirrings of human tool making, and scenes of peasants working the soil are found throughout ancient art. Farming returned as a popular theme in art, beginning with medieval paintings and prayer books, like the Book of Hours, and continuing on through the 19th century.  But it was not really until the 20th century that tools became the subject of artworks. As Sarah Tanguy, curator of the Hechinger collection, points out in the exhibition catalog, depicting tools became for artists a ''means to bridge the gap between art and life, and to address the shifting definition of perception.'' She is right, though it may also have had something to do with questioning the traditional artistic process as an act of creation, an act of making.  Art critics do not talk much about craftsmanship these days, preferring to dwell on ideas or the clever statements an artist seeks to convey. This is largely because of Marcel Duchamp, who was probably the first artist to make an artwork out of real tools. With his ready-mades, beginning in 1914-15, he claimed the right of anyone to become an artist by choosing an object and putting it in a gallery. Among his early ready-mades was a snow shovel.  Several artists in this exhibition share Duchamp's anarchic values, like Arman, the late French artist who made sculptures using mass-produced tools like wrenches, handsaws, pliers and paintbrushes. (He is also known for his public-destruction artworks, like dynamiting a sports car.) Shown here is ''Blue, Red, Brown'' (1988), something between a painting and a collage -- thick stripes of paint end in paintbrushes, stuck to the canvas.  Similarly, Tracy Heneberger uses hardware-store materials like hinges to concoct adorably original, elegantly constructed sculptures, and the Chicago-based, self-taught artist known only as Mr. Imagination makes shadowy, masklike portraits using paintbrushes and found materials. There is something very African about the paintbrush portraits, though the artist's sources of inspiration include Christianity, world affairs, politics and popular culture.  In addition to paintbrushes and hammers, saw blades are popular, both as subject and material for artists. Ken Butler and Donald Lipski employ saw blades in assemblage sculptures that tend toward minimalism. Several artists also use the blades as a painting surface, including Jacob J. Kass, Howard Finster, Lou Horner, Oleg Kudryashov, Rico Solinas, Wim Delvoye and John Schlesinger. Others make replicas of handsaws out of paper and wood.  Mr. Finster, who was born in Alabama in 1916 and died in 2001, was one of America's best-known folk artists. The exhibition catalog tells us that he experienced visions from an early age and was later to become a revivalist Baptist preacher. He ''heard the call'' to paint ''sacred art'' only in 1976, subsequently cranking out crudely evangelical paintings and sculptures, commonly linking words and images. Shown here is a painted Stanley handsaw from 1990, dealing with the history of tools.  There are also older, historical works of art, including a lush black-and-white photograph of a New York hardware store, a sign in the front window advertising a sale on tools. Berenice Abbott took the photograph in 1938 as part of a government-sponsored project to document the city and its inhabitants. It makes for a splendid period piece, the store's owner having lined the window and pavement outside the store with all manner of items and implements.  If Abbott sought to convey a wealth of detail about the subjects she documented, Walker Evans, her contemporary, was interested in economical, precise images that conveyed elegance, simplicity and restraint. So it is with ''Wrench'' (1955), part of a series of photographs titled ''Beauties of the Common Tool'' that was originally published in Fortune magazine. It is a chilly, no-fuss, front-on portrait, the tool stripped and reduced to its bare essentials.  Evans introduced this series of photographs on the beauties of the common tool to readers of Fortune with a brief essay, in which he stated what Mr. Hechinger seemed to know all along: ''Almost all basic small tools stand, aesthetically speaking, for elegance, candor and purity.''

            "text": "  Neo-Splendor In American Wing  As the Metropolitan Museum nears the spring opening of its ambitious new Greek and Roman galleries, a more modest project is quietly taking shape on the opposite side of the museum, in its American Wing. The first phase -- the new neo-Classical galleries of American art on the wing's first floor -- opens Tuesday.  ''We've been in this building for more than 25 years, so it's been a full generation,'' said Morrison Heckscher, chairman of the Met's American Wing. ''Now it's time to rethink, upgrade and improve the facilities and the way we show the collection.''  One of the most drastic changes, which has yet to be installed, will be a large glass elevator. In addition the entire layout of the wing has been rethought, better to show off the collections, which include the famed period rooms spanning two centuries. An 18th-century room in the Dutch tradition from the Winne House outside Albany will be added.  The Met's decorative arts collection will have a more extensive display, and the American paintings galleries will also be renovated, expanded and totally reordered on one level instead of two. Even the famed Charles Engelhard Court will be refurbished to give its sculpture, stained-glass windows and architectural elements greater prominence. The entire project is expected to be completed by 2010.  For now visitors will be able to see the neo-Classical galleries of American art from 1810 to 1840. The setting reflects American Classical architecture and includes details from Colonnade Row on Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan -- ''the grandest row houses of the period,'' Mr. Heckscher said.  For a Gift, Three's Company  Ten years ago the San Francisco collectors Richard and Pamela Kramlich established the New Art Trust, a nonprofit foundation to promote the collecting, care and exhibition of media art. It was started to help the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where the Kramlichs are trustees, but in 2002 it branched out to include the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate in London.  Now the couple have given the trust 21 works by artists including Bruce Nauman, Nam June Paik, Bill Viola, Matthew Barney and Doug Aitken, to be shared by the three museums.  ''The trust was set up early on with the understanding that the ownership of media art is very different from that of painting and sculptures,'' said Neal Benezra, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Museums won't be showing these works constantly, so sharing them makes sense.  ''It's also a way of creating an interesting new alliance between European, East Coast and West Coast institutions,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern in New York. ''This is a remarkable body of material that would have been impossible to have assembled today.''  Price and rarity have made such works particularly difficult to collect. Most important, said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, the sharing arrangement enables the works to go on public view far more than they would be otherwise. ''It gives the public more access,'' he said. ''From the point of view of the visitor, it doesn't make any difference who owns the works.''  A Russian Favorite  A portrait of a bohemian-looking man in a dark jacket and a bright red scarf by the Lithuanian-born Expressionist painter Chaim Soutine is the cover image of Sotheby's catalog for its Feb. 5 sale of Impressionist and modern art in London. The choice is fitting not because portraits have become particularly popular at auction, but because Russian collectors love Soutine and London is the place where many Russian billionaires live and where others go to shop.  ''Man With a Red Scarf'' (about 1921) is being sold by Dorothy Cherry. Her husband, Wendell Cherry, was the president and chief executive of Humana, the hospital management corporation based in Louisville, Ky. He died in 1991.  Ms. Cherry bought the Soutine 10 years ago at Christie's in London for $1.6 million, then a record for that artist. ''The art world thought I was nuts,'' she recalled. ''I never asked anyone's opinion. It was the greatest Soutine I'd ever seen for sale.'' Sotheby's now expects the painting to bring $5.9 million to $9.8 million.  Ms. Cherry said the strength of the art market, and particularly the Russian market, made her decide to sell. ''It just seemed like the right time,'' she said.  Both she and her husband sold paintings at Sotheby's over the years for high prices. In 1989, at another high point in the market, they sold ''Yo Picasso,'' the Blue Period self-portrait from 1901, for $47.9 million to the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos.  ''I hung the Soutine in the same place I hung 'Yo Picasso,' '' Ms. Cherry said, speaking of her house in Louisville. The similarities were striking: both were portraits of men with bright red scarves.  ''I think Soutine is underrated,'' she said. ''To me he's one of the great artists. I used to think he was the poor man's Picasso, but not anymore.''  Hello, Minneapolis  Peter Eleey, curator and producer for Creative Time in Manhattan, has been named a visual arts curator at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. He replaces Douglas Fogle, who left the Walker for the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. Mr. Eleey starts at the Walker in March.  Nato Thompson, a curator at Mass MoCA in North Adams, Mass., will replace him. Mr. Thompson will be joining Mark Beasley, who was an independent curator, writer and artist working in London before he joined Creative Time last month as a curator and producer.  Inside Art  ",

            "text": "  Wilson Hulme, an energetic promoter of the stamp collecting hobby and philatelic curator of the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum in Washington, died on Wednesday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 60.  The cause was a heart attack, said Allison Gallaway, a spokeswoman for the museum.  A stamp collector since childhood, Mr. Hulme accepted in 2002 what he called his dream job as curator of the philatelic collections of the postal museum, which focuses on the history of mail delivery and the importance of the postal system in American history. Before that, Mr. Hulme's business career included long stays at Frito-Lay and Unilever, and he was vice-president of operations at Nabisco from 1997 to 2001.  Until Mr. Hulme's arrival, the museum's stamp collections had languished, largely locked away out of visitors' sight. With his mantra, ''Access the inaccessible,'' Mr. Hulme, who was a serious student of philately as well as a collector, quickly set about trying to broaden the appeal of stamp collecting.  He made the stamp holdings, including major rarities, easier to visit. He arranged for specimens from the royal collection of Queen Elizabeth II to be exhibited there, in a rare showing outside Britain, and he got the Smithsonian to buy John Lennon's boyhood stamp album, hoping the acquisition would help inspire new collectors.  ''He knew there was something in the hobby for everyone, and he opened the doors,'' said Ms. Gallaway, the museum spokeswoman. ''I would always say to him, 'Tell me why anyone should care,' and he always would.''  Although he was born in Dallas, Mr. Hulme grew up in Ardmore, Okla., and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1968. He earned a master's degree from Michigan State University in 1969 and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1978. He retired from the Navy with the rank of captain.  Mr. Hulme was a member of numerous philatelic clubs and societies in the United States and abroad, including the Collectors Club of New York and the Royal Philatelic Society, London, and was president of the United States Philatelic Classics Society at the time of his death.  He is survived by his wife of 34 years, the former Susan Thimlar, with whom he lived in Morristown, N.J.; his mother, Anna Ruth Hulme-Shedd of Ardmore; a sister, Barbara Everheart of Dallas; and a brother, Ron Hulme of Houston.

            "text": "  Robert Noortman, a gregarious, risk-taking dealer who was a major force in the market for old master and French Impressionist paintings, died on Sunday at his castle in the Belgian countryside, just over the border from his base in Maastricht, the Netherlands. He was 60.  Caldwell Douglas, the London publicist who represented his gallery in Maastricht, said that Mr. Noortman had been suffering from pancreatic cancer but had died of a heart attack.  A competitive dealer who was often seen bidding steadily at auctions in New York and London while chomping on an unlit cigar, Mr. Noortman made headlines in December 2000 when he paid $28.6 million for Rembrandt's 1632 ''Portrait of a Lady, Aged 62,'' at Christie's in London. It was a record price for a Rembrandt.  Three months later, he exhibited it at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht with an asking price of $36.5 million; it was eventually sold to a collector in the United States for an undisclosed price.  In January 2001 he snapped up Rembrandt's 1633 ''Portrait of a Bearded Man, Bust Length in a Red Doublet'' for $12.6 million at Christie's in New York. Last year he offered it at the European Fine Art Fair for $32.4 million but did not make a sale. Though a wily negotiator, he stunned the art world last June by selling his business, Noortman Master Paintings, for $56.5 million to Sotheby's. Under the terms of the deal, the auction house assumed about $26 million of debt from the gallery and Mr. Noortman received about 3.2 percent of Sotheby's stock. He also became a member of Sotheby's international advisory board.  In a statement, Sotheby's said this week that the gallery would survive under the leadership of Mr. Noortman's son William and Jeanette Gerritsma, the longtime gallery manager of Noortman Master Paintings. Sotheby's said it was assessing what impact Mr. Noortman's death would have on the gallery's finances.  The son of a policeman, Mr. Noortman was born on March 5, 1946, in Heemstede, the Netherlands. After leaving school at 16, he often recounted, he managed to talk his way into a series of odd jobs, selling everything from refrigerators to cars.  He opened his first gallery in Hulsberg, near Maastricht, in 1968. In 1975 he helped found Pictura, the forerunner to the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, and was chairman of the latter for a decade. He was also a philanthropist, supporting the Rijksmuseum and Mauritshuis in the Netherlands as well as the National Gallery in London, where there is a Noortman Room of Dutch cabinet paintings.  Beyond his passion for art, he was a licensed pilot and in 1989 was cited in the Guinness Book of Records for flying into and out of 12 European Community countries in one day.  Mr. Noortman is survived by his third wife, Angelique, and seven children.  ",

            "text": "  Independence At the Hammer  After six years of negotiations, the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center in Los Angeles is about to declare its independence from one of its governing bodies, the Hammer Foundation, which over the years had accused the museum of being in breach of its founding agreement.  Since its inception in 1989, the museum has had to operate under certain restrictions imposed by the foundation and its founder, Armand Hammer, the Occidental Petroleum chairman and owner of the Hammer Galleries in New York, who died in 1990. These are some of the rules the museum has seen as hamstringing its operation:  It has always had to have on view at least 140 works of art from the 195 in the Armand Hammer collection, many of which are considered by experts to be not of museum quality, and at least one gallery has had to be dedicated to them.  It has had to use its full name -- the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center -- rather than simply the Hammer Museum.  A bust of Hammer has had to be on view in the lobby.  Perhaps most chafing to the museum, a clause in its governing agreement stated that if the museum failed to follow any of these rules, the art -- as well as the income it receives from the sale of Leonardo's Codex Leicester to Bill Gates for $30.8 million in 1994 -- could be seized by the foundation, and the building and its endowment could be returned to Occidental Petroleum.  ''The restriction was very onerous and bringing the institution down,'' said John Walsh, director emeritus of the J. Paul Getty Museum, who has been advising the museum.  Now it has struck a deal with the Hammer Foundation, run by Michael A. Hammer, the founder's grandson, who has also served as a museum trustee. The agreement, which takes effect as soon as all the parties have signed off, amends many of these restrictions.  The foundation will no longer be involved in museum governance. Mr. Hammer will resign from the board, although he will remain an honorary trustee. The museum will continue to be managed by the University of California, Los Angeles, which has run it since 1994.  Perhaps as important, the museum is returning to the foundation 92 works, valued at about $55 million, from the collection. They include examples by artists including Bellows, C\u00e9zanne, Degas and van Gogh.  The Hammer collection consists of works from the 16th through 20th centuries by European artists like Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, C\u00e9zanne, Rubens, as well as Americans like Sargent and Cassatt. Two years ago Christie's estimated its worth at $305 million. Visitors will still see the best of the collection, including paintings by Rembrandt, van Gogh and Sargent.  The museum has needed two galleries to show the required 140 works properly; with fewer works on display and the freedom to show them as it pleases, it says that more room will be available for special exhibitions and other art, like the Hammer contemporary collection. ''The issue was what were really museum-worthy paintings and which shouldn't have been in the Hammer in the first place,'' said Mr. Walsh, who advised the museum on what to keep.  Since Hammer was a gallery owner, many works in the collection were stock that he bought cheaply to sell at a profit. They were never intended for a museum.  ''This is a happy ending to a very difficult situation,'' said Ann Philbin, director of the Hammer since 1999.  Bilbao Bound  The Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain, designed by Frank Gehry and nearing its 10th anniversary in October, has made several significant acquisitions since Richard Serra's room-size installation went on view in June 2005. It has commissioned ''Tulips,'' a sculpture of color-coated stainless- steel tulip-shape balloons from Jeff Koons's ''Celebration'' series. The museum also invited Daniel Buren, Christina Iglesias, Jenny Holzer and Liam Gillick to propose site-specific works for La Salve Bridge, which intersects the museum; Mr. Buren's work was chosen to be executed.  Now it has purchased ''Discourse on Commodus,'' Cy Twombly's first historical series, from 1963. Composed of nine canvases, the work was first shown at the Castelli Gallery in Manhattan, where it received unfavorable reviews and went unsold. The only other time it has been on view was in an exhibition of Mr. Twombly's work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1979.  The series, created while Mr. Twombly was living in Rome, chronicles the decline of the Roman Empire as personified by the emperor Commodus. When the dealer Leo Castelli couldn't sell the work, he returned it to Mr. Twombly, who sold it to a private collector in Rome. A few months ago the collector sold it to Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer, who sold it to the Guggenheim Bilbao.  ''Cy Twombly is very much a bridge figure between Europe and America,'' said Lisa Dennison, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. ''He embodies what the museum stands for.''  The Bilbao region's Basque government, which covers the museum's operating costs and pays for its acquisitions, has spent $35 million on the most recent three works.  Sotheby's Raises Fee  As if buying at auction weren't expensive enough, Sotheby's has quietly raised its buyer's premium yet again. Two years ago it increased the fee to 20 percent of the first $200,000 of the hammer price from 20 percent of the first $100,000. As in the past, it charged 12 percent on any amount over that.  But ever since it began giving sellers a percentage of the premium over the last few years, its profits have eroded. So it decided to raise the charge to 20 percent of the hammer price of the first $500,000 and 12 percent of the rest.  Will the company's archrival, Christie's, follow? ''We are certainly going to consider it,'' said Marc Porter, president of Christie's.  Inside Art  ",

            "text": "  The civic leaders of Westchester communities suffering from economic decline may want to look to the Bronx, where the opening of the Longwood Arts Project in the abandoned Public School 39 in 1981 drew artists to the area and paved the way, in the 1990s, for the neighborhood's renaissance.  These days, the Bronx is home to a large concentration of artists, attracted by the affordable housing and a supportive cultural scene.  ''South Bronx Contemporary,'' at the Longwood Art Gallery, celebrates some of this talent, past and present. It is four shows in one. Three past directors of this nonprofit space -- Fred Wilson, Betti-Sue Hertz and Eddie Torres -- have teamed up with the current director, Edwin Ramoran, in curating four shows for the gallery's 25th anniversary. As a community-based art center, Longwood Art Gallery has a mission to support emerging artists from underrepresented groups. This is partly reflected in these new shows, which play up one of the borough's best-known assets: its dizzying ethnic diversity. The artists in the exhibitions are natives of more than a dozen countries.  Though organized separately, the four shows, which feature works by more than 60 artists, hang together well. There is a certain uniformity of style and tone to the artworks that each of the curators have selected. Much of the work is conceptually oriented, and each show contains examples dealing with cultural differences, politics and performance.  The largest exhibition is ''Everyday Is Like Sunday.'' Organized by Mr. Ramoran, it includes work by a grab-bag, intergenerational group of artists living and working in the Bronx. Mr. Ramoran has also tried to include not only established artists, but also other, lesser-known players, among them amateur artists chosen through an open call, studio visits and recommendations.  Among the participants who didn't train formally as artists is Sumathy Sundarababu, who works in the medical field and was inspired to take up oil painting by the popular PBS series ''The Joy of Painting,'' with Bob Ross, a popular television host who died in 1995, a few years after the show stopped taping. Like many of Mr. Ross's devotees, Ms. Sundarababu paints trite, happy landscapes with willowy trees and an aging farmhouse, among other features. She has never shown her art publicly before this exhibition.  Then there are artists who blur boundaries between professionals and hobbyists. Among them is Ernie Woo, who went to art school but decided to work outside the gallery and market systems by making art on commission. Mr. Ramoran saw him painting T-shirts on 161st Street, by Yankee Stadium, and invited him to participate in the show. The T-shirt Mr. Woo is exhibiting here has a painted skull and bats, crossed like bones, with a Yankees cap -- a reference to the Yankees' proposal to take public land to build a new stadium.  Other artists are working professionals, but just aren't shown much since they are not plugged into the art gallery system or are too busy working to make a living. This goes for many of the painters here, from Ptah Miller, Diane Davis, Isaac Garcia-Lanzo and Wilda Gonzalez to Francisco Vallejo and Eilis Soto. Most of them do portraiture, in particular, figures within nature.  Mr. Ramoran envisioned his exhibition as a professional development project, promoting and encouraging artists who might not ordinarily be invited to exhibit in a mainstream gallery or museum. This is largely how Longwood Arts Project was originally conceived. Mr. Wilson, the gallery's first director and now a successful artist, also takes up the cause, organizing a show of the work of artists dealing with the concept of blackness and black identity.  Mr. Wilson's exhibition, in the back room, is titled ''Black Now,'' and takes its cues from discussions of black identity since the late 1990s, asking what it means to talk about ''blackness'' now. His response is joking and mystifying, for he has juxtaposed works that deal directly with the African-American experience with others that use the color black or have the word black in their titles.  The upshot is an engaging, if on occasion glib exhibition that riffs on the elusive concept of blackness. Exhibits range from one of Kara Walker's earnest off-set prints of slaves silhouetted against a Civil War-era landscape, to Rashawn Griffin's video performance of a figure, dressed in an outfit made of puffed-up black garbage bags, picking flowers in a field. He looks ridiculous.  The other two exhibitions are smaller, more tightly focused. One, titled ''Iconoclasmic,'' features works by artists who use pop-culture images and materials like nail polish, rhinestones, comics and advertisements. The other, and the more interesting of the two, is ''Street Disturbance.'' Organized by Ms. Hertz, it consists of works by an artist and those of two artist collectives, which work in the public domain and use humor and agitprop to address social and political issues. It consists mostly of videos, accompanied by photographic and text documentation.  ''Street Disturbance'' is the kind of exhibition one expects from a young, alternative space like Longwood. It is irreverent and provocative. One of the collectives -- Surveillance Camera Players, formed in 1996 -- draws attention to all kinds of invisible social control, most commonly by performing skits in front of security cameras at various public sites, including subways and street corners; a video of a 1998 skit is shown here.  It is great to see that a counterculture is alive and kicking.  ''South Bronx Contemporary,'' Longwood Art Gallery, 450 Grand Concourse, the Bronx, through March 10.

            "text": "  THE new exhibition at the Conrad L. Mallett Art Gallery at Capitol Community College differs from other exhibitions in at least one respect: touching the art is allowed, even encouraged.  ''We're thinking of having the guards here say: 'Yes! You can touch,' '' said Pedro Valentin, the college's art instructor and the exhibition's curator.  But there is another difference: this exhibition showcases the work of several Connecticut artists who are blind. In particular, it displays the art of David Waite of Mansfield, who lost his sight over eight days in 1997 from a combination of diabetes and Graves' disease.  Mr. Waite, who had been a pen-and-ink artist, was working as a courtroom sketch artist for WFSB-TV, Channel 3, in Hartford at the time. He had to give up his job and initially did not know what to do with himself, until one day a friend suggested that he try working with clay. With that, Mr. Waite became a sculptor.  ''If a picture is worth a thousand words, these works have to be worth a thousand feelings,'' Mr. Waite said recently, as he stood among several of his sculptures at the exhibition. ''I use no tools. I use my fingers, and it flows.''  His work, and the work of other Connecticut artists who are blind or whose sight is impaired, will be on display through Jan. 31. The exhibition is easy to see through the front windows of the college, which moved four years ago to a building on Main Street that once housed G. Fox & Company, at one time Hartford's largest department store. The building's transformation into a school included the restoration of its large storefront windows. What passers-by see are Mr. Waite's anatomically realistic depictions of a chief of an American Indian tribe, an escaped slave, the biblical Moses, a mother grieving for a child lost to war, and the infant Jesus and the Virgin Mary.  ''You really work by faith rather than by sight,'' Mr. Valentin said to Mr. Waite.  Also clearly visible inside and out are drawings and mixed-media works from students throughout the state. These include a plate that has been made into the likeness of a human face, and an ethereal pencil drawing of angels, both created by Pamela Cintron Mejias, an 8-year-old fourth grader at the Samuel Huntington School in Norwich; pottery shaped by Ayesha Ali, a 12-year-old seventh-grader at Newtown Middle School in Newtown; and a mixed-media work by Ashley Dixon, 19, a student at ACES Whitney High School East in Hamden.  ''We are always trying to promote Connecticut artists here, especially those least represented,'' said Mr. Valentin, who is also a painter and illustrator.  Free admission. Hours: 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. or by appointment. An artists' reception will be held from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 25; 950 Main Street, Hartford.  THE WEEK  Correction:  January 28, 2007, Sunday  An article last Sunday about an exhibition by blind artists misspelled part of the name of the college in Hartford where it is being held. It is Capital Community College, not Capitol.  ",

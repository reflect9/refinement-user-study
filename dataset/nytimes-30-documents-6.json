In a statement, the officials said the power line would ''have a severe negative impact on vital neighborhood services and residents' overall quality of life'' and identified an alternative route that they said would be less disruptive. Michael S. Clendenin, a Con Ed spokesman, said that the line was essential to expand the capacity of the networks serving the area and that the proposed route was the most feasible. The State Public Service Commission is expected to decide the issue shortly.  SEWELL CHAN  ",

            "text": "  The New Jersey Legislature is considering a bill that would extend the benefits of the Highlands preservation legislation to cities and municipalities throughout the state.  Assemblywoman Linda R. Greenstein, a deputy speaker and sponsor of the bill, said it would use transfer of development rights, in which developers buy credits from property owners whose land is being preserved. The developers can use the credits in other areas of the state where growth is either needed or is deemed acceptable.  The municipalities that accept the growth can charge impact fees of $15,000 per new housing unit to finance schools and utility projects.  The plan has been in effect in the Highlands area, in the northern part of the state, and in areas around the Pinelands for several years, but this measure would include the entire state, said Ms. Greenstein, a Democrat from Monroe.  The bill is under committee review but has already received support from Gov. Jon S. Corzine and the State Department of Environmental Protection, which wrote much of it.  ''The more I learn about it, the more I see it has a lot of advantages,'' Ms. Greenstein said. ''Anything that takes development out of areas that has too much and places it where it is needed is a good idea.''  JOHN HOLL  THE WEEK  ",

            "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''The George Pataki Era'' (editorial, Dec. 31): In Gov. George E. Pataki's first budget, he cut state school aid to New York City while increasing it for the rest of the state, leading to a drastic cutback in the city's public school spending at a moment that enrollment was rising.  In 1997, he pushed through his School Tax Relief program, known as STAR, which directed rising state aid to the affluent suburban districts that spend the most, raising the average state aid per student in the affluent downstate suburban counties to almost as high as in New York City. In exchange for STAR, he promised city legislators a state bond referendum to fix the city's aging schools -- a bond issue that was later defeated.  Nothing else Mr. Pataki has done has had as great an impact on as many people. Elsewhere in the country, those living in districts with larger tax bases and less needy students face a state education aid system that redistributes their state taxes to less well-off districts.  Only Mr. Pataki could successfully achieve a state education aid system that redistributes education resources away from New York City, home of a majority of the state's neediest children. This is his true legacy.  Larry Littlefield  Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn  ",

            "text": "  Among its many capital improvement projects, New Jersey Transit is considering introducing a train line that would run from Manhattan and Hoboken to Scranton, Pa., along the Route 80 corridor.  Called the Lackawanna Cutoff, the proposed line is an 88-mile stretch of level ground that was once used by the Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad and later by Conrail, which abandoned its right of way more than two decades ago and removed the tracks. New Jersey Transit bought the land in 2001.  ''We're advancing this project, including public meetings this month,'' said Joe Dee, a New Jersey Transit spokesman. The plan has a projected cost of $551 million, not including the purchase of property for stations. An environmental assessment and conceptual design are due this year.  The Lackawanna Cutoff line would employ diesel-powered trains and have stops in Andover and Blairstown in New Jersey and Analomink, the Delaware Water Gap, East Stroudsburg, Pocono Mountain, Scranton and Tobyhanna in Pennsylvania.  It is not clear when service could begin. ''A timeline for future phases of the project will be contingent on funding availability,'' Mr. Dee said.  Mr. Dee said that the departure of George D. Warrington, who has said he is stepping down as executive director of New Jersey Transit at the end of March, would have no effect on the Lackawanna Cutoff project.  JOHN HOLL  THE WEEK  ",

            "text": "  The proposed New Jersey to Manhattan commuter rail tunnel, widely regarded as vital to the economy of both New York and New Jersey, is moving into a critical period that could decide whether or not it actually gets built.  Largely because of the efforts of New Jersey Transit director George Warrington, who has announced his intention to step down at the end of March, the massive project has blossomed beyond being merely a dream of transportation planners and New Jersey cheerleaders. Officials in New York now support it and want to start construction in 2009.  And just this month, a key federal agency approved a draft of the tunnel's environmental impact statement, an essential step for getting federal funds.  But there are major hurdles to surmount during the next two years. The deficit-plagued federal government will have to come up with up to half of the $7.2 billion estimated cost. And even though the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has pledged $2 billion, New Jersey, which has its own budget problems, may have to come up with more than the $500-million it has promised. And even that may not be enough.  Since Mr. Warrington will not be around to keep the pressure on, there's a risk that some of this necessary funding may dry up or that other smaller, less important pet projects of various politicians may drain off money. It is imperative that New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, a strong supporter of the tunnel, name a successor with the same expertise and sense of commitment that Mr. Warrington has displayed.  The need for the tunnel is enormous. Currently, a 96-year-old Amtrak-owned tunnel with two tracks is the only rail link under the Hudson River. Serving both Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains, the link carries 45,000 passengers each peak period when 24 trains an hour are squeezed through the tunnel. If there is a breakdown, rail transportation between New Jersey and Manhattan stops. The new tunnel, which would end under 34th Street on Manhattan's West Side, would provide essential backup and double the number of trains that could enter and exit Manhattan from New Jersey.  Besides improved service for commuters from west of the Hudson, the new tunnel is essential for New York City's economy, which is expected to become increasingly dependent on workers from New Jersey, Rockland and Orange counties in New York, and even Pennsylvania, as the years go by.  It is this argument that Mr. Warrington used to get Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Charles Schumer and other key New York city and state officials behind the project.  And it is this argument, together with the importance of a healthy New York-New Jersey metropolitan area to the economy of the entire nation, that Mr. Warrington's successor will have to make in Washington to get the needed federal money.  For the tunnel to become a reality, New Jersey Transit will need one of the most able and persuasive mass transit directors in the country.  New Jersey  ",

            "text": "  Gov. Eliot Spitzer poached one of Pennsylvania's top economic development officials on Monday to give him a similar job in New York as part of Mr. Spitzer's effort to rebuild western New York's stagnant economy.  The official, Daniel Gundersen, 46, was named the upstate co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, a $160,000-a-year post. He has been executive deputy secretary of Pennsylvania's Department of Community and Economic Development since 2003 -- essentially serving as the department secretary's top deputy. He has also worked in economic development for Maryland and for Philadelphia.  Mr. Spitzer has said repeatedly that revitalizing the faltering upstate economy will be a major priority of his administration, and to that end he has split the top management of the Empire State Development Corporation, creating co-chairmen for upstate and downstate. Mr. Gundersen will run an office based in Buffalo while Patrick J. Foye, the acting downstate chairman, will also have authority over the Albany region and the Hudson Valley.  Mr. Spitzer also continued his practice of appointing former colleagues at the attorney general's office to prominent roles. He named Ken Schoetz, who has been an assistant attorney general in charge of the Buffalo Regional Office, to be the chief operating officer of the development corporation upstate. Mr. Schoetz, whose job will pay $150,000, has also been one of the state's representatives on the Peace Bridge Authority.  ''Dan Gundersen brings tremendous economic development experience to New York State,'' the governor said in a statement. ''Paired with Ken Schoetz, we have the right team in place to bring much needed energy and focus to upstate economic development through the newly created Upstate E.S.D.C. headquarters.''  Reviving the battered economy of the Buffalo region, which has suffered from a loss of automotive and other manufacturing jobs, will be no small feat.  In an interview, Mr. Gundersen said that, among other things, he wanted to identify companies that were growing in the region and make it a priority to keep them in the state.  ''There are fast-growing companies in every region of every state,'' he said. ''If you don't focus on the important issues to them, they're the most likely to relocate to regions that can sustain their growth.''  The management of the development corporation was often criticized under former Gov. George E. Pataki, who appointed as chairman his fund-raiser and close ally, Charles A. Gargano, and then used the agency's borrowing authority to finance billions of dollars for special projects at the governor's discretion or the discretion of the Republican-led Senate.  ",

The office said it expected deficits of $2.9 billion in fiscal 2009 and $2.7 billion in fiscal 2010, the last year of Mayor Michael R.

If ever there were a worse proposal for the region, it escapes me. The only reason such a proposal is even surfacing is the paucity of decent train service in New York State. Mr. Sullivan doesn't even acknowledge the need to upgrade the railroads in the area. If we had fast, convenient and reliable train service between New York and Chicago and other Eastern cities, there would not even be the need to expand Stewart.  Mr. Sullivan also does not mention the need for public transportation in the immediate region. The overwhelmed parking lots at the Poughkeepsie train station and others up and down the valley attest to the absence of such a service. Until attention is paid to these essential requirements for ''smart development,'' expansion of any aspect of such development will be detrimental to the fundamental health of the region.  Carol H.

            "text": "  Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday that his office would review thousands of individual grants known as ''member items,'' the spending Albany lawmakers doled out for pet projects last year, staking out a potentially vast new front in efforts to reform the ways of the state capital.  And moving to confront corruption in the upper echelons of state government, Mr. Cuomo also said he would promote the chief of his office's public integrity unit to special deputy attorney general, and promised a significant increase in the unit's staffing and resources.  In a brief but pointed speech here Thursday at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, Mr. Cuomo assailed the member-item spending as ''a visible, graphic illustration'' of the profligacy, secrecy and dysfunction that have characterized state government and dismayed voters in recent years.  Last month, federal prosecutors accused State Senator Efrain Gonz\u00e1lez Jr., a Bronx Democrat, of stealing more than $400,000 in state money appropriated for charities in his district and using it for personal expenses. Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, is facing a federal investigation into some $500,000 in state grants he directed to Evident Technologies, a profit-making technology company in which a close friend of his was an investor.  Mr. Cuomo said that his office would review more than 6,000 member items that were approved last year to ensure that they met legal requirements for the spending of taxpayer money, and move to recover any state funds that were spent inappropriately. All future member items will face the same review, he said.  Taking a cue from Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who has also made ethics reform the top priority for his term, Mr. Cuomo cast his effort as the Statehouse version of the financial-services prosecutions that made Mr. Spitzer famous when he served as attorney general.  ''As attorney general, Eliot Spitzer was successful in changing the way we did business on Wall Street,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Now our challenge is to change the way we do business on State Street,'' he said, referring to the thoroughfare that runs alongside the Capitol.  Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group, said he and others would welcome the review.  ''Cuomo's push to ensure that there is merit and accountability behind the doling out of member items is a nice way to end a reform-filled week in Albany,'' Mr. Dadey said.  Called member items because many are proposed by individual members of the Legislature, the grants have a long but not always illustrious history in New York. The grants are distributed by both the Legislature and the governor, and many have been directed to the kinds of programs that traditionally attract government aid, such as legal services for the poor or AIDS education efforts.  Other grants, however, have gone to fix up private hunting clubs and to the clubhouses used by ethnic fraternal organizations, like an Italian-American war veterans post that got money to make improvements to its kitchen.  The grants were once listed individually in the state's budget, where they could be examined by other legislators and the public. But in 1999, when then-Gov. George E. Pataki used his line-item veto to eliminate many items requested by Democratic lawmakers, the items were gathered into a lump sum, making them impossible to review and difficult to control. The more than 6,000 items in the last budget totaled about $200 million.  In his State of the State address on Wednesday, Governor Spitzer proposed that member items once again be listed in the budget individually, a step that both Mr. Bruno and Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, say they support.  A spokeswoman for Mr. Silver said Thursday that the speaker welcomed Mr. Cuomo's plans.  Under the state's Constitution, any program that receives state money must have a public purpose. The exact definition of ''public purpose,'' however, is the product of a multitude of legal decisions stretching back decades, and is relatively broad.  ''It would turn on what the actual use of the money is, but the presumption, if it went to a not-for-profit or a government, is that it's basically for a public purpose,'' Mr. Cuomo said. He also said that he thought a majority of member items served worthwhile purposes, and that he could not think of a member item that has in the past been found by courts or the attorney general's office not to have a public purpose.  Mr. Cuomo did not say whether he thought Mr. Bruno's grants to Evident Technologies would merit any action by his office, citing the federal investigation. ''At the conclusion of the criminal investigation, we will make our determination,'' he said.  ",

Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, the branch of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that runs the subways and buses, announced his resignation yesterday, clearing the way for new leadership at the agency he has run since 1996. Finding a replacement for Mr. Reuter, above, will now become one of the first tasks for the transportation authority's incoming executive director and chief executive, Elliot G. Sander. Mr. Sander was chosen to head the authority by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who has frequently called for a management shake-up at the agency. Mr. Reuter said his departure was not influenced by the change in administration. He plans to leave the authority in early February and will take a job in Miami with Parsons Brinckerhoff, a large engineering company.  WILLIAM NEUMAN  ",

            "text": "  Former Gov. George E. Pataki will soon give up the taxpayer-provided security detail he has enjoyed since leaving office at the end of last year, a spokesman said on Friday.  ''Governor Pataki has requested the state police to begin the phaseout of his temporary security detail,'' said David M. Catalfamo, the spokesman. ''The former governor has been consulting with private security firms to evaluate and meet his needs on a going forward basis.''  Departing governors are rarely granted state security details. State police officials granted one to Mr. Pataki on a temporary basis last year after Mr. Pataki's staff asked them to evaluate whether he would continue to need protection after leaving office.  Gov. Eliot Spitzer approved the arrangement, as did the State Ethics Commission, which had sharply criticized former State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi for his use of state employees as chauffeurs and aides to his wife.  The security detail for Mr. Pataki, who is considering a presidential run, cost at least $20,000 a week, though his aides did not release specific information on the number of troopers assigned to provide him protection, citing security concerns. Only Mr. Pataki -- not his family -- was covered by the detail, and the arrangement was to be periodically reviewed by state police officials, who are responsible for providing protection to New York's governors.  Mr. Catalfamo said Mr. Pataki had decided to switch to a private security detail because ''he's returning to being a private citizen.'' The state police detail would be phased out gradually, he said, on whatever schedule state police officials deemed appropriate.  ''If there's something that they think needs attention, I am certain they will bring it to our attention,'' he said. ''In the meantime, the governor is going to make accommodations on his own.''  ",

We are not ready to endorse a candidate, but it is not too early to lay out the job qualifications, starting with fearless independence. The new comptroller will not only have to audit Gov. Eliot Spitzer's administration, but may also look at any state spending -- including how the Legislature doles out its pork and other political favors. For this reason, the five or so Democratic Assembly members who want the position bear the heaviest burden of showing their independence. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who controls the largest bloc in the Legislature, will play the biggest role in choosing the next comptroller. It should not be someone who goes easy on Mr. Silver and his colleagues in return for getting the job.  Financial expertise is also a must. The new comptroller will single-handedly be responsible for investing $146 billion in state pension money. The state needs someone with a sure hand to protect the state's retirees, and someone who knows how to use the power of that fund to promote good corporate governance and socially responsible investments.  The next comptroller should have a proven record as a reformer. He or she will have to reject pleas to waste scarce positions on the politically connected, and be willing to shake things up, from wasteful public authorities to mismanaged school districts. The person should promise to work for public campaign financing for the comptroller's job.  Mr. Spitzer and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly have agreed on what sounds like a good process. There will be public hearings, and a group of former comptrollers will winnow the field down to five contenders. But in the end legislators will choose. Their responsibility is to choose someone who will look out for the interests of all New Yorkers, not simply those who did the choosing.  Editorial  ",

            "text": "  Long Island on a map looks like one big flat fishy slab, but maps are deceptive. Politically, it's an archipelago: a chain of hundreds of governmental bodies, all separate and independent, and all floating in a sea of taxes.  The proliferation of overlapping taxing districts -- counties, towns, villages, hamlets, fire departments, school systems, sanitary districts -- has left Long Islanders in a trap. They love the amenities of multiple governments but ache under the burden of paying for them all. The cost of living here keeps rising in ways that seem beyond anyone's control, since things like garbage collection and gleaming firetrucks, while expensive, are also seen as essential. Or, if not essential, then at least immovable. In many cases the taxing districts have become politically tenacious fiefdoms: secretive, highly fortified and resistant to siege.  People like to complain about the problem, but it took the Nassau Comptroller, Howard Weitzman, to sink his watchdog's teeth into it. Last month he issued a report highlighting ways that the more than 200 special taxing districts in Nassau -- whose total tax bill was more than $473 million last year -- can save large amounts of money.  But not, he says, by dissolving themselves or consolidating with other districts. These options have often been suggested, most recently by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who wants to create a Commission on Local Government Efficiency to study the problem across the state, which has more than 4,200 taxing districts. Instead, Mr. Weitzman proposes smart trimming around the edges of the problem by imposing greater oversight and by pooling resources.  The first line of defense against special-district overspending -- watchful voters -- is faulty, since special-district elections are obscure rituals in which only the tiniest sliver of the electorate participates. So Mr. Weitzman suggests that town governments step in to control spending. As he interprets state law, towns have the authority to review the budgets of special districts, to compel them to justify expenses and to trim their budgets as needed. Two of Nassau's three towns -- North Hempstead and Oyster Bay -- have already begun doing so. The third, Hempstead, should join them.  Mr. Weitzman's report outlines common-sense ways districts could band together to reduce insurance costs, pooling their risk through group self-insurance and saving money that would otherwise be spent unecessarily on brokers' fees and redundant contracts with private insurance companies. The same cooperation could apply to buying goods and services in bulk, or contracting with town governments for services like snow plowing and tree pruning at rates cheaper than those charged by private companies.  If there was ever any doubt that special-district spending could be tightened, it was shattered in 2005. That was the year Mr. Weitzman conducted eye-opening audits of sanitary districts in Nassau, finding numerous examples of wastefulness and lack of oversight, and Newsday published a series of articles detailing the sometimes grotesquely lavish spending by volunteer fire districts across Long Island. Mr. Spitzer's commission has not yet gotten off the ground. When it does, it would do well to take a page, or several, from Mr. Weitzman's report.  ",

            "text": "  The Spitzer administration and Democrats in the State Assembly are close to agreeing on how to review candidates for state comptroller, a politically charged selection process, state officials said on Monday evening.  The plan, which is still being negotiated, calls for creating an outside panel of experts -- former state or city comptrollers, for example -- and asking the panel to forward a short list of qualified candidates to the entire Legislature for a vote, said several Democrats who were granted anonymity to describe the private negotiations.  The choice of a comptroller to replace Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned in disgrace, has been a flashpoint between Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Assembly. The governor has said he would like an outsider with financial experience, while some lawmakers are vying for the post and others warn that the governor should not be allowed to choose the fiscal officer who will audit his agencies and monitor his budgets and contracts.  While aides to Mr. Spitzer have said they would like the new comptroller to have financial expertise and to come from ''outside government,'' Mr. Spitzer signaled on Monday that he would be open to considering a candidate from the Assembly.  ''I have never said that one of them couldn't be a good comptroller, or one of them might not end up being a good comptroller,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''What I have said is that we need to look for certain standards and qualifications, and begin with a question relating to qualifications, rather than membership, and then we go from there.''  While the State Constitution gives the Legislature the power the choose the next comptroller to fill the vacancy -- and the Assembly Democrats have the deciding vote, since they constitute a majority of the Legislature -- the Spitzer administration has been trying to recruit candidates and to influence the final decision.  Candidates will be invited to speak at a joint legislative hearing. Some details of the agreement must still be resolved, including who would serve on the panel, and how brief its list would be. Once the list is forwarded, though, it will still fall to the Assembly to choose a candidate from it -- and it is unclear how much deference Assembly Democrats intend to give to the new governor's wishes.

            "text": "  To the Editor:  ''Studies on Ferry Service Come Amid Skepticism'' (Dec. 17), on potential ferry service linking Bridgeport, Stamford and New York City, describes the efforts of Joseph A. Riccio, the executive director of the Bridgeport Port Authority, to improve the traffic problems in Connecticut by promoting water transportation to New York City.  The unmitigated increase of traffic has caused the federal government and the states to support ferry services that can help alleviate this problem. Our ferry -- a private service that carries passengers and vehicles between Bridgeport and Port Jefferson on Long Island -- has received some of those funds.  Unfortunately, there's another side to this story in Bridgeport. Regrettably, the Bridgeport Port Authority, created in the early 1990s to generate income for a struggling Bridgeport, decided not to help our ferry, but to tax it.  Over the years, this tax has taken more than $12 million from our ferry operation that could have been put to good use for the traveling public we try to serve.  The Port Authority has spent much of the $12 million on ill-conceived projects that can only be described as wasteful. The high-speed ferry is but one example. Virtually everyone agrees that it is not economically viable, but that has not stopped the Port Authority from spending tax money it collects from our ferry, as well as government funds, to pursue that pipe dream.  We have sued the Port Authority to cease the taxing of our ferry operation and to recover the overcharges. The trial, in United States District Court for Connecticut in Hartford, has concluded, and we are awaiting the court's decision.  (Capt.) Brian McAllister  President, The Bridgeport and Port Jefferson Steamboat Company  Bridgeport  ",

            "text": "  The strange race to become the next comptroller of New York State began in earnest on Friday as at least 18 candidates took the first step toward being considered by submitting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to the State Legislature.  The aspirants include six Democratic state lawmakers, eight current and former government officials and four businessmen. Prominent newcomers who expressed interest in the job included Martha E. Stark, the New York City finance commissioner; James L. Larocca, who served in the Cuomo and Carey cabinets; and Alphonse Fletcher Jr., a money manager and philanthropist.  The entire Legislature will select the new state comptroller, but the real power to make the choice rests with the Assembly Democrats, its largest voting bloc. Many politicians here said they believed that the state lawmakers on the list have the inside track for the job.  The popularly elected comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, won with a comfortable majority in November, only to resign his four-year term in December after pleading guilty to a felony for using a state worker as a driver and aide for his wife.  It is unclear if there are more than 18 candidates because the Assembly Democrats, who had pledged to conduct an open and public selection process, declined to say who had applied for the job by the time the deadline of Friday at noon had passed. They said that they would not release a list of candidates until Monday, when the candidates must submit financial disclosure forms. The Republican-led Senate provided its list of candidates, which officials said they thought was complete but could not say for sure.  Aides to the new governor, Eliot Spitzer, made it clear this month that they would prefer an independent candidate with fiscal experience from outside government. But after the Spitzer administration had trouble encouraging candidates to apply, the governor said that he would be open to a candidate from the Assembly.  Governor Spitzer negotiated a selection process with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, that calls for the candidates to be interviewed by the Legislature's joint fiscal committees, and then screened by a panel of three former New York State and New York City comptrollers. The panel will then whittle down the list to no more than five candidates, and the members of the Legislature will pick one from that pool.  Several Democrats and Republicans who saw the preliminary list of people interested in the job said that the qualifications of the candidates from outside the Legislature appeared to be so strong that it was unlikely that more than two, or maybe three, lawmakers would make the final list of five candidates -- which would shift the political calculus, depending on who makes the final cut.  The decision will probably rest with Mr. Silver, who has influence over the 108 Assembly Democrats, or a majority of the Legislature, which currently has 211 members. He is expected to take the governor's views into consideration, and a number of other groups will most likely weigh in, from caucuses within the Assembly to party leaders outside the Assembly.  Five assemblymen are seeking the post -- Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester, Thomas P. DiNapoli of Nassau County, Alexander B. Grannis of Manhattan, Joseph D. Morelle of the Rochester area, and Felix Ortiz of Brooklyn -- along with one state senator, Martin Connor of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Mr. DiNapoli is well liked by many colleagues, and could emerge as a consensus candidate, but is generally better known for his environmental work here than for his work on fiscal issues. Mr. Brodsky has been lining up votes and stressing the investigations he conducted into state authorities, but some of his colleagues view him as acerbic. Mr. Ortiz has the support of Hispanic groups.  The comptroller oversees the state's $145.7 billion pension fund, audits state agencies and local governments, and monitors state and local budgets.  Perhaps because of calls that the state's top fiscal office should not be given to a political appointee, several of the assemblymen vying for the post are taking steps to play down their political ties: Mr. Morelle quit his job as the chairman of the Monroe County Democratic Party, and Mr. DiNapoli stepped down from his position on the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee.  But more outsiders are seeking the job than lawmakers. They include William J. Mulrow, an investment banker who ran for comptroller in 2002 and who is close to Mr. Spitzer. But his bid could face difficulty because he is a member of one of the groups bidding for the state's valuable horseracing franchise.  And several state and local finance officials have expressed interest as well, including Howard S. Weitzman, the Nassau County comptroller; Andrew A. SanFilippo, the Buffalo comptroller; David Hancox, the director of state audits at the state comptroller's office; Philip LaTessa, the Syracuse auditor; Andrew S. Eristoff, who was the tax and finance commissioner in the Pataki administration, and Robert S. Hoffman, a former auditor in the state tax department.  So many people applied that the public hearing that is scheduled for Tuesday, where candidates will be invited to make 15-minute statements and take questions, may take more than one day. It could be crowded: since the hearing will be held by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, more than 60 lawmakers could conceivably be sitting on the da\u00efs and asking questions.  Candidates for comptroller who serve on those committees will not be allowed to question the other candidates, Assembly officials said.  ",

He has pledged to reform the way the state does business and to bring a higher ethical standard to Albany.

            "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''The George Pataki Era'' (editorial, Dec. 31):  Gov. George E. Pataki's public service announcements kept running while he ran around the country trying to position himself for a 2008 presidential run. Meanwhile at home, the G.O.P. was collapsing. Mr. Pataki's record deficits, excessive spending and late budgets gave real conservative Republicans anguish.  New York State is now the No. 2 state in the country in terms of long-term debt. Each adult New York resident is responsible for $3,515 of the $50 billion total debt, which almost doubled in the years Mr. Pataki was governor. To that you can add the debt of the New York State public authorities, now $114 billion.  While Mr. Pataki was governor, Republicans lost numerous public offices, including Senate and Congressional seats, the office of the attorney general, county executive offices, and State Senate and Assembly seats.  In 2008, intelligent primary voters will look past glitzy commercials and remember Mr. Pataki's fiscal mismanagement and the destruction of the state's Republican Party.  Larry Penner  Great Neck, N.Y.  To the Editor:  You did not mention the two most important areas of responsibility of any governor today: economic development and education.  When George E. Pataki's lack of accomplishment in matters of economic development and education is factored in, his administration can be seen as nothing other than a complete and utter failure.  Paul T. Shoemaker  Bronxville  To the Editor:  I question your characterization of Gov. George E. Pataki's choices to lead the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (or what many call the ''Leave Manhattan Destroyed Committee'') as ''excellent,'' and your description of their preferred plans as ''first-rate.''  The official planning process for the World Trade Center site was an outrage and disgrace from the start, designed to ensure that plans that responded in the only appropriate manner -- rebuilding on the scale and in the spirit of what was destroyed -- were never even considered.  Gov. Eliot Spitzer could get off to a great start by consigning the Daniel Libeskind plan and the misguided priorities that produced it to the trash bin.  Louis Epstein  Carmel, N.Y.

            "text": "  The political odd couples are not only on the Democratic side of the Nassau State Senate race.  The Republican candidate, Maureen O'Connell, recently wrote a letter to Governor Spitzer urging him to support a Nassau County Democrat, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, below, for state comptroller.  ''As the taxpayers' advocate, the state comptroller must possess independence and integrity,'' Ms. O'Connell wrote in the letter, which was also published in a local newspaper. ''Assemblyman DiNapoli personifies these traits and, through his lifetime of public service, he has earned the public's trust.''  Mr. DiNapoli is one of at least 18 people -- lawmakers, current or former officials and businessmen -- seeking to replace the former comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned after pleading guilty to a felony for using a state worker to chauffeur his wife.  Ms. O'Connell, who is running in a district where registered Democrats now outnumber registered Republicans, said in an interview that she had not yet run into any Republicans who were miffed that she would back a Democrat for the high-profile office.  Since Democrats will have the upper hand in choosing the next comptroller, few Republicans expressed any interest in the race -- with one exception being Andrew S. Eristoff, a commissioner of tax and finance in the Pataki administration.  ''The reason I wrote the letter is because I've known Tom DiNapoli for a long time,'' Ms. O'Connell, herself a former assemblywoman from the area, said in an interview. ''I think he's the right person for the job. He's a man of character and integrity and honesty.''  NICHOLAS CONFESSORE  ALBANY NOTEBOOK  ",

            "text": "  For months, the state capital has been consumed by talk of state and federal investigations into the legislative pet projects known as member items.  But it turns out that those items, which cost about $200 million a year, are just the tip of the iceberg.  In 2006, an election year, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature committed to borrowing $1.9 billion for an array of initiatives similar to member items, only costing nearly 10 times as much. Many of those grants went to politically connected companies and nonprofit organizations in lawmakers' districts.  The little-noticed practice of using borrowed money to pay for what critics consider pork barrel projects began in the late 1990s, when the Legislature authorized debt to finance improvements to the Buffalo Bills' football stadium, a move that was denounced by the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, in part because it did not involve voter approval.  But the practice reached its apex last year, as Mr. Pataki was leaving office. The projects approved in the last nine months of 2006 exceeded the total amount of borrowed money disbursed over the previous eight years. According to a report published last year by a nonprofit group, the Center for Government Research, the previous borrowing totaled $1.7 billion.  Even before last year, New York had one of the highest levels of per capita debt in the nation. Budget watchdog groups assert that the recent borrowing for capital initiatives will sharply increase the state's debt burden, projected to cost $7 billion annually by 2010. Some people also say it raises new questions about Mr. Pataki's fiscal stewardship of the state.  The full details of the 2006 election-year borrowing spree became available only after Gov. Eliot Spitzer took office this month, because the Pataki administration had prevented the Empire State Development Corporation, the quasi-public authority that handles much of the state's borrowing, from releasing a master list of its projects.  These projects differ from other types of state economic development aid because they are financed at the request of individual legislators or the governor, forgoing more rigorous and competitive application processes by state agencies.  Like member items, these capital projects are, for the most part, not listed in the state budget and therefore are generally not subject to legislative debate or public scrutiny. And as with member items, legislative leaders allocate the borrowed funds based on the seniority, loyalty or political vulnerability of a lawmaker.  But unlike member items, which are paid for out of the annual budget, the capital projects are financed with borrowed money that is repaid over many years.  The borrowed money went to all manner of projects, including construction costs, equipment purchasing and occasionally operating expenses.  A $2,521.83 grant was used to repave streets in Plattsburgh, for instance, and $50,000 went to build a new driveway for a Long Island church. Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, was co-sponsor of a $650 million grant to lure an Advanced Micro Devices semiconductor plant to his district. Another Republican, Senator William J. Larkin Jr., directed $75,000 toward the purchase of new lights at a Little League field in his Hudson Valley district.  Assembly Democrats used much of their money to offset education cuts or assist colleges, including by borrowing $26 million to help the State University of New York buy a supercomputer.  Over the last decade, lawmakers have used the money to finance a number of failed economic development projects, including a now-defunct high-speed ferry between Rochester and Canada that cost the state millions of dollars.  Among the projects on his voluminous list, Mr. Pataki directed $12.6 million to the small city of Peekskill -- where he was once mayor -- to fix bathrooms at a local arts center and to renovate a historic theater and a train station. He sent an additional $7.3 million to build new wings at Hudson Valley Hospital, where he had an emergency appendectomy last year.  Assistants to Mr. Pataki and Senate Republicans said the borrowing was used mostly for economic development projects that brought jobs to the state, and they asserted that there was adequate oversight.  ''Whether it's the A.M.D. fab in Malta, the Adirondack Museum in Tupper Lake or Cornell's nanofabrication initiative in Ithaca, making smart capital investments in New York's economic, intellectual and transportation infrastructure is essential to transforming New York's economy,'' said David Catalfamo, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki.  ''Governor Pataki believes these investments are especially crucial to upstate communities as we continue to transition from a traditional industry-based economy to an economy based in knowledge and innovation,'' Mr. Catalfamo said.  Governor Spitzer has said he will end the practice of borrowing for pet projects, a move legislative leaders say they support. Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo has said he will investigate whether such projects fulfill a legitimate public purpose and has vowed to recover funds that he determines were misspent.  Mr. Spitzer and his staff also say they will take their first major borrowing proposal, a stem cell research fund, to the voters.  Doing so would ''allow the public to make a choice as to whether this is a long-term investment worth making,'' said Paul Francis, Mr. Spitzer's budget director.  Mr. Francis also said that the governor would send a signal in his first budget address in the coming weeks ''that we're going to have a much more analytical process that evaluates the cost and benefits based on objective criteria.''  Budget experts on both sides of the political aisle criticized borrowing for pet projects.  ''It's one of the worst examples of a very flawed and very poor fiscal practice that we're going to pay for in the long run,'' Mr. McCall, a Democrat, said.  Edmund J. McMahon, executive director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, an affiliate of the Manhattan Institute, a nonprofit conservative policy group, said last year was ''the triple witching hour of pork.''  ''They've been building up towards this; every pot of money they have surges in an election year and especially with a change in power,'' he said.  Like many other conservatives who once supported Mr. Pataki, Mr. McMahon found fault with his fiscal policies.  ''It was something that he enabled and enthusiastically participated in,'' he said, adding, ''I'm sure they'll say the Legislature made them do it. Baloney!''  Untangling these projects is difficult. The Legislature and Mr. Pataki have created almost a dozen pots of borrowed money to finance their initiatives. And most of the projects are never delineated in the budget; the grant to A.M.D. for a manufacturing plant near Albany was one of the exceptions.  The money is allocated to two major authorities with politically appointed boards. The governor and the Republican-controlled Senate typically have channeled projects through the Empire State Development Corporation, while the Democratic-controlled Assembly has financed its projects out of the Dormitory Authority.  Many of the private companies that have received aid had political connections to lawmakers or the governor.  More than $200,000, for instance, was directed last year to the New York, Susquehanna and Western Rail Corporation. (The rail line has received millions more in similar state aid over the years.) The railroad is headed by a prominent donor to Mr. Pataki and other Republicans, Walter Rich, who is being investigated by the state Lobbying Commission over his fund-raising activities.  The commission recently rejected an attempt by the company to be co-hosts to scores of legislators and their spouses on a private rail trip from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., to Canada.  ''Rehabilitating rail tracks in the Adirondacks will help draw visitors and boost economic opportunities throughout the region,'' Mr. Pataki said in one of his last public statements, which announced millions of dollars of new grants to Mr. Rich's company and other rail lines.  Lawmakers from both parties also directed nearly $1 million to SuperPower Inc. of Schenectady, a maker of superconducting cables. Political action committees connected to SuperPower had contributed to Mr. Pataki, Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.  Mr. Bruno also directed $195,000 to Autotask and another $195,000 to e.nfrastructure (now called nfrastructure), two small companies in his district. Officials with the two technology firms said they had requested aid from Mr. Bruno to help their expanding operations stay in the capital region.  Federal authorities have been investigating Mr. Bruno's outside consulting business for several months and have issued subpoenas to at least one business that received member item money from him. Executives at Autotask and nfrastructure said they had not received subpoenas in that investigation and had never been clients of Mr. Bruno's consulting firm.  Dan Moran, vice president of human resources at nfrastructure, said that the application process for the state money was ''extensive,'' adding, ''we had to show every single penny we spent.'' He said that Mr. Bruno's staff played an important role in helping his company win the grant.  Richard Frederick, the president of Autotask, said he had recently been told his grant was ''on hold,'' though it was approved last month.  Jessica Copen, a spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation, said that ''some of these grants require public hearings, so that's why some have been held up, and the new administration just received signature power yesterday, and that means they can actually sign the grant disbursement agreements.''  John McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, said that, like Mr. Spitzer, the Senate Republicans supported putting all future spending on initiatives, whether member items or capital projects, in the state budget.  But he defended the spending. ''The projects that we fund are principally geared to create jobs and attract business and employers to the state,'' he said.  Correction:  January 18, 2007, Thursday  An article on Sunday about a record set in 2006 for the amount of borrowed money the New York Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki committed to pet projects included an erroneous reference from David Catalfamo, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, to a museum that Mr. Catalfamo defended as a worthwhile investment. It is the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks in Tupper Lake -- not the Adirondack Museum, which is in Blue Mountain Lake.  ",

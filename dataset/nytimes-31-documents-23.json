I've been visiting Charleston for 15 years, I even honeymooned here, and it's a place where I've always wanted to own a home. I looked for years, but of course the closer I got to the city center, the higher the cost. I discovered this little gem about a year ago. It's 320 square feet with a 100-square-foot courtyard. When I bought it, it needed work. I redid the bathroom, since the only thing holding it up was the tile, and turned the full kitchen into a kitchenette.  The biggest thing in the apartment is the fireplace. It's 84 inches, while the kitchenette is only 54 inches across. But a big fireplace is part of the historic nature of this 200-year-old building. It's only two rooms but proved to be the hardest two rooms I've ever had to decorate. Though it's the smallest unit in the building, I wouldn't think about giving up my courtyard for a bigger space.  I live at the beach, so when I want to get away, I come here. We're two and a half hours away and make it here about twice a month. Generally my husband, Ron Cooper, and I will arrive late on a Friday night. We park the car out front and don't move it again until we leave at the end of the weekend. The condo is right on Queen Street, so we can walk to shopping on King Street and to restaurants. Charleston has a growing gallery district, and we are right in the heart of it. But when I first arrive, I just love to spend time in our home.  I never say I have a place in Charleston. I don't want people to think that I have a mansion in the city or one of the newer, grand apartments, so instead, I always say that I have ''a space'' in Charleston.

Telluride is home to one of the very first hydroelectric power plants, and this building used to belong to the Telluride Power Company. When you walk in the front door, there's a little slot. It says ''Bills.'' Our windows look out on the gondola station and mountains. Nothing will get built there.  We live in Las Vegas, but I'd been coming to Telluride for years. When our daughter was born, I began trying to convince Bree we could move here permanently and live happily ever after. That fell on deaf ears. But when my half-brother expressed interest in starting a business, and told us his daughter, Berkeley, was attending aesthetician school, Bree and I got to thinking about trying it out, since Berkeley could run the shop. Our salon is about 300 square feet and the rest of the commercial space is a real estate office.  Living in a commercial building can be funky. The bathroom, for example, has two doors, one that was designed as a public entrance for the community, and one that was for the office workers. You can have a bath in there during business hours, but you have to be very careful.  We didn't want to compromise the integrity of the building, so we didn't put in a kitchen. We have a microwave and a little fridge for necessities, but we mostly go out to eat. That's fine with us. The restaurants here are great, and Berkeley's husband runs two of the nearby gyro carts, so we're about 100 feet from the best sandwiches in town.

            "text": "  PEOPLE interested in buying brownstones or town houses should not assume that all of the bargains are gone. Brokers say there are still properties in New York City that cost less than $1 million, but only if buyers are willing to venture into often overlooked neighborhoods and tolerate extensive renovations.  ''You can still get a lovely brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant for well under $1 million,'' said William S. Ross, executive director of sales for Halstead Property in Brooklyn. ''The market begins around $650,000 to $700,000 for a real four-story brownstone.''  Because brownstones in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights have been less appealing to renovators than those in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope and Carroll Gardens, many still have original details, Mr. Ross said. These often include fireplace mantels, tall parlor windows and high ceilings.  Mr. Ross, who owns a brownstone in Cobble Hill, warns buyers to invest upfront in advisers -- like engineers knowledgeable about brownstones -- who can identify all of the costly problems that inevitably arise. If a brownstone in a historic district needs a new facade, for instance, that alone can cost $100,000, he said. Restoration work can also be pricey -- restoring moldings in a living room can cost $40,000.  But buyers say that these changes can be worth the hassle. In 2002, Florence Clutch, now a vice president at Halstead, bought a brownstone in Crown Heights for about $350,000. She spent about $150,000 in renovations like updating the electricity and replacing the water main, to increase water pressure. Now she rents out three floors and believes she could sell her property for three times the purchase price. Ms. Clutch says that 8 to 10 brownstones in Crown Heights typically come up for sale each year.  There are always houses on the market requiring renovation. One of Ms. Clutch's listings, a two-family town home at 1318 Prospect Place in Park Slope offered at $559,000, will require ''tons'' of investment from a buyer, in cosmetic renovations and in dealing with current tenants, she said.  A town house for sale in Bedford-Stuyvesant, at 177 Nostrand Avenue, was recently reduced in price to $620,000 from $640,000. The broker, Malik Mitchell, who is an executive vice president for Century 21 NY Metro, estimated that the buyer would have to spend about $40,000 to make the walls and floors presentable.  A buyer would also have to deal with the city bureaucracy to get the home's classification changed to a three-family from the current two-family, if he or she wanted to legally rent out the already renovated basement apartment.  While most empty shells of brownstones in Harlem fetch more than $1 million, Prudential Douglas Elliman is selling a brownstone at 237 West 131st Street for $895,000. Todd Stevens, the agent representing the seller, says its situation across from public housing might make it attractive to an investor for converting into studios.  Brokers say buyers willing to wait for deals on town houses might look in areas like Sunnyside in Queens and Mott Haven in the Bronx. Carmela Massimo, an associate broker with Welcome Home Real Estate, estimates that a town house comes on the market in Sunnyside about every six months. Buyers willing to take on renovation projects typically pay about $600,000 for one-family homes and $800,000 for two-family homes, she said.  The enclave of 100-year-old town homes in Mott Haven also offers properties costing about $600,000 to $750,000 when they come to market. Sasha Catus, president of Catus Properties, is listing a 107-year-old two-family town house at 304 Alexander Avenue for $749,000. He says that prices for these town houses have doubled in the last two to three years because of the steep increases in nearby Harlem. ''In Brooklyn and Harlem,'' Mr. Catus said, ''you have several thousand town houses, whereas in the South Bronx you have a fraction of that. The commodity itself is rare.''  ",

            "text": "  This cabin is less than 10 minutes from our house in Madison and it's only about 700 square feet. But it's right on the lake, and it has a detached garage. That was the real attraction for me, because up until then, I'd been trying to build a Renegade ice yacht in my basement. This required punching a hole in the wall, something that wasn't very pleasing to my wife. This garage, on the other had, is already in borderline tear-down condition, so, you know, knocking out holes isn't that big a deal.  I must have been 11 or 12 years old the first time I saw an ice boat. It was one of those years with beautiful black ice on the lake. I was skating with a group of friends, and this guy sailed by and offered to tow us across the lake. I knew I had to have one.  So, right after college, I started building and sailing. From the beginning, I had great help from the guys at the Four Lakes Ice Yacht Club. It's been around for about 80 years, and the older guys have been real mentors to me. Nothing gets me out of bed like checking on the work I did on a boat the day before. I just grab a cup of coffee and go straight to the garage to take a look.  Ice boating is similar to sailing, but unlike regular sailing, the friction is minimal, you can sail upward of five times the speed of wind. Therein lies the thrill. Sitting low, so close to the ice, it feels like you're going 100 miles an hour. For years, I was able to lie about things like that, but now with global positioning systems, I know it's more like 60.

            "text": "  IT is a fine feeling to step into the elevator of an apartment building, press the button marked ''PH'' and take a ride to the top -- or at least near the top. And at a time when the wealthiest New Yorkers are getting even wealthier, there are more buildings in Manhattan with many more of these elevator buttons that bespeak the privileges of penthouse living.  Christine Harris, a 34-year-old director at UBS Global Asset Management in Manhattan, expects to experience that feeling when she and her boyfriend move into their $2.5 million 11th-floor penthouse on the northern edges of Chelsea when the apartment is completed next summer.  Speaking by telephone over the clatter of the UBS trading floor, Ms. Harris calmly envisioned opening her apartment to friends for French feasts and glasses of pinot, and unwinding after work on her private 700-square-foot terrace.  ''It's just nice to come home on a summer night and have a bottle of wine when you're in all of this madness in the city,'' she said.  While many Manhattan developers are scrambling to find buyers for their newly constructed and converted luxury apartments, they say they're having little trouble selling their penthouses, which have become the trinkets of choice in the wake of the city's record Wall Street bonus season. These apartments, which have accounted for just 2.5 percent of the sales transactions in Manhattan over roughly the last two decades, are now often selling faster than the cheaper studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments.  At Ms. Harris's new building, the Onyx at 261 West 28th Street, Bronfman Haymes Real Estate Partners has contracts to sell all three of the building's penthouses, while 30 of the other 52 units remain unsold.  At 170 East End Avenue (at 88th Street), Skyline Developers sold one penthouse for $12 million, and the one next door for $14 million. Skyline's president, Orin Wilf, said he had turned down an offer of $14.5 million to see if he could get $16 million for each of the two remaining penthouses. Fifty-one of the 93 units are unsold in the building. He said he had negotiated on prices for apartments on the lower floors in the past.  Mr. Wilf says he thinks that the penthouses will sell even better when buyers see the completed apartments. ''We're in no rush to sell them,'' he said while standing in one half-constructed penthouse over the barks of dogs in Carl Schurz Park, 19 stories below.  Even at 15 Central Park West (at 61st Street), all 15 penthouses in the project's two buildings have been sold for prices as high as $45 million, while about 30 of the building's 202 units remain unsold. ''I wish we had 20 more to sell,'' said William Lie Zeckendorf, a co-chairman of Zeckendorf Development.  Penthouses, which once were identified more with bachelors and newlyweds seeking terrace space for their cocktail parties, are even attracting the stroller crowd, which seems to like the extra bedrooms and terraces found in the newer residential buildings.  When Gregory O'Hara, a private equity investor, needed to relocate his family to New York from Miami, his wife, Glorimar, started looking for homes that would give them some outdoor space for their 14-month-old son, Henry.  The couple bought a $5.5 million triplex at 5 East 13th Street. Standing in the penthouse she will move into next month, Ms. O'Hara described her plans to set up a swing set, sandbox and outdoor movie theater on the terrace as Henry grinned and toddled his first tentative steps.  ''It may be great for a bachelor, but it's great for a family,'' Ms. O'Hara said. ''We have lots of outdoor space.''  Brokers say that Wall Street and hedge fund executives are often the first in line for penthouses, because the apartments confirm their ''master of the universe'' status among their neighbors.  Maureen Carroll, who previously worked on Wall Street and who now has her own brokerage firm specializing in selling apartments to Wall Street executives, had one client turn down an apartment when he found out there was a better one in the building.  The ''second best'' notion apparently contradicts these executives' self-image. ''They're not going to live in a building where they're the second-largest shareholder or there's another unit that's larger,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''The game doesn't stop when you go home at night.''  Average prices for penthouses in Manhattan jumped by 16.6 percent to $2.3 million in 2006, from $2 million in 2005, according to data collected by the Miller Samuel appraisal company. The number of deals jumped to 225 in 2006, from 184 in 2005. Jonathan J. Miller, the company's president, predicts these numbers will grow in 2007 because most penthouse buyers like Ms. Harris have not yet closed on their new condominiums.  These strong penthouse sales are persuading more developers to push the limits on how they define penthouses, and in some cases, they are making them more lavish than ever before. Shaun Osher, the chief executive of Core Group Marketing, which is handling the Onyx, is advising developers on the 25 other projects his company represents, to design all of their penthouses with more elaborate finishes so that they can ask even higher prices.  Josh Guberman, the president and chief executive of the Core Development Group (which has no relation to Mr. Osher's firm), sold the O'Haras their triplex at 5 East 13th only 48 hours after sales began last summer. He said he now planned to divide one penthouse in his next project, on the Upper East Side, into two duplexes, which will be priced at $5.5 million each.  Edward Minskoff, the president of Edward J. Minskoff Equities Inc., sold five penthouses at 101 Warren Street in TriBeCa at prices ranging from $4 million to $20 million within 10 days of its opening last April. Since then, he has sold about 150 of the building's 227 apartments. He is now building more apartments on top of the building than he had originally planned.  Donald J. Trump, who has been trying to sell his penthouse on the 31st and 32nd floors of 502 Park Avenue (59th Street) for $32 million on and off for the last two years, is now enlarging the master bedroom suite to about 1,400 square feet, up from 665 square feet, by enclosing an existing terrace and building a new terrace on top. He said he now planned to list the apartment at $42 million because the new terrace space will be on the higher floor and will open from the living room.  While Mr. Trump's penthouse is, in fact, on the top two floors, he contends that the definition of a penthouse has now become broader, a point his peers have also caught on to.  ''Penthouses are starting to go lower and lower in terms of the top of the building,'' Mr. Trump said. ''The top three, four or even five or six floors of the building can be defined as penthouses. The key is the number you put on the elevator.''  Mr. Trump says he typically builds six floors of penthouses in his towers. Mr. Minskoff calls the apartments on the 34th and 35th floors at 101 Warren ''sky homes'' and the apartments on the 32nd and 33rd floors penthouses.  On the other hand, at the Onyx, Matthew Bronfman and Evan Haymes stick to a strict interpretation: only the apartments on the top floor, the 11th, are called penthouses.  There are also penthouses in far shorter buildings. Mr. Guberman refers to the apartments on the top floor of his six-story building at 5 East 13th Street as penthouses, and he plans to do the same for his Upper East Side duplexes.  Michael Morris, a professor in Columbia's psychology department and the head of a social intelligence program at its business school, said the trend in penthouses revealed a marked preference for displays of conspicuous consumption. He said the people buying the penthouses exhibit their wealth by purchasing real estate that is physically higher than their neighbors', even if their apartments offer little more than views of surrounding buildings.  In many cases, he said, such buyers would rather have a penthouse on a high floor of a new building than an apartment in a prestigious but shorter building like the Dakota. ''It's a very simple marker of status,'' Professor Morris said. ''It's very easy to see. It's very easy for other people to see.''  But some penthouse buyers reject the idea that their purchases have anything to do with status. They say that newly constructed penthouses typically offer the most room, highest ceilings and most expansive terraces. They emphasize the privacy that such spaces can create in the heart of Manhattan.  Maria Bosoni and her husband, Alexandre, have put down a deposit for the $12 million penthouse on the 19th floor of 170 East End Avenue. The Bosonis currently live in a penthouse in the Bloomberg Tower.  Ms. Bosoni sees no special cachet in the ''penthouse'' designation. ''It makes no difference to us,'' she said. ''It's just that the penthouse is the better apartment. It makes for a better apartment because of the square footage and the height.''  Brokers agree that while their buyers are pretty direct about what they want from their penthouses, they also like the fact that newly built versions have more room than those of the past.  Servants were typically the city's earliest inhabitants of apartment buildings' top floors, because getting up there involved climbing so many stairs. Few New Yorkers wanted to spend time on terraces because of the black soot spewing from the elevated trains.  Kathy Sloane, a senior vice president of Brown Harris Stevens and the broker for Mr. Trump's apartment at 502 Park, said that buyers who think they want a prewar penthouse may not like what they find.  ''Penthouses were more difficult to sell because they're often quirky,'' she said. ''They weren't designed to be penthouses. People weren't necessarily ready to take on the task of making a great penthouse out of a lot of rooms.''  Developers are also expanding the definition of penthouse to link it more to lifestyle than to height. Mr. Guberman is adding play areas to the fifth-, sixth- and seventh-floor apartments at a second East Side project, at 433 East 74th Street, to attract family buyers. He plans to call the seventh-floor apartments penthouses and the fifth- and sixth-floor units ''flex'' penthouses.  ''A penthouse talks to the world of exclusion and privacy,'' Mr. Guberman said. ''It doesn't really matter if it has five stories or eight stories. Once you get up there, it's about having your own oasis separate and removed from the balance of the building.''  Mr. Minskoff, the creator of sky homes and penthouses at 101 Warren, said that even he can be confused by the definitions he has come up with. ''They're all very large apartments with high ceilings almost at the top of the building,'' he said. ''I'm not sure if you can absolutely differentiate.''  Mr. Trump is cautious about how long the penthouse craze may last and won't say how many penthouses he may build in his next New York project, a condo in SoHo that won't be completed for two and a half years. But he contends that penthouses will always have more allure than brownstones, with their understated charms.  ''I live in a beautiful penthouse because I love the views,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I look at brownstones: You're looking at garbage cans, and you look at air-conditioning units. You just can't compare.''  ",

            "text": "  WHO -- Mike Einstein, 54, an electronics executive from Crystal Lake, Ill.  WHAT -- 4-bedroom house  WHERE -- St. Petersburg, Fla.  When I bought this house two years ago it was really a tear-down, but I decided instead to fix it up. In the process, I added a full wireless automation system to the house. I'm the director of corporate innovation for Intermatic, which makes, among other products, wireless lighting controls. There are a slew of products out there from different manufacturers including thermostats and security systems that have wireless capability and can be controlled remotely over the Internet.  When my son comes down here and turns the thermostat down to 68 degrees, I can turn it back up from my home in Illinois. I can log on to a Web page from anywhere and control all the lights, the drapes, the outdoor lights, the garage door and even the temperature of the hot tub. One day, I logged on and saw that the hot tub was 103 degrees. My son had been using the house and forgot to turn it off. I don't ever rent out my house, but family members use it when I'm not there. They don't always remember to turn off the lights or adjust the thermostat when they leave. They don't get the electric bill.  Hard-wiring an existing house with these capabilities would be an electrician's dream. It would cost tens of thousands of dollars. But with these new wireless systems it ran about $4,000 to set up. But more importantly, it gives me peace of mind. The house still has old hurricane shutters that have to be put up the old-fashioned way, but early this year new models that attach to the house and can be operated over a computer should be out.  As told to Amy Gunderson  Information on properties was supplied by the listing companies.  WHERE -- Coronado, Calif.  WHAT -- 4-bedroom house  HOW MUCH -- $4.1 million  This three-level, 4,000-square-foot house is wired so the heat, air-conditioning and rooftop hot tub can be controlled remotely from a computer. A central system in the house controls the thermostat, lighting and security. The house has four and a half bathrooms, granite counters and an elevator. It has 40 feet of waterfront and a dock that can accommodate two 60-foot boats. Coronado is about five miles southwest of San Diego.

            "text": "  Dara Kane loves almost everything about Peter Cooper Village, from her spacious apartment and friendly neighbors at the complex overlooking the East River near 23rd Street to the park-like grounds and the elementary school her 7-year-old attends.  But Ms. Kane and her family are moving out.  She said her landlord notified her that the rent on her two-bedroom apartment was going up $700 a month, or 18.7 percent, to $4,450 from $3,750, beginning Feb. 28. That is on top of the $500 rent increase she got last year. It is just too much, she said.  Ms. Kane and dozens of other tenants paying market-rate rents are suffering from sticker shock in the first wave of lease renewal letters being sent out by Tishman Speyer Properties, which bought Peter Cooper Village and its sister complex, Stuyvesant Town, in October in a record-breaking $5.4 billion deal.  Some tenants among the nearly 25,000 residents in the two complexes report that their rents are going up as much as 33 percent, the latest sign that the two complexes, long regarded as an affordable haven in Manhattan for middle-class New Yorkers, are changing.  ''It's really a special place,'' Ms. Kane said. ''But they are not interested in retaining any stable tenancy. When people like us leave, you have to wonder, how are the public schools going to survive? How will the 14th Street Y sustain itself? All those things are going to suffer.''  Evan Horisk, a television producer for PR Newswire, a corporate news network, moved out of his two-bedroom apartment in Stuyvesant Town on Jan. 4, after the landlord notified him that his rent would jump 26 percent, to $3,350 from $2,660 a month.  ''It flipped my life upside down,'' Mr. Horisk said. ''Living there was great. The renovations were superb. The maintenance was top-notch.'' But, he added, ''I didn't get a big raise this year that can compensate for that kind of increase.''  While moving vans may be a more common site in front of the 110 buildings that make up Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town, a wholesale exodus is not under way. Indeed, Rob Speyer, a senior managing director at Tishman Speyer, said that roughly 80 percent of the tenants are renewing their leases, regardless of the increases.  He said the company is only raising rents to market levels from below-market rates. It was a process begun by the previous owner, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, over the past four years.  ''We're generating significant demand from existing residents as well as from the outside,'' Mr. Speyer said. ''Our rents are well within the market, and our renewal rates demonstrate that.''  According to Citi Habitats, a rental broker in Manhattan, the average rent in the neighborhood east of Gramercy Park, which adjoins Peter Cooper Village, was $2,785 for a one-bedroom apartment and $3,846 for a two-bedroom apartment. Those rents include buildings with doormen, an amenity that neither Peter Cooper Village nor Stuyvesant Town has.  Last year, rents rose an average of 10 percent in Manhattan, while the vacancy rate fell below 1 percent.  ''Depending on the neighborhood, the increases were anywhere from 7 percent to 20 percent,'' said Gordon Golub, senior managing director of Citi Habitats. ''The neighborhoods below 23rd Street were the most affected, and that trend will continue in 2007.''  Still, it has been a shock for many residents of the two complexes, where nearly three-quarters of the 11,200 apartments have regulated rents at a third to half of the market rate. Traditionally, tenants moved in and stayed for years and even decades.  MetLife built the complexes in 1947 with state and city subsidies after it agreed to maintain below-market rents for 25 years. An apartment can be decontrolled, however, after it becomes vacant, or if the rent reaches $2,000 a month and the existing tenants' household income rises above $175,000 for two consecutive years. About four years ago, MetLife began renovating vacant apartments, which allowed the company to take the units out of rent regulation.  Many of the rent-stabilized tenants feared that they would somehow be ousted from Stuyvesant Town or Peter Cooper Village by a new owner after MetLife announced last year that it was selling the complexes.  But their rents are protected by state law. It turns out, some residents say, that the market-rate tenants, who account for 27 percent of the apartments, are the ones who should have been concerned about the future.  ''We've heard a lot of complaints about this,'' said Alvin Doyle, president of the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association.  One tenant at Peter Cooper said she had decided to renew her lease for a year, despite a 33 percent rent increase to $4,300 for her two-bedroom apartment. But she will be moving out in 2008.  ''I don't want to leave,'' said the woman, who insisted on anonymity because she has not yet signed her lease. ''But I can't afford it. I've got a kid going to college in a year and a half.''  Mr. Doyle said he was also getting complaints from rent-stabilized tenants who had received letters from the landlord saying that their lease would not be renewed because the apartment was not their primary residence. Under state law, the landlord is permitted to evict a tenant who is using a rent-regulated apartment as a pied-\u00e0-tere or illegally subletting it.  Jack Lester, the longtime lawyer for the tenants association, said the landlord was trying to evict tenants who own any property outside the complex, including vacation homes or investment properties, in an attempt to ''bludgeon people out of their homes.'' MetLife did the same thing, he said, but the practice seems to be accelerating under Tishman Speyer. Mr. Lester said he now has 38 nonprimary-residence cases, up from an average of 18 a year.  Mr. Speyer said that legal tenants had nothing to worry about.  ",

            "text": "  MONTAUK, the hamlet on the end of Long Island's South Fork, has been a rustic un-Hampton summer destination for more than 50 years. But two new projects suggest that Montauk may be heading for year-round status, and the recent sale of a former celebrity retreat has also put a spotlight on the hamlet.  A new condop -- a co-op complex with condominium-style rules -- is under construction in Montauk on the site of the Panoramic View Hotel on Old Montauk Highway. The property, still operating as a hotel, has more than 1,000 feet of sandy beach on the Atlantic Ocean. The condop is a complete renovation of the hotel.  The developer, Distinctive Ventures, hopes to attract young Manhattan families who want a year-round getaway, but not the bustle and hype of East Hampton and Southampton, according to Adam Manson, a company spokesman.  When completed, the 75-unit complex, to be called Panoramic Villas, will have a full-service concierge, an outdoor heated pool and a fitness center. A mixture of two-, three- and four-bedroom duplexes and some triplexes, ranging in size from 2,000 to 4,000 square feet, is planned. If buyers don't have time to decorate, Mr. Manson said, they can choose from a variety of furniture packages and accessories, including ''everything from table cutlery to napkins in the kitchen ready to use.''  The units, which will start at $1.5 million, will also have oak floors, hot tubs and flat-panel televisions, and granite counters and expensive appliances, Mr. Manson added.  Buyers will purchase shares in the complex, but there are no board approvals, and owners can sublet the units anytime, Mr. Manson said.  Distinctive Ventures plans to start selling the first 27 units of the project this spring, and the units will be ready by fall, Mr. Manson said.  The company believes that wealthier second-home buyers who want year-round services are heading for Montauk. Clues came from the company's research of Montauk's rental market, Mr. Manson said.  ''A lot of rentals in the last few seasons were longer term,'' Mr. Manson said. ''People want to own out there, but there's very little that is brand new.''  Former Warhol Retreat Is Sold For $27 Million  When the pop artist Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey, his manager and film collaborator, bought a 20-acre estate on the ocean in Montauk in 1971 for $225,000, they thought it was a good investment. That's what Mr. Morrissey said last September when the remaining 5.6 acres was on the market for $40 million.  Perhaps that overestimated price how good an investment it was. Earlier this month, Millard S. Drexler, chief executive of the clothing company J. Crew, bought the estate for much less: $27 million, according to Paul Brennan of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who handled the sale.  (The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts donated the other 15 acres to the Nature Conservancy after the artist's death in 1987. The conservancy created the Andy Warhol Preserve in 1993.)  The sold property, called Eothen, ancient Greek for ''at first light,'' sits in a valley among high cliffs in an area known as the Montauk moorlands. Mr. Morrissey listed it with several different real estate firms over the last five years, originally asking $50 million.  Eothen includes a compound of five Colonial Revival-style houses, a horse stable and a three-car garage. All of the houses have spectacular views of the Atlantic Ocean.  Mr. Drexler scouted Eothen for a friend who was interested, Mr. Brennan said, but then bought it himself when the friend passed on it. ''He said, 'It's like a painting,' a very unique property,'' Mr. Brennan said.  The five homes, with 15 bedrooms in all, were built in 1931 for the Church family, descendants of a founder of the Church & Dwight Company, makers of Arm & Hammer baking soda. Seven of the bedrooms are in the main house, a rustic wood-paneled structure with blue shuttered windows and a great room with two fireplaces, exposed beams and a vaulted ceiling.  ''I would say he has very good taste'' to buy the estate, said Tina Fredericks, the East Hampton broker who sold Mr. Morrissey and Warhol the estate in 1971. As for the price, $40 million ''always seemed rather high,'' Ms. Fredericks said.  A Hotel Project Recalls A '20s Developer's Dream  A developer is renovating the 1929 Shepherd's Neck Inn, a 65-room Montauk hotel, and plans to convert it into a year-round ''resort hotel'' called Sol\u00e9 East. (Sole is Italian for ''sun,'' although the Italians don't use an accent mark for the noun.)  The hotel will have 60 rooms on 2.5 landscaped acres when it opens in the spring, according to Tom Feeley, an owner of the development firm Wavestone Properties. Wavestone has also bought the Shepherd's Beach hotel nearby and an adjacent five acres of vacant land, where the zoning was recently changed to permit residential development.  Wavestone has built condominiums and rental buildings in Jersey City and Hoboken, N.J., but this is its first project on Long Island.  Sol\u00e9 East will be one of two branded hotels, Mr. Feeley said. The first, called Sol\u00e9 on the Ocean, is a condominium hotel in Sunny Isles, Fla., which offers owners hotel-like services, including a concierge and housekeeping, and the ability to rent out their units as hotel rooms.  The look and feel of the Montauk hotel will come from Stephane Dupoux, whose interior design firm has designed highly stylized bars, nightclubs and hotels, including Buddha Bar and Cielo in Manhattan and the Gansevoort Beach Club hotel in South Beach.  The new hotel, Mr. Feeley said, will have high-definition flat-screen televisions, whitewashed walls, restored hardwood floors, cedar platform beds and black slate tile bathrooms with a large window in the wall separating the shower from the hotel room.  For winter visitors, there will be a 2,000-square-foot wine cellar and the developer will update the wood-burning fireplaces in the restaurant and in the lobby, Mr. Feeley said.  The Shepherd's Neck Inn was originally called Montauk Arms. It was built by Carl Fisher, the developer who, with a partner, created Miami Beach from swampland in the 1920s.  After that success, Fisher tried to build a similar resort in Montauk. A devastating hurricane and the stock market crash of 1929 left Fisher financially ruined, but not before he had planned an entire community in Montauk for the wealthy and partially created some of it, including private homes, grand hotels, a yacht club, a school and office buildings.  The inn was to serve as apartments for the managers of his resorts in Montauk, according to a history provided by the Montauk Library. ''We feel a connection with Carl Fisher's original concept and his connection to both markets where we are opening, in Miami and Montauk,'' Mr. Feeley said.  In the Region | Long Island  ",

            "text": "  WHEN Andrew C. Friedman, a Manhattan architect known for his elaborate (and expensive) classical residences, chose a nondescript little brick and fake-stone building in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn to redesign, he already knew the kind of urban couple he imagined there -- and they were very different from his usual clients.  No, this imaginary makeover was not for the people who commissioned the eight-room Park Avenue pied-\u00e0-terre that Mr. Friedman is currently working on, nor the guy with the town house who wants his new ballroom to take up an entire floor.  The house at 9A Pulaski Street -- listed at a $695,000, negotiable -- would be ''for a very hip couple without a great deal of money,'' he said, ''who might start out by renting out the bottom floor to pay a chunk of the mortgage, and then, later, take over the whole house and maybe eventually add on.''  So far, so good.  But when Mr. Friedman and his assistant Krzysztof A. Nowak (known as Kris) got out of a taxi on Pulaski Street two weeks ago, their faces showed only disappointment, with a tinge of horror. ''I'm wondering what we have gotten ourselves into,'' Mr. Friedman, a partner in the Studio for Civil Architecture, said as he climbed the slightly off-kilter stairs to the slightly off-kilter second floor. ''Well, we wanted a challenge.''  The second floor, although bright enough, was a jumble of little rooms; the only redeeming factor was an ornate wooden parquet floor, a mystery in such an ordinary 1920s building. But the views were intriguing: over the tops of equally short buildings, over the new Home Depot a block away and over what seemed like miles of Brooklyn's cityscape.  Things started getting interesting on the first floor.  When the caretaker opened the door to its separate entrance, Mr. Friedman broke into his first smile. ''Wow,'' he said, ''this is the place the couple would like to live in, not the upstairs.''  The first floor has high ceilings, perhaps 11 feet, and opens out into a wonderful wide loft space, even if it is a dark one. In the back of the big room, a table was set for four, complete with lace tablecloth, cloth napkins and red plastic roses. (We ignored the Tasty Banana mouse trap on the linoleum floor.) Mr. Friedman went farther back, into the kitchen, freshly covered with Formica. Behind the kitchen, in a wing added much later, he found a bedroom balanced on a platform about a foot higher than the hallway.  And then, through a door, was a well-proportioned backyard that could definitely benefit from a landscape designer -- or even a few shrubs from that Home Depot nearby.  Standing in the backyard and looking toward the rear of the house, Mr. Friedman was clearly planning something. ''I see a roof terrace,'' he said, ''or maybe adding another story, which would make it the same height as the building next to it.''  Meanwhile, Mr. Nowak, wielding his digital camera, had left the house for an exploration of the neighborhood. He returned, excited by his discovery of what lay around the corner, on Nostrand Avenue.  ''We were wondering what this building had been, why the first-floor facade had been blocked up,'' he said. ''Just come around the corner and see. This building has brothers and sisters. What we have here is one small piece of a whole neighborhood.''  He had discovered that the house on Pulaski Street was one of perhaps a dozen ''twin'' buildings, built with the identical brick diamond-shaped ornament and twinned double windows on the second floor, stretching across the whole Nostrand Avenue blockfront and reaching down Pulaski.  The house at 9A Pulaski originally had a first-floor storefront, with a large shop window and a recessed corner door supported by an iron column. The shopkeeper -- a grocer or dry-goods merchant, perhaps -- probably lived above the store, and knowing that immediately gave the building a certain warmth, a certain context -- even a certain future.  ''I knew if we came out here we'd find something, something we couldn't have predicted,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''Now we just have to figure out a way to restore this sort of detailing in a contemporary manner -- and have some fun doing it.''  Two weeks later, in his SoHo office, Mr. Friedman, joined by his partner, Donald M. Rattner, as well as Mr. Nowak, put a silvery disk into a giant-screen computer and showed off their automated rendering of the project. As one image metamorphosed into another, the many surprises of the plans for this intriguing building became evident.  What was that in the backyard? A weatherproof movie screen. Where do you watch it from? The new bleachers on the new terrace off the second floor, of course. What's that on top of the second floor? The new third floor. And above that were saw-toothed skylights that look like an alligator's back.  The team had decided to keep intact the upper part of the building -- the original facade, with its broken pediment that shouts the mid-1920s as loudly as a flapper's cloche hat -- but to add a 21st-century rendition of the shop window, which would provide much more light. There, too, is the corner door supported by the pillar.  It is not a true restoration, a slavish following of each and every detail, but a streamlined version, more in keeping with the streamlined interior.  Inside, Mr. Friedman and his team created what Corbusier might have called a machine for living in Brooklyn, a slick residence for the couple he had always kept in mind, and even a child or two, depending on how the spaces would be used.  In terms of structure, the team knocked off the ill-fitting rear addition and moved the kitchen to face the street, where the newly created ''shop window'' has translucent glass, allowing in light but keeping the neighborhood out. In the back is the garden, with its movie screen and plantings.  ''What is rare in town houses -- you won't find it in classic brownstones -- is that you can just walk out to the back garden from the living room,'' Mr. Rattner said. ''You don't have to walk up from the ground floor, or down a staircase from the parlor floor.''  The first-floor bedroom has been lost, but upstairs there are more, either one or two on the second floor, depending on their size. Then, on the third floor is the new master bedroom and a 16-by-20-foot room, facing north and the back of the building. This could be a studio, an office or a playroom.  There is a new half bath on the first floor, one or two bathrooms on the second floor and another bath on the top floor. In the setback of the new third floor, a front-facing terrace has been added, shaded by a wood pergola.  When balanced against the creativity of the plan, and its complexity, the estimates for the transformation seem moderate and not out of line with Mr. Friedman's imaginary owners.  The first phase would be minimal, costing perhaps $20,000, and including the demolition of a few ungainly Sheetrock walls downstairs -- plus some painting and refurnishing. If the out-of-kilter stairs are structurally sound -- something that would be learned in any structural inspection before the closing -- the architects suggested that they be left alone, for now.  The second phase, costing perhaps $225,000, would include completely renovating the first and second floors, turning the building into a one-family house for the couple. The third phase, at about $180,000, would add the top floor and terrace.  (Jerry Minsky, one of the listing agents, said that if the second floor were rented out much as it is now, the new owners would have mortgage payments of about $1,600 a month, at today's rates, assuming a 10 percent down payment. If the owners decided to rent out both floors until they could afford to move into the whole house, he said the property would generate a positive cash flow.)  The three architects, buoyed by their discovery of the block's common style, think that the renovation of this one house might be only the beginning of the neighborhood's rebirth.  ''This could be part of a bigger story,'' said Mr. Friedman as his colleagues nodded vigorously. ''What we're doing is designing a prototype that might catch fire and go around the block. The whole block might be restored.''  Mr. Nowak opened a large black portfolio. In it was a rendering of what the entire block of Nostrand Avenue might look like with trees and with each building restored with the same type of contemporary storefront as the town house on Pulaski Street.  Some could house restaurants, Mr. Friedman said, and some might be boutiques. And in a flight of fancy that would warm any preservationist's heart, these small businesses might even have their owners living above them again.  But what about the existing owners? What about the fact that a church congregation makes its home in the corner building -- a building that, in the rendering, is drawn with bittersweet-orange canvas awnings on its Pulaski Street side?  ''Developers can accomplish anything,'' Mr. Friedman said, laughing. ''You'd be amazed!''  THE SPECS  Sketch Pad focuses on an apartment, loft, house or shack now for sale that has unrealized potential. Each month, a different architect or designer is asked to create a vision of what the place might look like. There are no guarantees that the plans would be approved by co-op boards, municipal building departments or planning boards. But they can help real estate shoppers learn to see past ugly paint, too-small kitchens and a warren of rooms.  ARCHITECTS  Andrew C. Friedman, Donald M. Rattner and Krzysztof A.

            "text": "  SOMETIMES, developers and architects say, the biggest design problem with a new Manhattan residential building is figuring out how it will fit onto its lot. Two luxury condominiums, one planned for East 51st Street and the other for East 13th, are currently presenting a challenge.  The 21-story condo that will rise at 211 East 51st Street, between Second and Third Avenues, is set to contain 72 units, ranging from studios to three-bedrooms. Pricing hasn't been set yet, because the building is under contract. Uned Associates, the current owner, based in Manhattan, is selling to Allied Properties of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The closing is scheduled for this week, said Tim Ziss, Allied's principal.  At first, Mr. Ziss had planned to demolish the 15-story condo currently on the site, leaving only its metal beams, concrete floors and foundation, and use those elements as the groundwork for something larger, thereby creating the maximum number of apartments permitted at the site.  But this plan was hamstrung by the fact that the property straddles a commercial zone and a residential zone, each with different building height requirements.  A potentially lopsided roofline wasn't what worried Mr. Ziss. It was the fact that height caps on the residential eastern half of the building would severely curtail how many units he could create.  ''It was extremely complicated,'' he said. ''Even the zoning experts had a hard time tweaking this one.''  The solution, proposed by the architect David Mandl, was to add medical offices to the building's second and third floors. By law, if commercial tenants serve some kind of public benefit, as doctors do, the building can grow taller -- in this case, on the commercial side. Thus, more square footage can be wrung from the project.  ''I've been practicing under my own shingle since 1980, and this is one of the more exotic zoning situations I've dealt with,'' Mr. Mandl said. ''But I think it will turn out to be an elegant project.''  For the A Building, a luxury condo at 425 East 13th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A, the hitch came in the form of an unusual T-shaped lot that extends the width of a block -- so that the T's base fronts on 14th Street.  The size may seem advantageous, leaving plenty of room for extra apartments. But according to John Cetra, the architect, zoning dictates that any new structures be massed along the lot's edges, so that an unbroken line of buildings faces the sidewalk.  So the building is divided in two. The East 13th Street portion, with 150 feet of frontage, will have 77 units, and the East 14th Street side, with 25 feet of frontage, will have 7 units. Prices range from $600,000 to $2.5 million, and 35 percent of the units have sold, said Robert Kaliner, president of the Ascend Group, a Manhattan-based developer.  To avoid leaving a potentially unattractive doughnut hole of unused space in the lot's center, Mr. Cetra decided to pack it with trees and grasses, creating a courtyard that complements the 5,000-square-foot roof deck, which will have similar landscaping and a 50-foot pool.  Another snag: East 13th Street sits at a slightly lower elevation than East 14th, which means that the glass walkway traversing the courtyard to connect the building's two areas must slope down, Mr. Cetra said.  ''Organizing the lower floors was sort of a puzzle,'' he added, explaining that he had never worked on a lot like this before, or on a block-through project. ''It added a lot of drama.''

            "text": "  WHEN Annabelle Selldorf designed the Urban Glass House, a condominium building in TriBeCa, in 2005, she shared billing with Philip Johnson, who had died early that year. (The design was inspired by Mr. Johnson's famous Glass House in Connecticut.) Their faces stared down, jointly, from a giant billboard.  With her latest condo building, on 11th Avenue at 24th Street, Ms. Selldorf is sharing the spotlight with a gizmo: an elevator that will allow apartment owners to drive their cars into garages adjoining their high-rise apartments. ''For a client who is haunted by paparazzi,'' said Leonard Steinberg, the marketing director for the building, ''it is a dream come true.''  Fourteen of the 16 units will have the elevated garages, pending city approval, Mr. Steinberg said. The apartments, which average 2,500 square feet and are expected to be completed in mid-2008, will sell for ''the mid fives,'' Mr. Steinberg said, by which he meant around $5 million.  The developer is Young Woo & Associates, which helped create the Chelsea Arts Tower, a commercial condominium, around the corner.  Ms. Selldorf is best known for designing the Neue Galerie, on East 86th Street, and expensive private homes. She was chosen for the project, Mr. Steinberg said, because she knows how wealthy clients live.  The base of the 18-story structure will be clad in gunmetal-colored terra cotta. At the fourth floor, the terra cotta will give way to brushed stainless steel, some of which will be visible from inside the apartments.  In addition to direct Hudson River views, the units will have teak floors and other expensive finishes. ''We don't want the building to be known for just one thing,'' Ms. Selldorf said, referring to the auto elevator.  And yet that thing is impossible to ignore, suggesting as it does a futuristic city with vertical as well as horizontal mobility.  Ms. Selldorf said she had gotten the idea for the elevators from the surrounding neighborhood, where many older warehouse buildings contain elevators large enough for trucks to shuttle goods up and down. (Martha Stewart was once photographed driving directly into her office in the Starrett-Lehigh Building at 26th Street between 11th and 12th.) ''In terms of technology, it's actually pretty primitive,'' Ms. Selldorf said.  Residents will drive into the elevator on 11th Avenue, and exit it on 24th Street. Luckily for the developer, the existing buildings on the site, now demolished, ''already had a lot of curb cuts,'' Mr. Steinberg said.  For residents without cars, the garages might serve other functions, such as wine ''cellars'' with easy van access. ''People who have garages on their houses don't always use them for cars,'' Ms. Selldorf said.  Ms. Selldorf, an Audi driver, recognizes that the car of choice for many New Yorkers is a taxi. Will cabdrivers be able to take residents right up to their apartments? ''Maybe,'' she said, ''but only if you tip a lot.''  POSTINGS  ",

            "text": "  IN the 1890s, Louis Seitz built three singular apartment houses in Brooklyn: the Imperial, at Pacific Street and Bedford Avenue; the Alhambra, at Nostrand Avenue and Macon Street; and the Renaissance, at Nostrand and Hancock Street.  As decades passed, each building went to a different owner. But all followed the downward path that overtook much of Brooklyn; a century later, they were disintegrating.  Under the supervision of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, they have now been rebuilt by developers who have remained faithful to the originals, at least on the exterior. The buildings in their infancy catered to a wealthy clientele, but today most of the apartments are for moderate- or low-income tenants.  Born in 1860, Mr. Seitz left school at 16 and worked in a wholesale business of some sort before going into real estate in 1884.  The masterpiece of his trio, built in 1889, was the wild and woolly Alhambra. The blocklong building was set back 15 feet from Nostrand Avenue, with six towers, arcaded balconies, a garden and a croquet lawn. It mixed several styles, and in 1890, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle said it ''might best be described as Morrisian,'' an allusion to the pyrotechnics of Mr. Seitz's architect, Montrose Morris. The five-story building, which cost $200,000, had a resident engineer and 32 apartments of 8 to 10 rooms. It was instantly one of Brooklyn's best apartment houses.  Two years later, Mr. Seitz and Mr. Morris completed two near twins: the Imperial, several blocks south in Crown Heights, and the Renaissance, a block north of the Alhambra.  According to an 1892 issue of The Eagle, Mr. Seitz told Mr. Morris to prepare plans for the Imperial regardless of cost, in order to make ''a monument handsome beyond compare.'' And that monument, at Pacific and Bedford, is wonderfully rambunctious, its triple outsize turrets and pointed roofs like the three musketeers backed into a corner, swords flailing.  Although the exterior walls meet at right angles, the plot is slightly acute -- perhaps only 80 degrees instead of the usual 90 -- which animates the facade in a way seen in few other buildings. The whole is dominated by triple-height arches, topped by an irregular attic story, its slate roofs crowded together as if jockeying for position.  The Alhambra is in a moody palette of orange and brown and red, while the Imperial turned the corner of the new Renaissance style, airy and light in soft yellow and buff brick and terra cotta. Two-story-high fluted columns give the later building a Roman pomp. In 1892, The Eagle called it ''an architectural dream in cream and white,'' generally patterned after McKim, Mead & White's Hotel Imperial, which once stood at 32nd Street and Broadway in Manhattan.  The 1892 Renaissance, at Nostrand Avenue and Hancock Street, is essentially the same as the Imperial, although less operatic.  An 1893 book, ''The Eagle and Brooklyn,'' singled out Mr. Seitz's efforts, noting his ''discriminating artistic sense'' and saying he had revolutionized the Brooklyn apartment market. Andrew Scott Dolkart, who has studied the career of Montrose Morris extensively, calls him one of Brooklyn's great 19th-century architects.  In an 1899 account, The Eagle called the Imperial ''one of the finest apartments in Brooklyn''; in 1901, it reported that the 25 seven-room apartments each rented for $60 a month. According to the 1905 New York State census, tenants had occupations like lawyer, exporter, engineer and stockbroker.  By the 1970s, all three buildings were on the skids. The city took possession of the Imperial in 1979, because its taxes had not been paid. An article in The New York Times in 1983 estimated the building's expenses at $67,000 a year, while reporting that the rent roll could not have exceeded $57,000.  The buildings were designated landmarks in 1986, but within a decade the Renaissance was vacant, the Alhambra had only stores as occupants (much of its roof had collapsed from a fire), and the Imperial had only a few tenants.  Rebuilding work on the Alhambra and the Renaissance took place in the 1990s, but the Imperial did not reopen until last October, after a $6.3 million gut renovation similar to the those at the Alhambra and the Imperial.  There is no longer anything historic about any of the interiors, which are plain white and could be in a postwar building on Third Avenue in Manhattan. But in the Imperial some of the two- and three-bedroom apartments retain some original character because they occupy the turrets. A fifth-floor apartment at the northwest corner, with distant views of the Manhattan skyline, is now available at $1,800 a month at market rate, or as low as $700 for prospective tenants who meet certain income guidelines.  Outside, the building's developer, Larry Hirschfield, the president of ELH Management, has delivered interesting results. The masonry has been cleaned, but not too harshly, preserving the dings and nicks of time that give a building character. The slate roofs were kept intact, not rebuilt in modern materials, which would have removed more of the building's patina.  Mr. Hirschfield also had to reproduce much of the copper work in the triple-height window bays. But instead of either cleaning the old copper to look new, or patinating the replacement copper to look old, he left old and new together, so some parts are aged green and others are shiny brown -- a bit odd, but that's how old buildings often look in real life.  So the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has saved the shells of Mr. Seitz's three signature buildings from disaster and now can make some claim on the same kind of revolution he created in the 1890s.

It is with profound sadness that the JCC on the Palisades mourns the loss of Leonard Rubin, a great friend and remarkable man, who was one of the visionary founders of the JCC and epitomized the very essence of a world Jewish leader.

A man of intellectual vibrancy, practical wisdom and deep ethical commitment, Lenny was an extraordinary leader, and for more than half a century, he was dedicated to promoting Jewish scholarship, identity and culture. He accomplished everything he set out to do with far-reaching and innovative results. A leader of heroic magnitude, Leonard served the JCC in many capacities. He was a founding member, President from 1966-1970, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, an active board member for decades and a driving force behind many JCC programs. His generous philanthropic support has been immeasurable and will never be forgotten. When the JCC sought to build its current facility in Tenafly, Leonard led the capital campaign which transformed a vision into reality. Believing that Jewish education was paramount, he established the first Judaic-Scholar-inResidence program at our JCC which now serves as a model for JCCs across the nation. Other programs that Lenny and his wife, Syril, generously established and supported include the nursery school, which bears their name, the Adult Reach Center for seniors with Alzheimers and dementia, a Teen Scholarship to Israel and the annual JCC Rubin Run. Leonard was also instrumental in countless Jewish organizations. He served as president of the World Confederation of Jewish Community Centers, as a Board member of the JCC Association, where he received the prestigious Community Builders Award. He also served on the Board of Directors of Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, as Chairman of the Board of the Jewish Home and Rehabilitation Center, as President of the Jewish Home at Rockleigh, as a President of UJA of Englewood and he was a driving force for the establishment of what is currently known as the UJA NNJ.

We treasure the many memories we share with wife and true partner Syril, adoring children, loving family, and a multitude of admiring and appreciative friends. With heartfelt sadness we will ever miss Lenny's unique and generous spirit, courageous leadership and exceptional wisdom. Love Always, Eleanor and Ed Epstein, Sandra and Arnold Gold, Bill Lippman, Barbara and Norman Seiden  $(6$)RUBIN--Leonard. Dear Lenny, with your unwavering generosity and vision, you have built a house and made it a home, for thousands in your community. Your leadership will be missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Syrile and the entire Rubin family. Amir and Joan Cohen Ilan and Iris Cohen  $(6$)RUBIN--Leonard. It is with profound sadness that the JCC on the Palisades mourns the loss of Leonard Rubin, a great friend and remarkable man, who was one of the visionary founders of the JCC and epitomized the very essence of a world Jewish leader. A man of many passions, Mr. Rubin demonstrated extraordinary devotion to Jewish education and to Jewish continuity. He initiated important efforts that touched the lives of people around the world. A man of intellectual vibrancy, practical wisdom and deep ethical commitment, Lenny was an extraordinary leader, and for more than half a century, he was dedicated to promoting Jewish scholarship, identity and culture. He accomplished everything he set out to do with far-reaching and innovative results. A leader of heroic magnitude, Leonard served the JCC in many capacities. He was a founding member, President from 1966-1970, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, an active board member for decades and a driving force behind many JCC programs. His generous philanthropic support has been immeasurable and will never be forgotten. When the JCC sought to build its current facility in Tenafly, Leonard led the capital campaign which transformed a vision into reality. Believing that Jewish education was paramount, he established the first Judaic-Scholar-inResidence program at our JCC which now serves as a model for JCCs across the nation. Other programs that Lenny and his wife, Syril, generously established and supported include the nursery school, which bears their name, the Adult Reach Center for seniors with Alzheimers and dementia, a Teen Scholarship to Israel and the annual JCC Rubin Run. Leonard was also instrumental in countless Jewish organizations. He served as president of the World Confederation of Jewish Community Centers, as a Board member of the JCC Association, where he received the prestigious Community Builders Award. He also served on the Board of Directors of Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, as Chairman of the Board of the Jewish Home and Rehabilitation Center, as President of the Jewish Home at Rockleigh, as a President of UJA of Englewood and he was a driving force for the establishment of what is currently known as the UJA NNJ. He was a recipient of numerous awards, including the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Appeal for Human Relations Award from the American Jewish Committee, the NJ Y Camps Harry S. Feller Memorial Award, and the Anti - Defamation Leagues Torch of Liberty Award. Our dear friend Lenny, will be remembered for his extraordinary generosity and commitment to the JCC on the Palisades, the Jewish community, the community at large and for inspiring generations of leaders. He possessed the rare gift of greatness and left an indelible mark on all our lives. We send our sincerest condolences to his wife Syril, his children, Daniel, the current President of the JCC on the Palisades, Robert, Toby, Leslie and Mark, his 12 grandchildren, Jed, Jamie, Tali, Sharon, Rebecca, Rachel, Julie, Alison, Sadie, Samantha, Dora, Jacob and one great-grandchild, Judah. He was deeply loved and will be sorely missed. May his memory be for a blessing. Funeral service will take place Sunday, January 28, at 11:00 am at the JCC on the Palisades, 411 East Clinton Avenue, Tenafly, NJ. 201-569-7900.

Born May 1, 1952, in Brookline, Massachusetts, she graduated with Honors from both Radcliffe College (1973) and Harvard Law School (1979). After law school, she worked in the Carter White House for the President's Commission on an Agenda for the 1980s, a prescient 12 volume exploration of the trends which have dominated the ensuing decades. In 1982, she became a program officer at the Revson Foundation, where over a 25 year career she built alliances with Americas major foundations to produce some of the most effective initiatives of the period. She is survived by a cherished husband, John Sexton, President of New York University; a treasured daughter and son, Katie Sexton and Jed Sexton; a beloved daughter-in-law, Danielle DeCrette; three wonderful granddaughters, Julia (five), Ava (two) and Nathalie (two); a sister, Donna Eskind and her husband Jeff, of Nashville and their three children, David, Matthew and Sara; and a brother, Philip, presently the United States Ambassador to Bolivia.

Revson Foundation, she was second to none as a force for understanding, progress and the common good. From her creativity, to her conceptualizing and supporting breakthrough documentaries, to her dedication to ending discrimination and empowering the poor, to her commitment to dialogue across race and religion, to her dedication to Jewish heritage, Lisa was, for all she touched, simultaneously leader, role model, dear friend and counselor. Even as we, her family, long for her continued physical presence, we vow to carry her and her love with us forever. Born May 1, 1952, in Brookline, Massachusetts, she graduated with Honors from both Radcliffe College (1973) and Harvard Law School (1979). After law school, she worked in the Carter White House for the President's Commission on an Agenda for the 1980s, a prescient 12 volume exploration of the trends which have dominated the ensuing decades. In 1982, she became a program officer at the Revson Foundation, where over a 25 year career she built alliances with Americas major foundations to produce some of the most effective initiatives of the period. She is survived by a cherished husband, John Sexton, President of New York University; a treasured daughter and son, Katie Sexton and Jed Sexton; a beloved daughter-in-law, Danielle DeCrette; three wonderful granddaughters, Julia (five), Ava (two) and Nathalie (two); a sister, Donna Eskind and her husband Jeff, of Nashville and their three children, David, Matthew and Sara; and a brother, Philip, presently the United States Ambassador to Bolivia. A memorial service will be held in late February. This week, the family will receive friends at 37 Washington Square West on Wednesday and Thursday, January 24 and 25, between 3:00pm and 5:00pm and between 7:00pm and 9:00pm; and on Friday, January 26, between 2:00pm and 4:00pm. The family asks that in lieu of flowers contributions be made to the Lisa Goldberg Fellowship Fund at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service. Checks can be sent care of Dean Ellen Schall.  GOLDBERG--Lisa. The trustees, staff and volunteers of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), licensee of Thirteen/WNET and WLIW New York, mourn the tragic loss of our long time friend and supporter Lisa Goldberg. A remarkable woman whose intelligence, compassion and quiet grace informed her every action, Lisa brought a practical and deeply humanitarian vision to her many undertakings, and her very presence could fill a room with a sense of hope and possibility. For more than two decades at the Charles Revson Foundation, first as program officer and final as president, she contributed her rare wisdom to a long series of philanthropic efforts that have benefited millions of people. The entire public television community will be forever grateful for her generous assistance in bringing to life such landmark projects as Bill Moyer's Genesis: A Living Conversation, Henry Hampton's Eyes on the Prize, and the innovative Heritage Interactive. We extend our deepest sympathies to her husband, John Sexton, their children, Katherine Lodgen Sexton and Jed Sexton, as well as to Lisa's sister and brother, and the rest of her extended family. Her soul infused the world around her and there it will live on. James S. Tisch Chairman William F. Baker Chief Executive  GOLDBERG--Lisa E.

            "fulltext": "Thrift is often the best catalyst for culinary invention. Penny-pinching dishes like panzanella, poule au pot and beef rag\u00f9 were all responses of wily cooks to hard times. Likewise, the recipe for these pork chops with rye-bread stuffing, which The Times published in 1959, was billed as a dinner on the cheap. Pork chops are an inexpensive cut of meat, and bread stuffing was used, as it has been for hundreds of years, to stretch the portions.  Using rye bread, with its strong grain flavor, and seasoning it with saut\u00e9ed onion, garlic, parsley and caraway, give the stuffing distinction far beyond its means. From here the technique is pure 1950s: the chops are browned in the oven, and a sauce is made with the brown but succulent drippings. The result is very ... brown. But toothsome -- like a better-dressed cousin of pastrami on rye.  Nowadays supermarket pork chops have become so thin and industrially produced that they yield a dish with the texture of particle board. It's worth the effort to find a butcher who carries good, fat-marbled chops and who can cut them thickly -- an inch is best. (Also, I've reworked the recipe a bit, cooking the meat covered in the oven to keep it moist, then finishing it under the broiler.)  I gave the recipe to Marco Canora, the chef at Hearth in New York, to try, and he was surprised by how much he liked the pork chops. ''I'm not just saying this,'' he added. ''They were delicious.''  When Canora modernized the recipe, he turned to an even cheaper cut: pork belly. First he brined it, then braised it in a combination of thick, cloudy apple cider and stock infused with garlic, thyme and caraway. ''I've always liked cabbage with pork,'' he said, so he also braised a little red cabbage with apple, mustard seeds, cider vinegar and more caraway. The finished dish -- a square of meat and a tangle of wilted red cabbage shored up with braising juices (pink on red on brown) -- is an intoxicating blend of pork, caraway and cider vinegar. It's pastrami on rye's urbane, wholesome cousin.  On first read, Canora's recipe is cheflike and daunting. But while its steps stretch over three days -- brining, braising, finishing -- the total amount of work involved is little more than that for the pork chops. Still skeptical? The night Canora put the dish on his menu, it sold out in half an hour.  1959: Pork Chops With Rye-Bread Stuffing  This recipe appeared in The Times in an article by Craig Claiborne.  6 bone-in, 1-inch-thick loin chops  3 tablespoons butter  1 medium onion, finely chopped  1 large clove garlic, minced  3 1/2 cups soft rye-bread crumbs  (a mix of large and small pieces, without caraway seeds)  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds  3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley  Salt and pepper  1 large egg, lightly beaten with 3 tablespoons water  1 tablespoon flour  3/4 cup chicken broth.  1. Have a butcher cut a generous pocket in each chop or a slit to butterfly the chops for stuffing.  2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a saut\u00e9 pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a large bowl and add the bread crumbs, caraway seeds, parsley, teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Add the beaten egg and mix with a fork until blended.  3. Fill the chops with the stuffing, then seal the pockets with toothpicks. Season on all sides with salt and pepper. Arrange in a braising pan or other shallow baking dish fitted with a lid. Bake, covered, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, not the stuffing, reaches 155 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes.  4. Remove the lid and place the pan under the broiler just until the chops are browned and the temperature in the thickest part of the meat is 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm.  5. Set the braising pan on the stove over medium heat and reduce the pan juices to a thick glaze. Add the remaining tablespoon butter. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer, scraping up the pan drippings, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; strain. Season to taste. Serve the pork chops with the sauce. Serves 6.  Brined-and-Braised Pork Belly With Caraway  By Marco Canora, the chef and co-owner of Hearth  For the brine:  1 cup caraway seeds  3 tablespoons fennel seeds  3 tablespoons whole black peppercorns  3 tablespoons coriander seeds  1 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more as needed  1 cup packed dark brown sugar  6 cloves garlic, crushed  2 cups cider vinegar  2 pounds pork belly (center cut)  For the braise:  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons canola oil  1 carrot, chopped  1 stalk celery, chopped  1 onion, chopped  4 cloves garlic, crushed  6 sprigs thyme  3 tablespoons caraway seeds, toasted  4 cups apple cider  4 cups chicken broth.  1. Two days before serving the pork, prepare the brine: In a large skillet over low heat, toast the caraway seeds. Cool and grind in a spice grinder. In a large plastic container, combine the caraway, fennel, peppercorns, coriander, salt, brown sugar, garlic, cider vinegar and 4 cups water. Add the pork, cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.  2. The next day, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Remove the pork from the brine and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper. In a braising pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the pork and brown on all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add the carrot, celery, onion, garlic, thyme and 2 tablespoons toasted caraway seeds to the pan. Brown the vegetables until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return the pork to the pan, skin side up. Pour in the apple cider and enough broth to cover the meat by three-fourths. Bring to a boil, then cover and braise in the oven until the pork is very tender, about 2 hours. Cool the pork in its cooking liquid and refrigerate overnight.  3. The next day, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Scrape off and discard excess fat from the braising liquid. Remove the pork and discard loose gelatin. Cut the pork into serving pieces and place in a wide saut\u00e9 pan with a heatproof handle. Bring the braising liquid to a boil and reduce by about two-thirds, or until it lightly coats the back of a spoon; strain. Pour just enough liquid over the pork to submerge halfway. Sprinkle with the remaining caraway seeds, then place the pan in the oven and heat through, basting occasionally. Top pork with sauce and serve with braised cabbage, a recipe for which can be found at nytimes.com/magazine. Serves 4.",

            "fulltext": "FISH served with red wine has long stopped being a culinary faux pas. But for this pairing I wanted the fish to be in red wine, not just with it.  Just days after we tasted the alluring 2003 wines from St.-\u00c9milion, I was at a dinner party where bottles of fine Bordeaux were poured.  One of the dishes served with them was a classic matelote, prepared by Ronan Cardorel, who works for Daniel Boulud. A matelote is a stew in which eel is cooked in a wine sauce with fingerling potatoes, button mushrooms and bacon lardons. Though red wine fish dishes are served all over France, matelotes are typical of the southwest, near the Bordeaux region.  Then, dining at Alain Ducasse at the Essex House one night, the menu included a matelote of Thai snapper in red wine.  Shortly thereafter, at Gordon Ramsay at the London, line-caught turbot in St.-\u00c9milion sauce was on the menu. That clinched it. How could I resist the notion of pairing our earthy, complex 2003 St.-\u00c9milions with fish in red wine sauce?  I was surprised to find turbot in a couple of markets, both Canadian wild (fillets) and French farm-raised (whole). Neil Ferguson, Gordon Ramsay's chef de cuisine, said sea bass fillets would be a fine stand-in.  In reproducing the Ramsay recipe, I simplified it somewhat, leaving out the salsify that garnished the fish.  Nevertheless, the dish requires the full attention of the cook the whole time, with nothing suitable for advance preparation.  Though you do not have to use a St.-\u00c9milion for the sauce, a Bordeaux-style wine, especially one with a generous component of merlot, is particularly appropriate. The same goes for your choice to pour at the table.  Turbot Poached in St.-\u00c9milion  Adapted from Gordon Ramsay at the London  Time: 1 hour  8 medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, about 1 pound  Salt  7 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche  8 tablespoons unsalted butter, preferably high-fat European style, diced  Freshly ground black pepper  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  16 pearl onions, peeled  1 large shallot, finely chopped  2 cups St.-\u00c9milion or other dry red wine, preferably merlot  2 cups fish stock  1 pound turbot or sea bass fillets, skinned, in four pieces  1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves.  1.  Place potatoes in boiling salted water and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, peel and mash in a ricer. Return to pan, heat briefly and add 5 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and 1 1/2 tablespoons butter. Season with salt and pepper and set aside in pan, covered.  2.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet, add onions and saut\u00e9 over medium heat until lightly browned and tender. Set aside, covered.  3.  Heat remaining oil in a wide saucepan or a saut\u00e9 pan that can hold fish in a single layer. Add shallots and saut\u00e9 over low heat 5 minutes. Add wine and stock and bring to a simmer. Slip fish pieces into pan. Poach 3 to 4 minutes, until just firm. Remove fish, draining well. Place on a warm plate and cover to keep warm.  4.  Boil cooking liquid until reduced to about 1 cup. Whisk in remaining cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and season to taste with salt and pepper. Over low heat add remaining butter bit by bit, whisking it in. Sauce will thicken somewhat and turn glossy.  5.  Reheat potato pur\u00e9e and spoon into center of each of 4 dinner plates. Place a piece of fish on top and place onions around. Gently reheat sauce and spoon over each portion. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.  Yield: 4 servings.  PAIRINGS",

''I make it at least twice a day,'' said Massimo Clemente, known as Max. ''We also prepare our own marinara sauce'' ($4.25 a quart, plain; $4.50 with meat).  There are homemade sausages hanging from stainless-steel hooks. Hand-hewn wooden bins are filled with fresh-dried pastas like cavatelli, spaghetti and fettuccine ($2.50 a pound).  Prepared foods include hearty Italian classics, mostly sold frozen: sausage, peppers and onions ($6 a pound); stuffed shells ($4); ravioli ($5); lasagna ($6); and manicotti with meat sauce ($6).  Customers arrive with coolers to fill with roasted peppers and marinated mushrooms ($6 a pound), imported sun-dried tomatoes ($8.99), olives ($5), and cheeses from Italy like Locatelli Romano ($8.99) and Parmigiano Reggiano ($14). Others stop for a wedge of Asiago cheese, which they grate over pasta or just eat with crackers ($8.99).  Although he has been the deli's sole owner for three years, Mr. Clemente was previously a partner for more than 30 years. ''We've been doing the same thing since Day One,'' he said.  Some add Gorgonzola ($8.99 a pound) and fresh mascarpone cheese ($8 a pound) to their pasta; others eat sliced provolone ($10.99) with fresh pears.  ''Our customers seem to buy the same thing week after week,'' said John Finamore, a member of the staff who has been serving the public for 20 years. Favorites include the imported meats: soppressata (imported dried Italian salami, $10 a pound), mortadella (Italian bologna, $6), capicola (cured salami, $10) and, of course, prosciutto ($14).  Sandwiches are a big attraction, like the one with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, capicola and roasted peppers, drizzled with balsamic vinegar on a roll ($5). Shelves are filled with spices, sauces and condiments. You can also pick up everything from a loaf of bread to a box of Perugina chocolates (28 pieces, $18.75).

            "fulltext": "WITH winter having unmistakably arrived, the sunny presence of lemons is more welcome than ever. Each year, demand for lemons peaks with the temperatures, as millions are squeezed for lemonade. But this is the time of year you need their brightness the most.  The harvest season's variety of diversions lets you feel free to juice lemons and dispose of the rest. But these cold days require more resourceful use of the fruit, especially with lemon prices rising and supplies reduced because of a recent freeze in California.  With plenty of sugar, and time to transform, whole lemon slices -- pulp, pith, peel and all -- become an intensely flavored tart. Candied, the peel gives another dimension to the pie's lemonade flavor. An almondy shortbread is an assertive pairing. (A little lemon juice added to the dough tenderizes it.)  Lemon zest -- the yellow part of the peel -- adds lemon flavor without the acidity of the pulp and juice. Sprinkle it on a meaty braise, on chunks of salty feta, or crisp fritters, sweet (ricotta) or savory (spinach). Candied strips also make a delightful afternoon nibble.  Pasta has an unlikely affinity for lemon, both zest and juice. Creamy, cheesy spaghetti al limone is succulent and lively. For a more streamlined dish -- no need for a recipe -- toss olive oil-splashed spaghetti with lemon juice and zest, then finish with Parmesan and a hit of the fermented anchovy sauce called garum, or some anchovies melted in hot oil. It's the umami flavor of a Caesar salad for a cold night.  Lemon is chicken's best friend -- stuffed whole inside a roasting bird with a sprig of rosemary, or wrapped in foil, baked soft and pur\u00e9ed for a sauce, \u00e0 la Jean-Georges Vongerichten, or tossed with fennel and egg yolk for a rich, tangy sauce.  Dozens of lemon varieties are grown around the world, varying in their sweetness, astringency and fragrance, the thickness of their skin, their juiciness. In the United States one variety, the Eureka, is probably the most widely grown.  But California's Meyer lemon, with its distinctive perfume and sweet, delicate flesh, has an almost cult-like following. A hybrid of lemon and sweet orange, it can be sliced, dressed with olive oil and sea salt and eaten on its own as a salad or side dish for chicken or fish. Add a handful of slices to vegetables or fish you are deep-frying: they emerge crisp lemony wafers.  If you can't find them here, you might mention to a friend on the West Coast that mailing a small package costs less than one might think.  With a bowlful of lemons on the table, who needs bottled juice? They last for several weeks, good for glazing a cake, zipping up a soup or dressing a salad.  And as you walk by, reach out, scratch the skin and inhale -- suddenly, regardless of the weather outside, you're in a lemon grove.  Spaghetti al Limone  Time: 45 minutes  1 lemon  11/2 cups dry white wine  3/4 to 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, to taste  1 pound spaghetti  3 tablespoons butter, in pieces  3 1/2 to 4 ounces Parmesan cheese, freshly grated  1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, to taste  Sea salt and fresh black pepper, to taste.  1. Zest lemon and slice zest into matchsticks. Juice lemon, strain and reserve. Place zest in large nonreactive pan with wine and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium high and cook until it reduces to a syrupy mixture, about 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes.  2. Remove from heat and pour in about 1/4 cup of cream. Stir, then pour in remaining cream. Return to stove and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until it is thickened and reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.  3. Meanwhile, bring large pot of generously salted water to boil. Cook pasta until al dente; reserve 1/2 cup cooking water and drain.  4. Return hot pasta pot to stove. Pour in cream, butter and lemon juice, stir, then add hot drained pasta and a few tablespoons of cooking water. Toss together and add cheese in three or four parts, tossing each to meld with sauce. Add more cooking water if sauce is too thick and crumbly.  5. Ladle onto plates and drizzle each portion with olive oil, then add a little salt and pepper.  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.  Lemon Confit Shortbread Tart  Time: At least 2 hours  For the crust:  3 cups flour  1 teaspoon salt  1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces  1 1/4 cups sugar  1 large egg  1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, or to taste  2 tablespoons lemon juice  For the confit:  8 lemons, preferably thin-skinned and seedless  3/4 cup sugar.  1. For crust, combine flour, salt, butter and 1 cup of sugar in a bowl. Mix with your fingers until it forms flaky crumbs and lumps. Mix in egg, almond extract and lemon juice. Continue to mix until it clumps; at first it may seem very dry. Shape into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 day ahead of baking.  2. For confit, slice off and discard ends of lemons. Slice 5 crosswise, peel and all, as thinly as possible. Remove any seeds and place in a bowl. Peel skin, including white pith, from remaining 3 lemons, then slice thinly crosswise, and add to bowl. Add 3/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Toss and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.  3. Place lemon slices and their juice in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook down until lemons are candied and small amount of liquid in pan is sticky and syrupy, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.  4. To bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide dough in half and form each half into a ball. Roll one ball until large enough to fit into a 9-inch round tart pan. Dough will be crumbly (more shortbread than pie crust); if it falls apart, press it back together. Spoon confit over crust, spreading evenly. Roll out second ball of dough and place on top, sealing edges but making sure no crust overlaps the rim (or tart will be difficult to remove later).  5. Bake until edges of tart are lightly golden, about 35 minutes, then sprinkle top with remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Return to oven for about 10 more minutes; edges should be lightly golden and crust cooked through but not browned. Serve warm or cooled.  Yield: 8 to 10 servings.  Chicken Breasts with Fennel and Lemon  Time: 45 minutes  1 lemon  1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts  Salt to taste  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1 medium large fennel bulb, sliced lengthwise and cut in strips  1 1/2 cups dry white wine such as pinot grigio  1 cup chicken broth  1 pinch cinnamon (about 1/8 teaspoon)  2 egg yolks.  1. Zest lemon and slice zest into matchsticks. Juice lemon, strain and reserve.  2. Lightly sprinkle chicken with salt. Put deep frying pan over medium-high heat, pour in oil and gently saut\u00e9 chicken breasts, about two minutes per side, until they are about half-cooked. Remove from pan.  3. Pour off oil and discard, then add fennel, wine and lemon zest to pan. Bring to boil over high heat and cook until wine is reduced by about half and fennel is tender. Add broth and cinnamon, bring to boil and cook about 5 minutes to reduce sauce a bit.  4. Add chicken with its juices and cook for 2 or 3 minutes.  5. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat egg yolks with half the juice (about 1 tablespoon), then ladle in about 1/4 cup of sauce. Mix well, then add to pan, mixing well. Cook over medium heat, stirring a bit, until sauce appears creamy. Taste and add more juice, if you like.  Yield: 4 servings.",

            "fulltext": "DARK brown, rich with a hint of sweetness. Altbier fits that description. So does onion soup. And the two can certainly be in harmony.  During the tasting Eric Asimov hinted that he would like a pretzel recipe for these ales, so I decided to make pretzel dumplings with cheese to serve in the soup instead of the usual toasted French bread covered with cheese.  It turned out to be a fine package. While tasting the ales, I thought their malty, toasted, spicy flavors, with bitterness that sometimes suggested buckwheat and burnt caramel, would go with other soups, like lentil, and with pungent washed-rind cheeses.  The onion soup I made followed a fairly classic recipe, though I deglazed the onions with some ale for another synergistic touch. There is ale in the dumplings, too. The recipe for those was based, to some degree, on my formula for matzo balls, which I make with sparkling water. Ale's fizz was a fine substitute. With this combination of ingredients, mustard was a natural seasoning.  The dumplings are best when cooked just before serving so that they can be fished, still hot, from their water bath and plopped into the soup without delay. But they can be drained, held, then reheated by steaming if that is more convenient. You can even steam them over the reheating soup.  The main trick to the soup is not to rush browning the onions. They take time to turn a uniform deep gold. I like what happens when the hot soup is set aside so that the thyme can infuse: there's a rounder touch of herbaceousness. Besides, soups like this are always better when reheated. A splash of lemon juice enlivens the flavor.  Onion Soup With Pretzel-Cheese Dumplings  Time: 11/2 hours, plus 1 hour's infusing  3 tablespoons unsalted butter  3 pounds onions, sliced thin  1 tablespoon sugar  12 ounces dark ale, preferably altbier  6 cups chicken or beef stock  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  Salt and black pepper  4 branches fresh thyme  2 cups packaged pretzel nuggets  1 1/2 cups grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese, more for serving  2 large eggs  1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard.  1. Melt butter in a 4-quart saucepan. Add onions and sugar and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until onions are golden, about 40 minutes. Add 1 cup ale and stir, scraping pot to release caramelized particles. Add stock. Simmer 30 minutes. Add lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Add thyme and set aside one hour or longer to infuse.  2. Pulse pretzels in a food processor or place in a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin to make coarse crumbs. Mix in a bowl with cheese. Lightly beat eggs, whisk in mustard and remaining ale and stir this mixture into pretzel crumbs and cheese. Form mixture into 18 dumplings about the size of Ping-Pong balls, place on a platter and cover until ready to cook.  3. About 20 minutes before serving, fill a 3-quart saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil. Drop dumplings into water and simmer gently 15 minutes. While dumplings simmer, remove thyme from soup. Reheat soup.  4. Ladle soup into bowls. Use a slotted spoon to transfer 3 to 4 dumplings to each bowl. Serve, with additional grated cheese on the side.  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.  PAIRINGS",

            "fulltext": "Coromandel in Orange is the third in the Coromandel family of Indian restaurants in this area. The first is in Darien, the second in New Rochelle, N.Y. (The same owners also have Dakshin, in Stamford, and Kolam, in Newtown).  Coromandel is further evidence of the trend I've been following now for a few years, as Indian restaurants start diverging from the inexpensive and predominantly north Indian cuisine most Americans have grown used to and introducing other regional styles served in a more upscale atmosphere.  Coromandel is a pretty, contemporary place with white tablecloths, a reasonably priced wine list and a comfortable ambience that is due in no small measure to the classy, generous service. The menu features dishes from around the subcontinent, specializing in south Indian cuisine, particularly from the southeastern Coromandel coast, for which the restaurant is named.  We ordered a number of south Indian appetizers, all successfully executed, starting with the unusual shaam savera, a chef's original made with paneer (a mild, white Indian cheese) sheathed in a spiced spinach mixture and presented in a pool of creamy, sweet-and-savory tomato sauce.  The traditional masala dosa -- a crisp, paper-thin rice crepe, so large it hangs off the plate -- enclosed a soft, mild-tasting mixture of potatoes and peas. It was accompanied by a rather bland coconut chutney and a fiery hot sambar. Sambar is a soupy lentil dish with chunks of tomato, carrot, and eggplant, seasoned with the ubiquitous south Indian trio of black mustard seeds, chiles and curry leaves; Coromandel's version was every bit as good as the sambar I looked forward to each morning while recently in India. (I also tried sambar vadai for the first time here one night: light, bready lentil dumplings floating in a bowl of sambar -- delicious.)  The rasam, a spicy south Indian soup, was thicker than I'm used to but nonetheless tasty; often served in a glass, here, it came in a bowl. Bagari jhinga, from the southwest coast, combined mustard seeds, red chili and curry leaves with shrimp and a sweet, creamy tomato sauce.  Among offerings from the north of India, we liked the ragata patties, a lively mixture of cumin-spiced potato, chickpeas, raw onion, tomato, cilantro and chutney; and tawa paneer, grilled slices of Indian cheese and vegetables, seasoned with a hearty masala of cumin, coriander, cardamom, turmeric and fenugreek leaves.  Of the entrees, several of our favorites were north Indian specialties, like the satrangi kebab, a straightforward rendering of tandoor-cooked meats and vegetables; the murgh shahi korma, a tender, moist, tandoor-cooked chicken breast served in a rich, creamy sauce; the familiar rogan josh lamb stew; and achari chops, sweet, spicy tandoor-cooked lamb chops.  From elsewhere in India, kozhi Chettinad (a chicken stew, hot with black pepper) was lovely, as was the Mangalorean prawn (shrimp in a sweet, spicy coconut sauce). Both were better than the galina xacutti (Goan chicken stew), in which the spices tasted raw, or the chicken biriyani, which tasted reheated, the spices strong, and the grains of rice no longer separate.  Breads here were some of the best I've tasted, including light, deep-fried poori (not often available) and crisp, feathery, layered paratha.  Desserts at Coromandel are predominantly traditional. The kheer (a saffron-flavored cream, lightly thickened with rice, studded with sultanas and cashews) was served in an off-kilter, blue martini glass. It was sweet and rich, as was the unusual south Indian version, parippu payasam, made like a kheer but with lentils and coconut milk.  Though the style of cooking is not my favorite -- many dishes are sugared and sauces are often oily -- Coromandel cooks this kind of Indian food very well. The dishes are appealing and tasty, characterized by big, hearty flavors, and most of my guests were wild about them. The stewed meats could be more tender, but it's a fantastic deal -- particularly the weekend all-you-can-eat brunch. And the service is wonderful.

This collection of items is an indulgence, not your usual sushi takeout.  Toro, uni, lobster, salmon, shiso leaves and fried lotus are a few of the ingredients that the chefs will artfully fashion into sushi and rolls. There are about 14 pieces in all, arranged in a black and silver box; prices start at $65, depending on the ingredients.  Orders must be placed at least one hour in advance, and will be delivered at no charge within a 10-block radius of the restaurant. They can also be picked up. Because the sushi is made fresh, to order, the rice will still be warm, so it's best to time your order so that it can be eaten without delay.  FOOD STUFF",

            "fulltext": "ASK New Yorkers to name a classic Greek dish, and many would say moussaka -- gooey layers of eggplant, ground meat and comfort. But a new breed of Greek restaurants here also serves dishes like rabbit phyllo, grilled branzino with artichoke confit and dandelion greens, and Cretan honey-braised lamb shank with yogurt pasta.  Trend-setting chefs like Michael Psilakis at Onera, Christos Valtzoglou at Pylos and Michael Symon at Parea, to name a few, are giving Greek food new vibrancy. Thirty-four Greek restaurants are listed in the latest Zagat guide, 18 of them newcomers since 2000.  So I wondered, as I headed to Greece recently, whether I would encounter inventiveness at restaurants there, too.  As soon as a deconstructed version of a tomato stuffed with rice was placed before me at 48 Restaurant in Athens, I knew I need not have worried. The rice had been typically seasoned with tomato, cinnamon, pine nuts and currants but was shaped like ovals of sushi. Slabs of slow-roasted tomato topped them. That the chef, Christoforos Peskias, has Ferran Adri\u00e0 as a mentor did not surprise me one bit.  As I traveled outside the big cities, I continued to be delighted by the fresh and new. In fact, as long as I stayed away from tourist places, I was in for an adventure.  But some of the most unusual yet simple and delicious food I found was in Rhodes, the large island not far from the coast of Turkey. This food was not obviously modern, but based on a sense of place and on the traditions and ingredients of the island. It's a rustic cuisine that New York restaurants have yet to discover.  I came home with recipes I could not wait to try. Most were from Mavrikos, a 70-year-old family restaurant in Lindos, a town in the southwestern corner of Rhodes known for its beaches and a steep acropolis reached by stairs or donkey. When Lindos was a jet-setting destination, before islands like Mykonos and Patmos were on the social radar screen, Mavrikos had a star-studded clientele. Nelson Rockefeller, members of Pink Floyd and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis stopped by, said Michalis Mavrikos, who runs the restaurant.  Most of the bold-face names have moved on, but Mr. Mavrikos and his brother, Dimitri, the chef, are maintaining the family's culinary traditions in the whitewashed dining room. Every evening, their father, Vassilis, 85, sits in one corner, near the small open kitchen, and casts a critical eye over everything.  For our party of six, Dimitri Mavrikos prepared a tasting menu of about 20 dishes.  (Tackling the recipes for some of them when I got home, I was happy to discover that even the most exotic-tasting dishes called for ingredients that are sold in American health food and Greek specialty stores, and also online.)  Gigantes, as huge, succulent butter beans are called, were simmered in a dark, musky sauce seasoned with carob. ''We can gather the carob pods from trees all around,'' Michalis Mavrikos said.  Fresh local red shrimp were peeled and pounded, raw, into a paste and seasoned with onion, garlic and orange, for a rich alternative to taramosalata. It's a dish I can try now, since fresh Maine shrimp are in season.  Freshly caught tuna loin was cured with sugar, salt and herbs, a little like gravlax, then sliced thin and served with pickled fennel. Gar, a long, skinny fish, was cooked and served in thick grape syrup, like saba, the Italian grape must. Poached skate was seasoned with herbs and pine nuts and formed into a timbale.  Meltingly tender beef had been slow-cooked in a casserole with cracked wheat and seasoned with bergamot, an aromatic citrus fruit that grows on the island and is best known as the flavoring for Earl Grey tea.  ''You are probably thinking that some of these dishes, especially with the cracked wheat and exotic spices, came from Turkey,'' Michalis Mavrikos said. ''I assure you they do not.''  The seasonings for the tuna included fenugreek, a slightly pungent, grassy herb with seeds that can have a celery flavor. Although American cooks may associate it with Indian cooking, it grows wild on Rhodes, as does cumin, another seasoning used in some of the dishes.  If there is any non-Greek influence in the food at Mavrikos, it is likely to be French or Italian. When the Turks controlled Rhodes, the Mavrikos brothers' paternal grandfather moved to Marseilles, where he owned a bistro. When Italy took over Rhodes in 1912 he returned, married an Italian woman and opened the restaurant in 1933. His son, Vassilis, studied cooking in Athens before returning to cook in the family restaurant.  Dimitri Mavrikos said the cooking of his father and grandparents, along with the local traditions, are his most compelling influences.  ''When I plan my menus I first try to find local things, vegetables from the villages, fish from nearby,'' he said. ''But local fresh fish are not as plentiful as they once were and it's getting harder to find them.''  The chef travels, often to London, when the restaurant is closed in winter.  ''I'm always a little sad when I'm abroad,'' he said. ''I often can't find real Greek food and rarely are there any Greek wines.''  Perhaps he should plan a trip to New York, where he'll find Greek wines and respectable and inventive Greek food as well.  Slow-Cooked Beef with Cracked Wheat  Adapted from Mavrikos Restaurant, Rhodes, Greece  Time: 3 1/2 hours  2 1/2 pounds shin of beef, with bone, in 2-inch chunks  2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil  1/2 cup finely chopped onion  1 clove garlic, minced  2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, finely chopped  1 teaspoon coriander seeds  2 bay leaves  4 whole allspice  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 cup dry white wine  3 tablespoons preserved bergamot (see note) 21/3 cups cracked wheat (not instant bulgur).  1.  Place beef in a pot with water to cover, bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes. Drain and dry meat.  2.  Heat oil in a heavy 4-quart casserole, add meat and lightly brown. Add onion, garlic, tomatoes, coriander seeds, bay leaves, allspice, salt and pepper and wine. Simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in bergamot and cracked wheat.  3.  Heat oven to 275 degrees. Transfer contents of casserole to a baking dish large enough to hold ingredients with room to spare. Pour 2 1/2 cups water on top. Bake, uncovered, about 1 1/2 hours. Take a spoon and push down into wheat to make sure it seems quite moist throughout. Add another  1/2 cup or so of water if it seems dry. Top layer of wheat will become crusty. Continue cooking about 1 1/2 hours longer, until wheat is very tender.  4.  Remove from oven. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Use a large spoon to fold ingredients together once or twice, adding salt and pepper if necessary, then serve.  Yield: 6 servings.  Note: Bergamot is sold in Greek shops and at www.titanfood.com as pergamont.  Tomato Sushi  Adapted from 48 Restaurant, Athens  Time: 3 1/2 hours  8 ripe plum tomatoes, about 2 1/4 pounds  3 cloves garlic  2 sprigs fresh thyme  1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, more for brushing  1 medium onion, finely chopped  1 bay leaf  3/4 cup sushi rice  1/2 cup dried currants  2 tablespoons white rum  1/4 cup rice vinegar  1 teaspoon sugar  1/4 teaspoon cinnamon  3 tablespoons julienned mint leaves  1/3 cup toasted pine nuts  Salt and freshly ground white pepper  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin.  1.  Heat oven to 250 degrees. Quarter six tomatoes. Scoop out pulp and seeds and reserve, leaving only flesh attached to skin. Place wedges skin-side down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Slice 2 garlic cloves and scatter on tomatoes, along with leaves from 1 sprig thyme. Place in oven and roast 2 hours. Meanwhile, discard seeds from reserved tomato pulp. Peel and seed remaining tomatoes. Finely chop all. Mince remaining garlic clove.  2.  Heat  1/4 cup olive oil in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Add onion and remaining garlic and saut\u00e9 over low heat until soft, about 20 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, remaining thyme and the bay leaf and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until all liquid has evaporated and mixture barely begins to brown, about 2 hours. Remove from heat and let cool. Remove bay leaf and thyme sprig.  3.  When tomato wedges have finished roasting, remove from oven, scrape off and discard skin and set wedges aside to cool.  4.  Mix sushi rice in a small saucepan with 1 1/4 cups water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook 15 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Place currants in a dish with rum.  5.  Transfer rice to a bowl and mix in vinegar, sugar and cinnamon. Press cooked tomato and onion mixture in a sieve to remove excess oil. Discard oil and fold tomato mixture into rice. Fold in mint, currants with rum and pine nuts. Season with salt and pepper. Let sit for 30 minutes.  6.  Form rice mixture into 24 ovals, using a scant tablespoon for each. Arrange on a platter. Place a piece of roasted tomato on each oval, like fish on sushi. Brush tomatoes with a little oil, sprinkle each with a few grains of cumin and serve.  Yield: 6 servings.  Timbale of Skate  Adapted from Mavrikos Restaurant, Rhodes, Greece  Time: 1 hour, plus 1 hour's chilling  2 skate wings with cartilage, 1 pound each, or 24 ounces lump crab meat  1 cup extra virgin olive oil, if using skate, plus 2 tablespoons for serving  1/3 cup white wine vinegar, if using skate  Juice and grated zest of  1/2 orange  Juice of 1 lemon  2 tablespoons pine nuts  1 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley  1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves  1 teaspoon capers  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 cup red wine vinegar  1/4 cup aged balsamic vinegar  1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar  1 small strip orange peel  3 black peppercorns  Lemon wedges for serving.  1.  Place skate in a saucepan with olive oil and white wine vinegar. Fish should be just about covered. Bring to a simmer and cook on low heat 30 minutes. Let cool in oil. Remove flesh from cartilage and place in a bowl. Fish will become somewhat shredded. If using crab meat instead, place in a bowl.  2.  Blend orange juice and zest, lemon juice, pine nuts, parsley, cilantro and capers in a blender until smooth. Fold into fish or crab meat. Season with salt and pepper. Pack some fish or crab meat into a 4-ounce mold (a  1/2-cup metal measuring cup works fine) and unmold onto a platter. Repeat with remaining fish or crab meat to make 6 timbales. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.  3.  Meanwhile, bring red wine vinegar, balsamic, brown sugar, orange peel and peppercorns to a boil in a small saucepan. Cook until reduced by half and syrupy. Let cool.  4.  To serve, transfer timbales to individual plates and drizzle a little olive oil on each. Spoon a little syrup on plate around each, garnish with lemon wedges. Serve.  Yield: 6 servings.",

            "fulltext": "PORK tenderloin, like its relative the beef tenderloin (sometimes called filet mignon), is among the leanest cuts of meat. Its versatility, ease of cooking and eating -- there are no bones and essentially no fat -- and relatively low price have made it popular.  But the lack of fat means a lack of flavor. It also means that if you cook the meat to well-done, as one typically does with pork, it tends to dry out.  There are a number of ways to cope with these challenges, including wrapping medallions in bacon and roasting the whole tenderloin in a flavorful coating. But a friend has come up with a new one.  In a Paris bistro he was served medallions that had been broiled and then sauced. They were good, he reported, but the unbrowned sides were unattractive.  ''I thought that if I cooked the entire cut and got it crisp on the outside, then cut the meat into steaks and browned them on their 'faces,' I'd get even better results,'' he said. ''And indeed mine were much better.''  To follow his lead: Brown the whole tenderloin (usually about the right amount for four people). Let it rest for a few minutes, so the meat firms up a bit. Then slice the tenderloin into medallions, about an inch thick. Brown the slices on both sides and build a sauce in the pan.  I've chosen a simple French-style cream reduction, but you can take the sauce in any direction you like. The relatively bland flavor of the meat will take to almost anything.  Twice-Cooked Pork Tenderloin  Time: 25 minutes  1 boneless pork tenderloin, about 1 pound  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  4 tablespoons butter, extra virgin olive oil, or a combination  1/4 cup cream  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, lemon juice or Calvados, optional  Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish, optional.  1.  Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper. Put a large skillet over medium-high heat; a minute later add 2 tablespoons butter and/or oil. When butter foam subsides or oil dimples, add meat (curve it into skillet if necessary). Brown it well on all sides, for a total of 4 to 6 minutes. Turn off heat, remove meat from pan, and let it sit on a board. When skillet has cooled a bit, proceed.  2.  Cut meat into inch-thick slices. Once again turn heat to medium-high, add remaining butter and/or oil and, when it's hot, add pork slices to pan. Brown on each side, about 2 or 3 minutes each. Turn heat to low and remove meat to a warm platter.  3.  Add  1/2 cup water to pan, turn heat to high, and cook, stirring and scraping, for a minute. Lower heat slightly, add cream and cook until slightly thickened. Stir in mustard, lemon juice or Calvados, if you're using them, then taste and adjust seasoning. Serve meat with sauce spooned on top, garnished, if you like, with parsley.  Yield: 4 servings.  THE MINIMALIST",

            "fulltext": "EMME of Capri, on Stamford's restaurant row (Summer Street), is so small you may pass it so quickly you'll have to backtrack.  Small doesn't mean insignificant, however. The mustard walls, with wood wainscoting and paintings of Italy, create the effect of an intimate cafe, warm and snug. The good-size menu features a number of interesting southern Italian choices, both for starters and entrees, and several intriguing desserts, a bit unusual for an Italian restaurant.  The crusty bread served with a pungent extra virgin olive oil was a good sign of pleasant dishes ahead.  I especially liked the Italian crepes as a starter. Stuffed with shiitake mushrooms, shrimp and artichoke hearts, they came in a gently seasoned brandy cream sauce with shallots. The portion was sensibly sized, so it didn't kill my appetite for an entree.  Other good choices were calamari all' agro, squid sauced in a piquant citrus sauce, and calamari and zucchini, the calamari crisply fried and mixed with fresh sliced zucchini. Funghi trifolati was also a winning selection -- three different mushrooms (shiitake, porcini and portobello) saut\u00e9ed in white truffle oil.  If you favor salad as a starter, there are seven to choose from. I was partial to the mista (fresh baby greens in olive oil and balsamic vinegar), both simple and zesty. Also appealing was the contadina -- crispy romaine lettuce with shaved parmigiano and crumbled Gorgonzola cheese in a sharp balsamic glaze.  Each menu comes with a printed attachment of the evening specials (a patron-friendly improvement on the verbal recitation at so many other places). One of my guests ordered cernia alla griglia -- fresh red grouper grilled, then sprinkled with extra virgin olive oil and lemon and served on a mound of broccoli rabe.  My own fish selection was less felicitous: salmone alla griglia. The waiter neglected to ask how I wanted the salmon prepared, and I forgot to specify lightly under-grilled. The end result was a filet tortuously overcooked. But the accompaniments were tasty: thin slices of zucchini saut\u00e9ed with garlic bits and well-roasted potato chunks.  Two pasta dishes were better entree selections. Orecchiette alla Pugliese consisted of tender pasta tossed with broccoli rabe and crumbles of sweet sausage; the bitter broccoli rabe was nicely balanced by the sausage. Farfalle ortolano was a textural contrast of bow-tie pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and shrimp, a pleasing combination of flavors. Another worthy dish was scaloppine Caprese -- lightly breaded, thin veal scallops topped with melted mozzarella, tomato slices, prosciutto and tomatoes.  Desserts are often an afterthought at Italian restaurants, but Emme surprised me with its options. Both the chocolate hazelnut cake (a rum-soaked sponge cake with hazelnut ganache) and lava di cioccolato (rich chocolate cake with soft interior served warm) were delicious. More predictable were the peach sorbet (served in a real frozen peach) and tartuffo al cioccolato (a chocolate covered ice cream ball).  There is a $20.99 lunch special, which includes salad, panini or pasta, and coffee or soda. Another good midday option is one of six panini on grilled rustic Italian bread. Hearty and excellent are the Marucella (grilled eggplant, zucchini and asparagus in extra virgin olive oil), Carosone (grilled chicken with fresh mozzarella and roasted red peppers in a picante balsamic glaze) and Annar\u00e8 (prosciutto di Parma, shaved parmigiano, tomatoes and arugula in a balsamic glaze).

The dish may be served alongside roasted or grilled meats. It is such a delectable tour de force, however, that at Michel Bras's restaurant in Laguiole, France, it is served as a separate course.  To make it yourself, finding the proper cheese and working the mixture to the desirable consistency are challenges.  Now, Marie de Livinhac, a company in the Auvergne region, is making a dehydrated aligot mix that requires only cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, water and five minutes' time.

A package to make enough for two is $7.99, one for four to five servings is $11.99, both at Fairway.  FOOD STUFF",

What ensues is a food fiesta.  Although this warehouse sale is small -- it's more of a boutique sale -- you will find everything to make a meal from start to finish. For instance, if you pick up some creamy fava beans, spicy chorizo and morcilla (blood) sausages and saffron, you will be on your way to making fabada asturiana, a rich Spanish stew. To make the perfect paella, buy some Bomba rice and a paella pan, which Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9 sells in several styles. The piquillo peppers from Navarra are good stuffed with goat cheese or with bonito tuna, both of which are sold here.  But the stars of this sale -- as with Spanish cuisine in general -- are the foods you can serve as tapas. Conrad Adillon, who owns the business, even serves tapas for customers to sample as they shop and socialize. He started the warehouse sales in 2001 because he wanted to introduce his friends and neighbors to the foods of his native Catalonia and all of Spain. The atmosphere is convivial, and Mr. Adillon is always eager to share recipes.  There is usually Serrano ham, lomo (dry-cured pork loin), stuffed olives, white asparagus, boquerones (anchovies) and an assortment of cheeses, including the popular Manchego cheese, which pairs nicely with membrillo, or quince paste. Prices for all of the foods vary according to brand, but are moderate and sometimes even cheaper than wholesale. Products are also sold on Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9's Web site.  Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9 Foods, 54 Schuyler Street, Belleville; (973) 759-0333 or www.oleolefoods.com. Open the second Saturday of the month from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The next warehouse sale is Jan. 13.

            "fulltext": "PET a Silkie chicken and you understand how it got its name. The feathers are fine and flutter in wisps in the breeze.  With a walnut-shaped crown of plumage, blue earlobes and feathers that come in a variety of colors, it's a striking-looking bird that's often raised for show.  Breeders also like them because they will hatch other birds' eggs.  ''They are such good moms,'' said Frank R. Reese Jr., the founder of Good Shepherd Turkey Ranch in Lindsborg, Kan., who breeds Silkies for show. ''They'll sit on anything and hatch anything. They'll hatch ducks, turkeys, chickens.''  Deprived of their striking outerwear, though, Silkies are far less appealing. They have bluish-gray skin, pitch-black bones and dark beige flesh (they're sometimes called black-skinned chickens). They're a scrawny pound or two, plucked, and are usually sold with the head and feet attached (with five toes, not the usual four).  Yet Asian cooks love them for their deep, gamy flavor, even in the breast meat. And with the nation's Asian population growing, sales have soared.  Murray McMurray Hatchery in Webster City, Iowa, sells about 10,000 Silkies a year, up from a few hundred 10 years ago, when the hatchery first started raising the little birds, said Bud Wood, an owner.  ''The majority are sold for ornamental purposes, but there's a big market in San Francisco, where there are Asians, and in Minneapolis, where there's a Hmong market,'' Mr. Wood said. Japanese, Cambodians and Koreans also eat the Silkie, he said.  At K. K. Live Poultry in Brooklyn's main Chinatown, Danny Wu, the owner, said he sells, butchers and cleans 3,000 Silkies a week, up from 400 a week 10 years ago. He attributes the growth to the number of Chinese moving from China and Taiwan to New York City.  ''They make it for soup, or for the broth for Mongolian hot pot,'' he said, ''and sometimes they make a curry.'' For chefs outside Chinatown, though, it is not the easiest dish to sell.  ''It's a scary-looking creature,'' said Patricia Yeo, of Sapa in Chelsea. She said she has her staff describe it as a deeply flavored, lean, free-range chicken.  She compares the Silkie to the blue-foot chicken, the domestic version of the poulet de Bresse of France; the blue-foot costs twice as much as the Silkie, she said. And unlike the blue-foot, the Silkie is rarely roasted.  In an Asian home, most often a Silkie will be made into a deeply flavored, aromatic, amber-colored soup, simmered or steamed with ginger, ginseng, dried wolfberries and dried red dates, also known as jujubes. The broth is usually served clear, but occasionally it has bits of meat in it. (A recipe can be found at nytimes.com/dining.)  In China, the Silkie is called wu gu ji -- black-boned chicken. It has been prized for its medicinal value since the seventh or eighth century, said Yu Ying-Shih, a retired professor of Chinese and East Asian studies at Princeton University. Women who have just given birth eat it for energy. But its curative powers are not necessarily gender-specific.  When Professor Yu was a small boy growing up in Anhui, in southeastern China, he said, because he had constant headaches, he was given bowls of Silkie chicken soup to make the headache go away.  Did the soup work?  ''I don't know,'' he said, ''but probably it helped.''  That same soup can be ordered a day in advance at some restaurants in Manhattan's Chinatown, like Oriental Garden and Danny Ng's.  Cooked in the traditional way, with ginseng, the soup has a hint of bitterness. Without ginseng, it is simply an addictive, intensely flavored broth.  Yvonne L. C. Wong, an art consultant and trustee of the China Institute, makes her variation of the soup with Virginia ham, wolfberries, dried white yam, preserved orange peel and ginger. It may be to the Chinese what chicken soup is to Jews -- liquid penicillin.  Ms. Yeo slow-cooks the chickens in curries and other braises. When she was growing up in Cambridge, England, she remembers, her grandmother visited from Kuala Lumpur and made the family the traditional Chinese soup in a clay pot.  For her black-skinned chicken slow-cooked in dark soy sauce at Sapa, Ms. Yeo braises the quartered chicken in a dark, aromatic sauce that includes onions, garlic, ginger, galangal, chilies, wolfberries, Chinese dried red dates, soy sauce and star anise.  ''My secret ingredient?'' she said, as she ran upstairs from the restaurant pantry to the kitchen. ''Coke!'' She said she substitutes it for the traditional rock sugar, because she likes Coke's caramel flavor. She braises the chicken the night before she puts it on the menu, as a special, because it, like nearly all braised dishes, tastes better the next day.  At the Jefferson Restaurant in Greenwich Village, Simpson Wong takes an even more European turn. He cooks the Silkie leg and thigh as a confit in olive oil, seasoned with garlic and rosemary, for six hours, and does a quick saut\u00e9 of the tender breast meat in a savory sauce of garlic, ginger, rice wine lees, oyster sauce and lemon balm.  At Chow Bar in Greenwich Village, Peter Klein serves slow-cooked black chicken in red Thai coconut sauce. He also slow-cooks it, shreds the meat and mixes it with an Asian barbecue sauce. Then he stuffs it into toasted Chinese bread, along with paper-thin slices of cucumber and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro leaves.  Mr. Klein asks his staff to describe the chicken as particularly fresh and lean.  ''We try not to go into great detail,'' he said. ''The American public is a little squeamish.''  Black-Skinned Chicken Slow-Cooked in Dark Soy Sauce  Adapted from Patricia Yeo  Time: 1 1/2 hours  2 tablespoons canola oil  1 large Spanish onion, diced  5 cloves garlic, smashed  1/4 cup Chinese bean paste  2 2- to 2 1/2-pound chickens, head and feet discarded, cleaned and rinsed  1 inch-thick piece of unpeeled ginger, cut into 4 pieces  1 inch-thick piece unpeeled fresh or frozen galangal, smashed  2 Thai bird chilies  1/2 cup wolfberries or 1/4 cup finely diced dried apricots  1/4 cup diced jujubes (also known as hong zao or red dates) or 1/8 cup of dried brown dates, diced  3 cups dark soy sauce  1 cup cola  1 star anise pod  2 cardamom pods  2 cinnamon sticks  1 clove.  1. Place a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat, and add oil. When oil is hot, add onion, garlic and bean paste, and saut\u00e9 until onion is tender.  2. Add chickens, ginger, galangal, chilies, wolfberries, jujubes, soy sauce and cola. Stir, and add star anise, cardamom, cinnamon, clove and just enough water to cover chickens. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, for 45 minutes. Remove chickens, cut into serving pieces, and serve with broth ladled over chicken and steamed rice.  3. If you want a thicker sauce, remove chickens. Cook broth over high heat until it becomes syrupy and glossy, about 20 minutes. If too salty, add a little water. Cut chicken into serving portions, add to sauce, heat through and serve.  Yield: 4 servings.  Note: Bean paste, chickens, galangal, chilies, wolfberries, jujubes and dark soy sauce can be bought in Chinese food stores.  Black-Skinned Chicken Slow-Cooked in Coconut Sauce  Adapted from Peter Klein  Time: About 1 hour 40 minutes  1 1 1/2 -pound black-skinned chicken, head and feet discarded, cleaned, rinsed and quartered  4 cups light chicken stock  1 cup Chinese rice wine  1 inch-long piece of ginger, peeled and sliced  1 small onion, peeled and quartered  2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed  1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 teaspoon vegetable oil  1 teaspoon minced ginger  1 teaspoon minced garlic  1 tablespoon Thai red curry paste  1 tablespoon tomato paste  1 13.5-ounce can coconut milk  1 zucchini, trimmed, peeled, and cut into long julienne  1 tablespoon fresh lime juice  1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves.  1. In a small heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine chicken, stock, wine, ginger, onion, garlic, five-spice powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, covered, until chicken is very tender, 1 to 11/2 hours. Remove chicken and set aside. Strain and reserve 1/2 cup of cooking liquid.  2. Place a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, and add oil. When hot, add ginger and garlic and saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in curry paste, tomato paste and coconut milk. Add chicken, reserved cooking liquid and a pinch of salt.  3. Cover and bring to a gentle simmer. Add zucchini and simmer just until cooked, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in lime juice and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with chopped basil, and serve.  Yield: 2 servings.  Note: Chicken and rice wine can be bought in Chinese food stores.

            "fulltext": "FIRST there were the tree lights at New York City's famous Tavern on the Green. The single big elm and several London plane trees there have been wrapped with 10 miles of white mini-lights for decades.  The glow through the woods of Central Park is pretty wonderful -- sort of a ghost-tree vision in the darkest months of the year. Christmas carols have faded from the air but the tree lights remain until the days get considerably longer than the nights and we have green leaves again.  Walking west in the dark from the Tavern on the Green tree spectacle a couple of weeks ago, I came upon a block just off the park where almost all the street trees had cords of small white lights wrapped around their skinny trunks and around the branches up to the tips. This phenomenon is not limited to here in Manhattan; these tiny white lights outline trees in front of restaurants and stores throughout the suburbs on main streets and in shopping malls.  I'm absolutely in favor of tree lights strung in plain old Christmas-tree fashion. And even more in favor of lights along fences and around windows. God knows we're starved for light this time of year. But tree-wrapping, winding the cords round and round each trunk and branch, seems to have become a pandemic. It's beginning to look like bondage, especially when the tree in question is a young thing trying to stay alive in a sidewalk tree pit. Street trees are already being urinated on by dogs and wounded by cars and starved by poor soil, to mention only a few of their miseries.  I thought at first that the heat and light through the winter might hurt the tree, but it turns out the problem is more mechanical than physiological. Touch the little bulbs and you'll see they're not very hot. The extra light could have some effect, but most of the trees have lights put on them when they're already deeply dormant. The problem for the tree starts when people lay hands on them. They're at risk when people are putting the lights up and at more risk when people are taking them down. The greatest risk is when the lights aren't taken off at all.  Professional decorators put the lights on with care. It takes six weeks and a cherry picker to put the lights on the trees at Tavern on the Green. The same head gardener, a person with a stake in the trees' continuing good health, is in charge of putting the lights up and taking them down. In spring the cords are sheared and the lights are thrown away. (The area's two most distinguished exemplars of good horticulture practices, by the way, do not indulge in this kind of tree-wrapping. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden doesn't wrap any of its living trees. At the New York Botanical Garden, a lighting engineer puts lights on three small cherry trees in containers by the visitors' center with watchful horticulture staff standing by.)  As for taking the cords off, it's almost impossible to unwind them gently come spring. If you've ever undressed a Christmas tree you know how tempting it is to give a yank. On a cut tree that's not a big deal; on a live tree it could pull off branch tips or whole branches. While professional decorators working on other trees have probably put the lights on attentively (with their invoices still to be presented), they note that they're not removed with the same care.  The worst damage to the tree occurs when the strings of lights are simply left on to shine again next winter. As the trunk and branches grow thicker, the circling cords dig into the bark and impede the movement of food and water up and down the tree. Girdling trees (not with light cords, but by taking off a thin strip of bark all the way around the trunk) is what early American farmers did when they wanted to kill off trees and clear a field. Nowadays you can see cords cutting into the trunks of banyan trees in Honolulu and palm trees in Miami Beach, which are wrapped with lights year-round.  My husband refuses to see what I've come to term ''tree-throttling'' as an outrage, and of course there are more terrible crimes against nature. The lights are pretty, he says, and they highlight the shape of the tree. Yes, but plain old Christmas-tree-style lights strung along -- but not around -- the branches are also pretty and without the garrote effect. A river birch or maple or palm or banyan is beautifully highlighted with a spotlight shining on it from the ground below.  Glowing trees fill a need. What bothers me is that in trying to cheer ourselves in winter we're not fully taking in the fact that these trees are alive, that given care they will be useful and beautiful in other seasons -- and that they're more than our accessories.

            "fulltext": "IT'S right there, invisible, inside your oven, the most underappreciated, taken-for-granted appliance in your kitchen: the broiler.  Bread machines, microwaves, sandwich-makers, electric grills and other ''must-haves'' come and go, but the broiler is always there. Hundreds of books are written about grilling, roasting, frying, even microwaving and steaming, for crying out loud, yet the broiler is largely ignored.  The broiler is free -- that is to say, you already own one -- and easy to use. It is essentially an upside-down grill, but it produces results you cannot duplicate any other way. It even has a couple of distinct advantages over the outdoor grill and the countertop version.  As a boy, I watched my mother broil almost every night in our oversize ''rotisserie,'' which took up half the counter space in our modest Manhattan apartment. (I fear that she, too, was a victim of gadget marketing; our oven broiler remained unused.)  As a young food writer, freed from the constraints of the city, I wrote about the joys of wintertime grilling. As a middle-aged food writer, I'm writing about the benefits of wintertime broiling: you don't have to brave the weather, and you get a warmer kitchen. All you need to do is turn a dial (or, these days, frustratingly, push a couple of buttons, one of them several times). And -- a real bonus that you do not get with grilling, either indoor or outdoor -- the juices of whatever you're broiling stay in the pan.  You've probably seen cookbook directions that start ''on the grill or under the broiler,'' as if they were the same thing. Broiling, though, requires some different techniques, and it's taken me some time and a little rewriting of the rules to optimize my skills.  First of all, forget about broiler pans and aluminum foil. As everyone knows, the pan is nearly impossible to clean (which explains the aluminum foil), and it's designed to allow the valuable juices -- mostly fat, but, hey, fat is flavor -- drip through the grate and into the bottom. What good are the juices doing you there? The problem with most of today's meat is not too much fat but too little, so there's no need to get rid of it.  Another problem with broiler pans is that they trap air under the food, keeping the underside cool, which makes turning necessary, increases cooking time, and reduces browning. By using a skillet instead, you eliminate all these problems.  Most modern broilers are now unfortunately equipped with thermostats, so they cycle on and off, never really getting hot enough. Start by heating your oven to its maximum temperature, typically 550 degrees; then turn on the broiler.  While the oven is preheating, leave a skillet or a grill pan (a ridged skillet) inside. The best pans for this are cast-iron, enameled cast-iron, or heavy-duty steel -- not stainless steel, but what chefs call ''black steel.'' Almost needless to say, this pan must be all metal and not flimsy. Keep potholders handy.  In most cases, that skillet will stay as close to the heating element as possible, about two or three inches away. That's roughly the distance you want if you have an old-fashioned under-oven broiler, even though it will allow you to put the food closer, almost in contact with the flames. Adjustments may also be needed with a really powerful broiler, of the kind more often found in restaurants, where two or three inches may be way too close. After a little experimenting, you'll find the ideal distance for your broiler. (My broiler, on which all of my calculations are based, is 17,000 B.T.U., and is typical. Some broilers, including most electric ones, are closer to 10,000 B.T.U.)  Finally, do what it takes to keep the broiling element on. Most broiling happens so fast -- often in less than 10 minutes -- that if the element cycles off, it will throw off your timing. It's not disastrous, but it's a nuisance. I have taken to shoving the skillet as far back on the oven rack as I can, and leaving the oven door open a crack.  Now you're ready. What can you cook? Almost anything, although some foods are more cooperative than others: meat of all kinds, especially steaks and chops; fish, from steaks like tuna or swordfish to fillets both thick and thin; shellfish; chicken (usually best without skin, which, as every experienced griller knows, readily catches fire); and even vegetables, especially tomatoes, peppers and chilies.  The technique varies little from one ingredient to the next. For one-inch steaks (rib-eye or sirloin are best), have the meat at room temperature and dry it well. Broil in a preheated skillet about eight minutes for medium rare; turning is unnecessary. You may want to serve it bottom-side up, especially if you use a grill pan.  For one-inch fish steaks or thick fillets, brush the fish lightly with olive oil first. Cooking time for medium to medium well will be less than 10 minutes.  Boneless, skinless chicken breasts will take five or six minutes, less if they're thin. Thighs need about 10 minutes; you may have to move the oven rack down a notch if they brown too quickly.  Turn scallops or shrimp in extra virgin olive oil and salt before broiling for about three minutes. Simply toss clams or mussels into the preheated skillet. They're done when they open, within 10 minutes. If shells start to crack, remove the open mollusks and return the pan to the oven.  Thin fish fillets, like flounder, are a little different. Preheat the pan for about five minutes, remove it, and pour in about three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, then put the fillets in the oil. Time under the broiler will be 90 seconds to 2 minutes, rarely more.  There. If I'd told you I had an appliance that could brown like a grill, was as convenient as your oven, and cooked most food in less than 10 minutes, you'd buy it. But you don't need to.  Hard-Shell Clams with Parsley Pesto  Time: 20 minutes  2 cups parsley leaves (thin stems are O.K.), washed  Salt  1/2 clove garlic, more to taste  1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, or more  1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or lemon juice  2 dozen hardshell clams (littlenecks or cherrystones), washed and scrubbed.  1. Turn on broiler and put a large cast-iron skillet under it while you make parsley pesto. Combine parsley with a pinch of salt, garlic and about half the oil in a food processor or blender. Process, stopping to scrape down sides of container if necessary, and adding rest of oil gradually. Add vinegar or lemon juice, then a little water to thin mixture slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning.  2. Carefully remove skillet from broiler, add clams to it and return to broiler. They should all open more or less at once, within 10 minutes; remove them as soon as they do to preserve their juices, and put on a plate. Dab each with parsley sauce and serve hot. (Any clams that do not open are safe to eat; open them with a dull knife, or continue to broil a few minutes longer.)  Yield: 4 or more servings.  Tortilla Soup  Time: 1 hour  2 fresh chilies, preferably pasilla  1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, each cut in half  2 tablespoons neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn  3 cloves garlic, sliced  1 large onion, sliced  Salt and freshly ground pepper  Pinch dried oregano  4 cups any stock or water  1 to 2 cups tortilla chips  1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped, optional  1 ripe avocado, peeled and sliced, optional  1 or 2 radishes, thinly sliced, optional  1 lime, juiced, plus one cut into wedges.  1. Heat broiler. Arrange chilies and tomatoes in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and place a few inches away from broiling element. Cook until charred on one side, then flip them with tongs and char other side, about 5 to 8 minutes total. When cool, skin, stem and seed chilies, then chop them.  2. Put oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; a minute later add garlic and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and softened, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and chilies, crushing tomatoes with back of a wooden spoon. Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of oregano; add stock or water and adjust heat so mixture simmers gently. Cook for 20 to 30 minutes, crushing tomatoes from time to time. (You can prepare soup up to this point in advance. Let it sit for a few hours, or cover and refrigerate for up to a day before reheating and finishing.)  3. Stir in tortilla chips and simmer another three to five minutes. Season to taste with lime juice, salt and pepper, then garnish if desired and serve with lime wedges.  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.  Broiled Steak with Pineapple and Onion Salsa  Time: 30 minutes  1 pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into thick rings (canned rings are O.K.; drain excess syrup)  1 large onion, cut into thick slices  3 tablespoons olive oil  1 tablespoon minced fresh chile, like jalape\u00f1o or Thai, or to taste, or dried red chile flakes or cayenne to taste  2 tablespoons chopped basil or mint leaves  2 tablespoons lime juice  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 12- to 16-ounce sirloin strip or ribeye steaks, preferably at room temperature.  1. Start broiler; set rack about 4 inches from heat source. Brush pineapple and onion slices with olive oil and put on a baking sheet. Broil, turning once or twice, until soft and slightly charred, about 8 minutes total. Remove slices as they finish cooking and chop into bite-size chunks, saving as much juice as possible. When finished, set a cast-iron pan under broiler and let sit for about 10 minutes.  2. In a bowl, combine pineapple and onions with chile, basil and lime juice. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir to combine. Let sit for about 5 minutes, then taste and add more chile, lime or salt to taste.  3. Season steaks with salt and pepper. When pan is very hot, carefully remove from oven and add steaks; return to oven immediately. Broil steaks 6 to 10 minutes for rare to medium rare. (Timing will depend on thickness of meat and broiler heat; check by feel or by making a small slit in one steak and peeking in.) Serve steaks hot, with salsa.  Yield: 4 servings.  THE MINIMALIST",

            "fulltext": "THERE was a time when pasta dishes dressed with just cheese, cream or milk were popular, at least with me and my family, but today they seem stodgy and fat. Although these popular standbys almost always feature a strong hit of black pepper, they don't contain acidity or real spice, and seem one-dimensional despite the strong flavors. They're also almost always white, beige and yellow, not exactly a stunning color combination for what for us was often a weeknight main course.  It doesn't take much to fix that. Here's a variation on a classic dish, pasta with Gorgonzola, that adds color, acidity and strong flavor without increasing the cooking time a single second. And it increases the shopping and prep times by only about five minutes.  There are added benefits. You use two nonwinter vegetables that are decent in midwinter: arugula and cherry or grape tomatoes. The arugula adds spice, crunch and color (watercress will work equally well). The tomatoes, which are ubiquitous in markets these days, have real flavor, unlike regular tomatoes in midwinter. They also add some much-needed acidity.  You can put this together in the time it takes to boil pasta, and it's quite straightforward. The thicker the liquid you use, the thicker and richer your sauce. You could start with skim milk -- or water, for that matter -- and have a thin but still flavorful sauce. I usually settle on whole milk but, truth be told, a bit of cream is very nice here.  Buy a creamy piece of cheese that will ultimately melt into the pasta, and a variety with strong flavor: blue d'Auvergne, Maytag blue, good Roquefort or mature Stilton are all good substitutes for Gorgonzola. Because you turn the sauce into the pasta over heat, slightly undercook the pasta at first.  Farfalle is my pasta shape of choice here, but it hardly matters. What does matter is putting a nice-looking, complex-tasting pasta dish on the table in less than a half-hour.  Farfalle with Gorgonzola, Arugula and Cherry Tomatoes  Time: 30 minutes  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 cup half-and-half, cream or milk  1 cup crumbled Gorgonzola or other good blue cheese  1 pound farfalle or other pasta  2 cups arugula trimmed of very thick stems, washed, dried and chopped  1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, cut in half  Freshly grated Parmesan to taste, optional.  1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. In a small saucepan gently warm the half-and-half and Gorgonzola just until cheese melts a bit and mixture becomes thick; chunky is O.K.  2. When water boils, cook pasta until it is just tender but not mushy. Drain and return to pot over low heat.  3. Stir in Gorgonzola sauce along with arugula, tomatoes and a healthy dose of black pepper. Stir to combine, taste and add salt, if necessary, then serve immediately, with grated Parmesan if you like.  Yield: 3 to 6 servings.  THE MINIMALIST",

            "fulltext": "LIKE a giant extension cord, an electric transmission cable named for Neptune and stretching 50 miles underwater from Sayreville, N.J., is about to be plugged into Long Island, bringing the equivalent of a large power plant to a power-hungry region.  Within days, divers and crews working 1,500 feet off Jones Beach State Park will begin to feed the end of the cable into two conduits going underwater and underground to an excavation pit at the pitch-and-putt golf course at Jones Beach.  Once the cable's three strands are threaded through the conduits and spliced to a part of the cable that is already in the ground along Wantagh State Parkway, Long Island's electric grid will be connected to New Jersey and the extensive PJM regional grid. PJM, one of a handful of regional transmission operators in the country, serves New Jersey and all or parts of 12 other states and the District of Columbia. It is supplied by coal, hydroelectric and nuclear generators, none of which exist on Long Island.  The cable is scheduled to begin operating by July, in time for peak electricity demand.  The connection will realize a longtime goal of the Long Island Power Authority to expand its capacity to import electricity to Nassau and Suffolk, preferably for a lower cost than power generated on Long Island.  The Neptune cable is about 10 inches in diameter, not much stouter than a small tree trunk, and protected from corrosive saltwater by a black polyethene sheath. It will carry 660 megawatts of electricity -- larger than any other import source for the Island.  LIPA imports power from New England on the 330-megawatt Cross Sound Cable, which runs underwater from Connecticut. Two older cables, the 600-megawatt Y49 cable and the 599-megawatt Y50 cable, also run under the Sound to the Island.  The Neptune cable is part of LIPA's push to add to the amount of available electricity. The authority is backing construction of the 350-megawatt Caithness Energy generating plant in North Bellport and a 140-megawatt, 40-turbine wind complex off the South Shore.  The Neptune Regional Transmission System of Fairfield, Conn., which owns the cable, began construction on the $600 million project in fall 2005. A specially rigged ship reeled spools of cable to the ocean floor, where a water-pressure device called a hydroplow dug a trench four to six feet under the seabed. The trench filled in as sediment resettled, the company said.  Christopher Hocker, the company's vice president for planning, said the route was surveyed for obstructions before any cable was laid. ''The contractor wanted to avoid ugly surprises,'' he said. The company said it avoided fishing grounds along the route.  The Cross Sound Cable drew opposition from politicians, shellfishing groups and environmentalists in Connecticut who said it posed a threat to clams and oysters at the bottom of the Sound. But the Neptune cable, which runs 65 miles including the underground sections, generated little opposition.  Bert J. Cunningham, LIPA's vice president of communications, said the authority was looking for a power supply agreement with a single supplier on the PJM grid. ''We are anticipating we will get lower-cost power from the PJM power market than we would be able to generate on Long Island,'' he said. He said the Neptune cable would increase the supply of electricity available to LIPA to 6,830 megawatts. Demand hit a record 5,792 megawatts last Aug. 3.  The cable's underground portion runs along the east side of Wantagh State Parkway, where excavation closed a 4.5-mile bicycle path used by more than 100,000 people a year. George Gorman, the Long Island regional director for the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said the path would reopen by Memorial Day weekend.  ENERGY",

Within days, divers and crews working 1,500 feet off Jones Beach State Park will begin to feed the end of the cable into two conduits going underwater and underground to an excavation pit at the pitch-and-putt golf course at Jones Beach.  Once the cable's three strands are threaded through the conduits and spliced to a part of the cable that is already in the ground along Wantagh State Parkway, Long Island's electric grid will be connected to New Jersey and the extensive PJM regional grid. PJM, one of a handful of regional transmission operators in the country, serves New Jersey and all or parts of 12 other states and the District of Columbia. It is supplied by coal, hydroelectric and nuclear generators, none of which exist on Long Island.  The cable is scheduled to begin operating by July, in time for peak electricity demand.  The connection will realize a longtime goal of the Long Island Power Authority to expand its capacity to import electricity to Nassau and Suffolk, preferably for a lower cost than power generated on Long Island.  The Neptune cable is about 10 inches in diameter, not much stouter than a small tree trunk, and protected from corrosive saltwater by a black polyethene sheath. It will carry 660 megawatts of electricity -- larger than any other import source for the Island.  LIPA imports power from New England on the 330-megawatt Cross Sound Cable, which runs underwater from Connecticut. Two older cables, the 600-megawatt Y49 cable and the 599-megawatt Y50 cable, also run under the Sound to the Island.  The Neptune cable is part of LIPA's push to add to the amount of available electricity. The authority is backing construction of the 350-megawatt Caithness Energy generating plant in North Bellport and a 140-megawatt, 40-turbine wind complex off the South Shore.  The Neptune Regional Transmission System of Fairfield, Conn., which owns the cable, began construction on the $600 million project in fall 2005. A specially rigged ship reeled spools of cable to the ocean floor, where a water-pressure device called a hydroplow dug a trench four to six feet under the seabed. The trench filled in as sediment resettled, the company said.  Christopher Hocker, the company's vice president for planning, said the route was surveyed for obstructions before any cable was laid. ''The contractor wanted to avoid ugly surprises,'' he said. The company said it avoided fishing grounds along the route.  The Cross Sound Cable drew opposition from politicians, shellfishing groups and environmentalists in Connecticut who said it posed a threat to clams and oysters at the bottom of the Sound. But the Neptune cable, which runs 65 miles including the underground sections, generated little opposition.  Bert J. Cunningham, LIPA's vice president of communications, said the authority was looking for a power supply agreement with a single supplier on the PJM grid. ''We are anticipating we will get lower-cost power from the PJM power market than we would be able to generate on Long Island,'' he said. He said the Neptune cable would increase the supply of electricity available to LIPA to 6,830 megawatts. Demand hit a record 5,792 megawatts last Aug. 3.  The cable's underground portion runs along the east side of Wantagh State Parkway, where excavation closed a 4.5-mile bicycle path used by more than 100,000 people a year. George Gorman, the Long Island regional director for the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said the path would reopen by Memorial Day weekend.  ENERGY",

DETAILS In the Green Mountains of north-central Vermont, this project is the first slopeside development in Stowe, the center of a resort area long popular with weekenders -- especially in winter. It is at the foot of Spruce Peak, which is connected by a new lift to 4,393-foot Mount Mansfield, the state's tallest mountain. On 35 acres, it includes 20 one-third-acre home sites, 38 four-bedroom units in 19 cabins and a lodge building with 108 full-ownership condominiums and 34 residence club units. The lodge building will be the heart of the development, and its full-ownership condos -- studios and three-bedroom units -- will form a hotel through an optional rental program. The residence club units, two- to four-bedrooms, will be sold in one-eighth shares, with owners granted at least four weeks a year in their units. All the residences in the central lodge building will be sold furnished and will have balconies and gas fireplaces. The golf course will be 18 holes and is planned to be completed this spring. The full-service spa and fitness center is scheduled to open in the fall. Also, there are plans for performance and retail spaces to be added over the next few years.

            "fulltext": "WORK on replacing the Roslyn Viaduct is expected to continue unabated now that the contractor and the Village of Roslyn Harbor are near agreement on how to transport large concrete beams to the construction site.  The replacement of the three-quarter-mile-long viaduct, which was built in 1948 and carries Route 25A, known locally as Northern Boulevard, has long been planned. But Gerson Strassberg, the village mayor, said that village officials were not told until November that 412 large concrete sections of the bridge would be transported along Roslyn Harbor streets from midnight to 5 a.m.  The plan called for the beams, some weighing 60 tons, to be taken to Roslyn Harbor from Virginia by barge and then placed on a flatbed truck and driven 1.3 miles to the viaduct along Glenwood Road and Bryant Avenue.  Mr. Strassberg said that village officials were also not told that because of the height of the beams -- some of them 17 feet high -- utility wires along the truck route had to be raised to 22 feet off the ground and tree limbs had to be cut.  After four meetings with the contractor, the Tully Construction Company, of Flushing, Queens, and the State Department of Transportation, Mr. Strassberg said it was agreed to minimize inconvenience to the village by using other roads to transport the smaller beams to the viaduct.  The viaduct is a main section of Route 25A, carrying 38,000 vehicles a day, but it has no shoulders, the sightlines are poor, and heavy trucks are prohibited.  Gerard Terry of Jericho, the lawyer for Tully Construction, said plans agreed to on Dec. 20 called for only about 60 percent of the beams to be transported through the village. He said the route for the other beams had yet to be determined.  Plans call for four beams to be moved each night using two flatbed trucks making two trips each. Typically, Mr. Terry said, the shipments will be made on a weeknight.  ''So we will be making about 120 trips through the village over the course of one year, and each trip takes approximately 10 minutes,'' Mr. Terry said.  The company and the village were still completing their agreement, with hopes of beginning the truck runs sometime this month.  The $120 million project is scheduled for completion in 2008.

            "fulltext": "FOR years, the noise, vibration and fumes from Long Island Rail Road trains idling on a track siding in the Village of Patchogue have been a nuisance to residents. But after the installation of an automated signal system last May, the idling trains are now virtually in some residents' backyards.  Jack Eddington, a Suffolk County legislator whose district includes Patchogue, said a six-foot chain-link fence is all that separates the trains from the backyards of homeowners on Academy Street.  ''The trains are literally 10 feet from their homes,'' he said.  Ann M. Goodhue, who lives on the opposite side of Academy Street, said she found the ''train situation atrocious.'' She said vibrations from three trains that sat idling on the siding several years ago cracked her second-floor ceiling.  Mr. Eddington said he had been at the siding when two trains were idling and found the noise very loud. ''And they give off a diesel smell,'' he said.  Until several years ago, the siding was about a mile west in a commercial area. Mr. Eddington said complaints from residents were fewer because a lumberyard and a bowling alley were on either side of the tracks and homes were far from the idling trains. But about six years ago, he said, trains were instructed to idle about three-quarters of a mile to the east, ''and it became a general nuisance because it was almost right in the middle of town.''  When a new signal system was installed last May about 200 to 300 feet farther east to align with a switch for the tracks, train engineers were instructed to idle there, said Susan McGowan, a railroad spokeswoman.  Mr. Eddington said that change put the trains ''right along the backyards of 12 or 13 homes'' on Academy Street.  ''I want the railroad to do the right thing'' for the residents, he said. ''I have looked up and down the track, and I see areas that don't have homes. I'm not telling them where they should go, but what I am saying is that where they are now is not acceptable.''  Ms. McGowan said that in an effort to ''minimize the inconvenience,'' the railroad had relocated two of six weekday trains that use the siding. One was moved 10 to 20 feet to the north siding, and a second was moved to a siding in Speonk.  ''These are the first steps we have taken,'' she said. ''We're continuing to look at the situation.''

Crowds of shoppers, rivaling those at the races, could be coming, too.  But not if residents, school personnel and municipal leaders in the neighboring Villages of Floral Park and Bellerose have their way.  The open-air market, which would operate in the racetrack's northernmost parking lot on Tuesdays, Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. from March to December, has been operating for the last nine years at Aqueduct Raceway in Queens. The New York Racing Association closed the market to make more room for parking and offered its operator a lease at Belmont Park.  ''We don't object to the market itself, only the location, which would abut one of our elementary schools,'' said Lynn Pombonyo, the superintendent of the Floral Park-Bellerose school district. ''All there is between the school grounds and the proposed market is a chain-link fence. That looks far too risky to us.''  Jenell Horan, the school PTA's co-president and parent of four children ranging in age from 7 to 12, agreed. ''It's a very bad setup for the safety of our kids,'' she said. ''Predators and pedophiles are a reality in our society, and they could have access to our kids through the fence.''  Another parent at the school and a trustee of Bellerose Village, Rosaleen Shea, said: ''How do we know there won't be pornography and drug paraphernalia at the market? Or that our children wouldn't be lured away by offers of iPods or candy?''  Nonsense, said Carol DeSanto, who has managed the Aqueduct flea market for nine years and was astonished at the idea that it could be perceived as a threat.  ''Our vendors are good, honest, working people, and we don't attract a rowdy crowd,'' she said. ''Not everyone can afford to shop at Nordstrom or Bloomingdale's, you know. There's a place for an off-price market in today's economy, a very important place.''  Ms. DeSanto has applied for a special permit from the Town of Hempstead, which includes Bellerose and Floral Park, to locate the market at Belmont Park. Even though Floral Park is adjacent to the track, it has no jurisdiction over it, as Belmont Park sits outside the village in an unincorporated part of the town. Joseph Pellegrini, the secretary for the Town Board of Zoning Appeals, said a decision on the permit would be made by the end of January.  Felice Rubin, who has lived in Floral Park for 25 years and reared two children there, said she would object to any activity that brought a number of people into the neighborhood, regardless of the reason. ''It wouldn't help the quality of life in the village,'' she said, ''and it would certainly raise concerns about our safety.''  To help soothe concerned residents, Ms. DeSanto said she would be willing to reduce the number of vendors to 400 at Belmont Park from the 600 she had at Aqueduct.  Even with the reduction in vendors, said David Fowler, president of the Floral Park-Bellerose school board, noise from the 2,000 to 3,000 people he estimated would attend the market would disturb children in the classroom and at play outdoors.  Ms. DeSanto said the market would draw 8,000 to 10,000 shoppers on a busy day and 1,500 at a time. Belmont Park averaged 4,629 racing patrons a day last fall.  The Floral Park mayor, Phil Guarnieri, said that the ball fields were used seven days a week for soccer, baseball and lacrosse. ''The market could bring in as many as 1,400 cars,'' he said. ''That's not good for the school or the children.''  But Frank Formato, who lives in Elmont, which borders Belmont Park to the south, said he would welcome the market at a parking lot near him. ''I'd be happy to shop there,'' he said. ''Everybody likes a bargain.''  RELOCATION",

Even though Floral Park is adjacent to the track, it has no jurisdiction over it, as Belmont Park sits outside the village in an unincorporated part of the town. Joseph Pellegrini, the secretary for the Town Board of Zoning Appeals, said a decision on the permit would be made by the end of January.  Felice Rubin, who has lived in Floral Park for 25 years and reared two children there, said she would object to any activity that brought a number of people into the neighborhood, regardless of the reason. ''It wouldn't help the quality of life in the village,'' she said, ''and it would certainly raise concerns about our safety.''  To help soothe concerned residents, Ms. DeSanto said she would be willing to reduce the number of vendors to 400 at Belmont Park from the 600 she had at Aqueduct.  Even with the reduction in vendors, said David Fowler, president of the Floral Park-Bellerose school board, noise from the 2,000 to 3,000 people he estimated would attend the market would disturb children in the classroom and at play outdoors.  Ms. DeSanto said the market would draw 8,000 to 10,000 shoppers on a busy day and 1,500 at a time. Belmont Park averaged 4,629 racing patrons a day last fall.  The Floral Park mayor, Phil Guarnieri, said that the ball fields were used seven days a week for soccer, baseball and lacrosse. ''The market could bring in as many as 1,400 cars,'' he said. ''That's not good for the school or the children.''  But Frank Formato, who lives in Elmont, which borders Belmont Park to the south, said he would welcome the market at a parking lot near him.

It is built like, and looks like, a fortress; it can -- and did -- sleep 300; and it contains an apartment fit for a commodore. Its large common area has hardwood floors but is perfect for parking tanks, storing ammunition and conducting military drills. For a starting bid of $800,000, the old armory here is available.  Built in 1894, the New Jersey National Guard Armory, former home to the state's Second Regiment, was abandoned by the military more than 40 years ago. It is now for sale by the City of Paterson, which is looking for a buyer who will preserve the historic building, with its intricate masonry and rich history.  ''It's tough, because what can you really do with an armory?'' Mayor Jos\u00e9 Torres said.  The city's deadline for bids ended Jan. 11, and the mayor says a commission is assessing the four offers that were submitted. He said he had originally hoped the Paterson School District would buy the property and turn it into a much-needed recreation area.  But the district, plagued with financial concerns and bound by oversight from the state, said it could not take on the building.  So Mr. Torres, intent on keeping the building intact rather than being demolished and sold for scrap (''People like to build mansions with these old bricks,'' he said) is hopeful that one of the bids will suit everyone's needs. The city did not identify the bidders, but Mr. Torres said one was interested in using the armory for sporting events and other activities and another wanted it as a site for a business.  A recent tour of the building showed that it is in need of significant repair. There is a thin layer of feathers and pigeon waste in the great hall, from birds that roost on the giant steel beams and the sills of boarded windows. There is a potential asbestos problem and no sprinkler system. The electrical system is shot, and the floors on the second level crack and buckle underfoot.  ''It's a real challenge,'' Mr. Torres said. ''We need someone with deep pockets.''  The city took over the property several years ago after the armory's owner, a private citizen who used it to store military memorabilia, had failed to pay property taxes for several years.  Mr. Torres said the sale of the armory, along with nine other vacant lots or abandoned buildings throughout the city, would add about $8 million to the city coffers. He said he hoped to have a decision on the building's fate by the end of this month.  There once were more than 100 National Guard facilities around the state, but only 34 remain. While some of the decommissioned armories have been demolished, others have become space for movie sets and storage, turned into community centers, or, like the former armory in East Orange, converted into mosques.  Joe Bilby, assistant curator of the National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey in Sea Girt, said the Paterson armory was among the oldest in the state, with most having been built between 1890 and 1920.  ''Before that, the buildings weren't made to last and often the ammunition was stored in city halls,'' he said. ''These buildings can last.''  Soldiers based at the Paterson Armory saw combat during the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II, Mr. Bilby said. He said a unit descended from the old Second Infantry had been there as late as 1956.  Mayor Torres, a lifelong Paterson resident, said he remembered attending the circus, concerts and boxing matches at the armory in his youth. He said he hoped that the building -- with its castlelike entrance, wide staircases, steel arches and expert masonry -- could regain some of its former glory and help the city with redevelopment.  ''It's a place that offered a real sense of community and has substantial value,'' the mayor said. ''It'd be nice to have that again.''  PRESERVATION",

Crowds of shoppers, rivaling those at the races, could be coming, too.  But not if residents, school personnel and municipal leaders in the neighboring Villages of Floral Park and Bellerose have their way.  The open-air market, which would operate in the racetrack's northernmost parking lot on Tuesdays, Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. from March to December, has been operating for the last nine years at Aqueduct Raceway in Queens. The New York Racing Association closed the market to make more room for parking and offered its operator a lease at Belmont Park.  ''We don't object to the market itself, only the location, which would abut one of our elementary schools,'' said Lynn Pombonyo, the superintendent of the Floral Park-Bellerose school district. ''All there is between the school grounds and the proposed market is a chain-link fence. That looks far too risky to us.''  Jenell Horan, the school PTA's co-president and parent of four children ranging in age from 7 to 12, agreed. ''It's a very bad setup for the safety of our kids,'' she said. ''Predators and pedophiles are a reality in our society, and they could have access to our kids through the fence.''  Another parent at the school and a trustee of Bellerose Village, Rosaleen Shea, said: ''How do we know there won't be pornography and drug paraphernalia at the market? Or that our children wouldn't be lured away by offers of iPods or candy?''  Nonsense, said Carol DeSanto, who has managed the Aqueduct flea market for nine years and was astonished at the idea that it could be perceived as a threat.

But the district, plagued with financial concerns and bound by oversight from the state, said it could not take on the building.  So Mr. Torres, intent on keeping the building intact rather than being demolished and sold for scrap (''People like to build mansions with these old bricks,'' he said) is hopeful that one of the bids will suit everyone's needs. The city did not identify the bidders, but Mr. Torres said one was interested in using the armory for sporting events and other activities and another wanted it as a site for a business.  A recent tour of the building showed that it is in need of significant repair. There is a thin layer of feathers and pigeon waste in the great hall, from birds that roost on the giant steel beams and the sills of boarded windows. There is a potential asbestos problem and no sprinkler system. The electrical system is shot, and the floors on the second level crack and buckle underfoot.  ''It's a real challenge,'' Mr. Torres said. ''We need someone with deep pockets.''  The city took over the property several years ago after the armory's owner, a private citizen who used it to store military memorabilia, had failed to pay property taxes for several years.  Mr. Torres said the sale of the armory, along with nine other vacant lots or abandoned buildings throughout the city, would add about $8 million to the city coffers. He said he hoped to have a decision on the building's fate by the end of this month.  There once were more than 100 National Guard facilities around the state, but only 34 remain. While some of the decommissioned armories have been demolished, others have become space for movie sets and storage, turned into community centers, or, like the former armory in East Orange, converted into mosques.  Joe Bilby, assistant curator of the National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey in Sea Girt, said the Paterson armory was among the oldest in the state, with most having been built between 1890 and 1920.  ''Before that, the buildings weren't made to last and often the ammunition was stored in city halls,'' he said. ''These buildings can last.''  Soldiers based at the Paterson Armory saw combat during the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II, Mr. Bilby said. He said a unit descended from the old Second Infantry had been there as late as 1956.  Mayor Torres, a lifelong Paterson resident, said he remembered attending the circus, concerts and boxing matches at the armory in his youth. He said he hoped that the building -- with its castlelike entrance, wide staircases, steel arches and expert masonry -- could regain some of its former glory and help the city with redevelopment.  ''It's a place that offered a real sense of community and has substantial value,'' the mayor said. ''It'd be nice to have that again.''  PRESERVATION",

            "fulltext": "SOME see the long-closed Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge as a 6,767-foot-long rusting relic. Others envision a gleaming pedestrian walkway, offering spectacular views of the Hudson Valley.  It is that vision that inspires members of Walkway Over the Hudson, a nonprofit group dedicated to building the walkway and reopening the bridge so that strollers and cyclists can experience firsthand what has captivated railroad enthusiasts and history buffs, not to mention politicians and writers, for decades.  Fixing up the bridge -- the first to span the Hudson south of Albany -- is something of an obsession for David Rocco, a retired carpenter from Yorktown and a member of Walkway. Mr. Rocco said the bridge combines three of his favorite things: train tracks that can be converted to public pathways, railroad history and ''the beautiful Hudson River.''  ''It's the trifecta for me,'' he said.  Walkway, which has owned the bridge since 1998, would love to reopen it in the spring of 2009 to coincide with the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's first trip up the river. The challenges are considerable; most glaring is the more than $10 million -- some estimates run as high as $30 million -- needed to build a walkway from the charred remains of a fire that closed the bridge in 1974, as well as pay for other additions, like an elevator.  The bridge, which is parallel to the Mid-Hudson Bridge, was completed in 1888, five years after the Brooklyn Bridge opened. It initially served passengers and freight and was the primary rail route for goods traveling from New England to points west of the Hudson. After the completion of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City in 1917, its role diminished. It was being used strictly for freight when the 1974 fire torched the railroad ties on the Poughkeepsie side, warping the rails. The bridge never carried another train.  Fred Schaeffer, a Poughkeepsie lawyer who is Walkway's president, said the bridge -- an Erector Set-like structure that climbs out of the Hudson like a black skeleton -- deserves better. ''The bridge helped this country grow,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. ''It tied this country together.''  Now, Mr. Schaeffer simply hopes the bridge will tie the Hudson Valley together. Walkway members see it as the centerpiece connecting bike paths and green space, with shops and restaurants dotting the surrounding areas.  Whether it is all a pipe dream should become clearer in coming months, when an engineering firm hired by Walkway completes a feasibility study. In November, as part of the study, inspectors in wetsuits found the bridge's underwater piers to be sound, but the structure is in dire need of a paint job, and building a walkway some 212 feet above the Hudson will not be done by weekend volunteers.  The group also hopes to build an elevator to the walkway in Poughkeepsie's Waryas Park, near the city's Metro-North station, a children's museum and a cluster of restaurants.  An $874,000 grant from the federal government in 2005 was a big step, as was $155,000 from the governor's office. The City of Poughkeepsie also ripped up a $550,000 tax lien that Walkway had inherited from the bridge's previous owner. Mayor Nancy Cozean said she saw the project as a metaphor for older cities looking to reinvent themselves.  Still, Mr. Rocco concedes that the group is far from its financial goal. He hopes to make up the difference with a mix of city, county and state funds, along with private donations. The local congressman, Maurice Hinchey, said he was doing everything he could to make sure the project was financed. ''I'm absolutely certain this is going to go,'' he said.  Something about the bridge and the views of the Hudson it provides seem to inspire optimism. ''Standing atop that deserted railbed was among the most humbling experiences I've ever had,'' said Robert Klara, a writer and railroad historian who walked over the bridge in the early '90s. ''Views notwithstanding, there's a kind of industrial lyricism to the bridge's trusses, rivets and crossbars. Even as a ruin, it's a thing of great beauty.''  Local residents say anything meant to spur tourism has their support. Enjoying an unseasonably warm January day in Waryas Park, in the shadow of the bridge, William Durling said he was intrigued by the project.  ''It'd be excellent for the city to rejuvenate the bridge,'' he said.  LANDMARKS",

The attack by an AC-130 gunship, which is operated by the Special Forces Command, is believed to have produced multiple casualties, the official said. It was not known Monday night whether the casualties included members of a Qaeda cell that American officials have long suspected was hiding in Somalia.  Special Forces units operating from an American base in Djibouti are conducting a hunt for Qaeda operatives who have been forced to flee Mogadishu, the Somali capital, since Islamic militants were driven from there by an Ethiopian military offensive last month.  The American attack was first reported by CBS News.  The Special Forces attack is the first military action in Somalia that Pentagon officials have acknowledged since American troops departed the lawless country in the wake of the infamous ''Black Hawk Down'' episode in 1993, when 18 American soldiers were killed in street fighting in Mogadishu.  American officials have long suspected that a handful of Qaeda suspects responsible for the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania have been hiding inside Somalia, a country that has not had a central government since 1991.  The search for the terrorist suspects has driven American policy toward Somalia for several years.  Earlier this year, the Central Intelligence Agency began making cash payments to a group of Somali warlords who pledged to help hunt down members of the Qaeda cell.  After Islamist militias took control of Mogadishu in the summer, officials in Washington charged that the Islamists had ties to the terror suspects, and made demands for their handover to American custody.  The Ethiopian military offensive that began last month recently drove the Islamists from the seaside Somali capital, raising hopes within Washington that the Qaeda operatives might surface as they fled the protection of the Islamists. The Islamists have retreated to areas around the southern port city of Kismayo. Ethiopian officials have said they have intelligence reports that members of the Qaeda cell were hiding near the city.  The AC-130 gunship is a heavily armed propeller plane that, because of its slow speed, operates primarily at night and can direct an immense barrage of gunfire onto a target as it circles overhead.  The attack against suspected Qaeda operatives is the sort of targeted operation that senior Bush administration officials have been pressing the Special Operation Command, based in Tampa, Fla., to undertake in recent years.  But officials have said that Special Operations forces have had difficulty carrying out targeted strikes in the past because of the difficulty establishing the whereabouts of wanted terrorists or getting forces in place when a suspected militant is located.  The Central Intelligence Agency has killed a small number of suspected Qaeda members, using a pilotless drone armed with a missile. Among them were five people killed in Yemen in 2002.",

NATO said up to 150 insurgents might have been killed in the fighting.  Two large groups of insurgents were spotted gathering on the Pakistan side of the border and were tracked as they crossed into Afghanistan, NATO said in a statement released in Kabul.  Afghan Army soldiers and NATO troops laid an ambush for the groups about half a mile inside Afghanistan, using air and ground forces, said Gen. Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.  The insurgents were in trucks loaded with men and weapons and crossed the border about 2 a.m., General Azimi said. Afghan and NATO forces set up an ambush in a deserted area near the border, he said. He reported no Afghan or NATO casualties, but estimated that about 80 insurgents were killed. The clash occurred in the Barmal district of Paktika Province, which borders the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, one of the most lawless areas of the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Militants from both countries, along with hundreds of foreign fighters, operate Taliban training camps there and mount frequent attacks across the border into Afghanistan.  The Pakistani military guards the border but has failed to stem cross-border attacks; NATO officials say there has been a marked increase in infiltration at the border since September compared with last year.  ''Pakistani military liaison officers were kept fully informed throughout the operation,'' NATO said in its statement.",

            "fulltext": "Kenyan officials announced Wednesday that they were closing their northern border because of the conflict in Somalia, but denied that they had turned back hundreds of refugees.  For the past few days, Ethiopian-led forces have been hunting down the remnants of Somalia's once powerful Islamist movement, pushing fighters steadily south toward the Kenyan border. Ethiopian officials have said the Islamist fighters are headed to a remote jungle outpost called Ras Kamboni, which terrorism suspects have used before as a hide-out.  It now seems that Somalia's problems have sucked in yet another country, and with the final throes of the conflict on their doorstep, Kenyan officials said they had no choice but to act.  ''We needed to close the border so we could closely vet all refugees,'' said Alfred N. Mutua, a spokesman for the Kenyan government.  But Mr. Mutua denied news reports and accusations from United Nations officials that Kenyan border guards had deported 600 Somalis seeking asylum, saying that the closing applied only to cross-border trade and nonrefugee traffic, to prevent the Islamists from slipping into the country.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday that Kenya ''has a humanitarian obligation to allow civilians at risk to seek asylum on its territory.''  Mr. Mutua said that 10 foreign Islamist fighters were caught Monday trying to cross the border in a throng of refugees. The fighters were carrying briefcases packed with cash. Kenyan officials said they probably had been financiers of Somalia's Islamist movement, which was routed last week by Ethiopian soldiers supporting Somalia's transitional government.  As hundreds of Somalis continue to line up at the border each day, hoping for asylum, Kenya has buttressed its patrols with extra troops and helicopters. Residents on the Kenyan side of the border have reported skirmishes in Kenya, but Mr. Mutua said that was not the case.  ''We're just trying to make sure none of the problems from Somalia spill across the border, and so far none has,'' he said.  In Mogadishu, Somalia's battle-scarred capital, several weapons were collected Wednesday in the transitional government's drive to disarm one of the most heavily armed citizenries in the world. On Monday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, the transitional prime minister, issued one of his first edicts, demanding that Somali warlords and gunmen turn in their military-grade weapons by Thursday. If they did not, he said, homes would be searched.  Elders from one of Mogadishu's more powerful subclans turned over a pickup truck equipped with an antiaircraft gun and 20 young fighters. Transitional government officials said the weapons and men would be folded into Somalia's new national army.  Meanwhile, Islamist leaders continued to insist that they had not been defeated.  ''I cannot say where we are, but we are in Somalia and we are not afraid anymore,'' Abdulrahim Ali Modei, the Islamists' spokesman, said Wednesday in a telephone call to a Somali radio station.",

            "fulltext": "The second in command of Somalia's defeated Islamist forces has surrendered to the Kenyan authorities and is staying at a hotel in Nairobi, Western diplomats and Somali officials said Monday.  Sheik Sharif Ahmed, the head of the Islamic Courts Union executive council, was part of a group of Islamist leaders being hunted down by American and Ethiopian troops in southern Somalia. Described as a moderate Muslim and potential peacemaker, he surfaced at the Kenya-Somalia border in the past week, Somali officials said, and now the Kenyan immigration authorities are deliberating about what to do with him.  ''Sheik Sharif is in Nairobi,'' said Abdirahman Dinari, spokesman for Somalia's transitional government. ''We are waiting for the next move.''  Several Western diplomats said American officials, who have urged Somalia's newly empowered government to reconcile with moderate Islamist leaders, were instrumental in arranging Mr. Ahmed's safe passage to Kenya.  ''He decided to come to Kenya only after getting a guarantee from the Americans that he would not be deported'' back to Somalia, said a Western diplomat in Nairobi who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He's been here a week.''  Over the weekend, the BBC broadcast an interview with Michael E. Ranneberger, the American ambassador to Kenya, in which Mr. Ranneberger said, ''We certainly have made clear to the T.F.G.,'' Somalia's transitional federal government, ''that it needs to talk to all elements, and that includes people such as, for example, Sheik Sharif.''  At that point, Mr. Ahmed, a school-teacher turned religious leader, was still widely believed to be hiding in the marshes of southern Somalia or possibly dead.  On Monday, an American Embassy official denied that the United States played any role in bringing him to Kenya. ''We're not holding or interrogating or protecting him,'' she said on condition of anonymity. ''We're not involved in this operation in any way.''  Kenyan officials did not return calls for comment.  European diplomats in Kenya said American officials were playing an increasingly large behind-the-scenes role in Somalia, pursuing an aggressive counterterrorism agenda but also trying to shape Somalia's political future.  Several Somali leaders seemed to welcome that involvement, saying that Italy, the other Western power in Somalia, had discredited itself by trying to establish a rapport with the Islamists before they were defeated.  Last month, the Islamists attacked Somalia's transitional government, which was based in Baidoa. What they did not expect was a crushing response from Somalia's neighbor Ethiopia, which sided with the transitional government because Ethiopian officials viewed the Islamists as a regional threat.  It took all of one week for the Ethiopian-led forces, with approval from American officials, to rout the Islamist army and install the transitional government in Mogadishu, Somalia's bullet-pocked capital by the sea.  Mogadishu is now loosely controlled by a mix of Ethiopian troops and government soldiers, who are struggling to pacify a population that is armed to the teeth. On Monday, residents said a gun battle between Ethiopian troops and masked men in a crowded livestock market killed seven people, four of them insurgents and three civilians.  Western diplomats said Mr. Ahmed, 42, could be enormously helpful in defusing the violence because he has a devoted following among former Islamist fighters, who are suspected of being the backbone of Somalia's growing insurgency.  United Nations officials said Mr. Ahmed could be granted political asylum in Kenya or another country in the region, possibly Yemen, so that he can meet with Somalia's new leaders on neutral soil and map out a path forward.  Abdirizak Adam Hassan, chief of staff for the transitional president, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, said that if the Islamic leader renounced violence, he would be welcome back in Somalia. ''We're not after his blood,'' he said.  The case is a little different, though, for Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys, the Islamists' top leader. Mr. Aweys is nowhere to be found, and most Somalis believe that he will never turn himself in because American and Ethiopian officials have accused him of being a terrorist.",

Also, the Israeli Air Force bombed a tunnel near the eastern edge of the Gaza Strip, saying that Palestinian militants were digging it to enter Israel and carry out an attack. The tunnel was near the Karni crossing, which is used to move goods between Israel and Gaza.  The two main Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, held late night talks on Monday and agreed on a truce that took effect at 3 a.m. Tuesday. While Gaza was mostly calm during the day, several previous cease-fires have broken down and there were doubts about this one as well.  In one incident, a local Hamas leader was shot dead in the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis. The shooting appeared to be a revenge attack by a family aligned with Fatah, which recently had a relative killed in the fighting, according to Palestinian residents of the town.  More than 30 Palestinians have been killed in gun battles since Thursday, and about 60 have died over the past two months.  Egypt, which has often mediated between the Palestinian factions in recent years, helped broker the latest truce.  While Gazans welcomed the reopening of shops and the semblance of normalcy that prevailed on the streets on Tuesday, many said the truce would remain vulnerable unless Hamas and Fatah could agree to work together in the government.  A good deal of the fighting has involved members of the Palestinian security forces. Many members are loyal to Fatah, which long dominated Palestinian politics, but Hamas created a security service, known as the Executive Force, after it came to power a year ago.  Months of negotiations have failed to produce a deal between Hamas, the radical Islamic group that controls much of the government, and Fatah, led by the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas.  Mr. Abbas, speaking in Cairo after a meeting with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, said Hamas's Executive Force was ''illegitimate and illegal.''  Mr. Abbas also condemned a suicide bombing on Monday by a Palestinian in the southern Israeli resort town of Eilat, which killed three workers at a bakery.  The Palestinian leader said the bombing was ''not in the interest of the Palestinian people.'' Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, which is linked to Fatah, had claimed responsibility for the bombing with Islamic Jihad.  Israel has given no indication that it plans a major military response to the suicide bombing, the first such attack in Israel in nine months.  ''The initiative will be ours, and we have no intention of relaying what we plan to do,'' Amir Peretz, the defense minister, said during a visit to Eilat.  However, Israeli newspapers, citing political and military officials, said no large-scale operations were planned.  In a separate development, Israel's deputy prime minister, Shimon Peres, met in Qatar with the emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. That was the highest-level meeting in years between officials of the countries.  The emir urged Israel to hold talks with the Palestinian government, according to the Web site of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which had a reporter traveling with Mr. Peres. Israel, which classifies Hamas as a terrorist group, refuses to deal with the organization, and Hamas does not recognize Israel.  Israel and Qatar do not have diplomatic relations, though there is an Israeli trade mission in the Qatari capital, Doha. Mr. Peres visited Qatar when he was prime minister in 1996.",

The fighting took place in the neighborhood around Haifa Street, a mostly Sunni Arab enclave with a small Shiite population.  A spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Muhammad al-Askari, said that an Iraqi Army unit had gone into the area after receiving reports that Sunni fighters had set up a fake security checkpoint and were taking Shiites aside and shooting them.  The bodies of many of those killed at the roadblock were then hanged from the lampposts, Mr. Askari said.  He said that Iraqi soldiers had moved in and surrounded the fighters at the checkpoint. In initial fighting there, 30 of the men were killed and several more were arrested, Mr. Askari said, adding that the neighborhood remained locked down. There was no way to verify the figures.  Residents living nearby said that they were hearing continued fighting through the night but that it was impossible to know precisely what was happening.  In the same neighborhood, there were reports of clashes as government forces moved to collect 27 bodies dumped behind a local hospital. But it was unclear whether the firefight with Iraqi troops was related.  The government said Saturday that 72 bodies were recovered around the city on Saturday, most showing signs of torture.  Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki announced Saturday the beginning of a new Baghdad security operation and promised to purge the government security forces of militia fighters and others with sectarian aims.

            "fulltext": "A front-page article in Egypt's semiofficial state newspaper on Sunday accused Iranian intelligence of involvement in the 2005 killing of Egypt's ambassador to Iraq.  The report, which was denied by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry and the Iranian Foreign Ministry, comes at a time of heightened concern in Egypt and other Arab states about Iran's growing influence in the region. Egyptian officials have said they are upset and worried that Iraq is moving away from the Arab world and coming under the influence of Iran, a Shiite and non-Arab state.  The article, which appeared in Egypt's most widely circulated newspaper, Al Ahram, was attributed to anonymous sources and stated that Iran's goal was to ''cut off the legs'' of Egypt from Iraq.  It said the belief that Iran was involved in the killing helped explain Egypt's support for President Bush's plan to send additional troops into Iraq. It offered no evidence to support those claims.  In 2005, in an effort by Egypt to support Iraq's newly elected, Shiite-dominated government, Ihab Al Sharif was sent to Iraq in June as the first resident ambassador from a Sunni Arab state. One month later, Mr. Sharif was abducted, and he was killed four days later.  The Egyptian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday denying the newspaper report. ''We have no relationship to what was published, and we don't have any information to this effect,'' Alaa El Hadidy, spokesman for the ministry, added in a telephone interview. ''This is an old story buried and closed.''  An unidentified person at the Iranian Foreign Ministry told the Islamic Republic News Agency, Iran's official news agency, that the article was ''baseless and completely false.''  Still, the report on Sunday could strain already tense relations between the countries. While Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia took responsibility for the killing of Mr. Sharif in 2005, his killers were never caught. The killing was seen by Arab states as an attempt by Sunni insurgents to discourage their governments from fostering ties with the mainly Shiite Iraqi government.  But the article contributed to concerns about Iran's seeming quest for influence in Iraq. Speaking on the news channel Al Jazeera on Sunday, Mustafa El-Fiqi, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Egyptian Parliament, said, ''Now we are starting to hear this new tale that could be influenced by the tense nature of Iranian-Arab relations at this stage because of the sectarian war in Iraq, and perhaps in Lebanon and other areas.''

Discussions are set to resume Feb. 8 though the United States and North Korea have not settled a dispute over freezing North Korean assets at a bank in Macau, a Chinese territory.  United States Treasury officials and their North Korean counterparts met Tuesday in Beijing to discuss American measures that have led to the freezing of $24 million in North Korean assets held at the bank, Banco Delta Asia. No breakthrough appeared imminent, but the talks were set to continue Wednesday.  The dispute overshadowed the last round of nuclear negotiations, which ended in a stalemate in December. Whether North Korea would bargain on its nuclear program while its money remained frozen was unclear.  The United States contends that the matter is separate from the nuclear issue and that the deposits are linked to North Korean counterfeiting and money laundering.  North Korea exploded a nuclear device in October, adding a sense of urgency to six-nation talks that have dragged on for more than three years without tangible progress.  Many American and Chinese analysts say they doubt North Korea will give up its nuclear arms voluntarily after spending decades working to buy and develop the technology.  But the analysts also say that the Bush administration and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, may have more to gain by continuing the talks than abandoning them, at least partly because China, the key intermediary, insists that the talks are the only way to proceed.  The United States and China agreed to impose limited United Nations military sanctions on North Korea after its nuclear test. But China has opposed tougher penalties on North Korea, its former ally.  Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state and the chief American envoy at the talks, says the North Koreans have signaled their commitment to a 2005 accord on dismantling their arms program. He met his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, in Berlin this month, and both sides said they had set the stage for a productive round.",

The bomber was trying to enter the base, NATO said, but detonated the vest when he reached the search point.

However, the Israeli and Syrian governments dismissed the document, which was first described Tuesday in the Israeli daily Haaretz. They said they were not involved in the talks, which included sessions from September 2004 to July 2006 at undisclosed sites in Europe.  ''No one in the government was involved in this matter,'' Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel said. ''It was a private initiative.''  In Syria, Bushra Kanafani, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, told the Arab satellite network Al Jazeera that the Israeli report was ''mere fabrication and a test balloon.''  Israel and Syria last held formal peace talks in 2000, when they appeared close to a deal to return most or all of the Golan Heights to Syria. But the negotiations broke down, and the two countries routinely trade recriminations.  Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and later annexed it. Today, about 20,000 Israelis live in the Golan Heights, a sparsely populated region that includes farms, vineyards and tourist sites. It is considered to have strategic military value, rising far above both northern Israel and southern Syria.  With formal diplomatic efforts stalled in 2004, Alon Liel, a former director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, quietly began unofficial talks with Ibrahim Suleiman, a well-connected Syrian businessman who has been living near Washington.  Turkey helped to arrange the initial contacts, and an unidentified European mediator was involved in the talks throughout, Haaretz reported.  The document, written last summer, calls for Syria to regain the Golan Heights based on the border that existed before the 1967 war. While no timetable was set for an Israeli withdrawal, Haaretz reported that the two sides discussed 5 to 15 years.  The heights, which overlook much of northern Israel, would be demilitarized except for a limited police presence, the document says. A park would be established in the Golan Heights, and Israelis would be allowed to visit, without a visa, in daylight hours, the document says.  It says Israel would maintain water rights on the upper Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee.  The two countries would also establish normal diplomatic relations.  The talks and the document they produced resemble the Geneva Initiative of 2003, in which former Israeli and Palestinian government officials, acting on their own, wrote a symbolic political agreement. Neither the Israeli nor the Palestinian government accepted it. Mr. Liel emphasized that he had acted entirely in a private capacity.

            "fulltext": "Attacks by militants crossing into Afghanistan from Pakistan have tripled since September along portions of the border, a senior American intelligence official said Tuesday, prompting calls for a greater effort by Pakistan to curb the influx and a larger deployment of American and other NATO soldiers here.  Of particular concern, officials said, has been a rise in attacks by Taliban and other militants from remote and largely ungoverned tribal areas in Pakistan in eastern Afghanistan, where most of the American combat forces in the country are based.  ''The border area is a problem,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told reporters after meeting on Tuesday with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. Mr. Gates said more attacks were coming from across the border and from ''Al Qaeda networks operating across the border.''  On his first visit to Afghanistan since taking office six weeks ago, Mr. Gates flew by helicopter to a small joint American-Afghan base in Khost Province, less than a mile from the border.  A senior American military intelligence officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said cross-border attacks had tripled in that part of the border region.  Staff Sgt. Ronald Locklear, one of the 120 American soldiers at the base, said fighters based in Pakistan ''cross the border on a regular basis.'' He said the base was being hit by rocket and mortar fire at least once a week. Officials said they had evidence that Pakistani border guards ignored infiltration of Taliban fighters.  The senior American commander in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, told reporters after meeting with Mr. Gates that he was hopeful that the Bush administration would seek a much larger aid package from Congress for the training of Afghanistan security forces and for reconstruction projects.  Other officials said that the total budget request was likely to be at least twice last year's level of nearly $3 billion, but that the exact number had not been determined.  The resurgence in attacks by Taliban fighters and other militants began last summer and has continued in eastern Afghanistan even this winter, when fighting would normally subside, officials said.  While praising Pakistan as a ''strong ally,'' Mr. Gates said the border problem ''clearly has to be pursued with the Pakistani government.''  General Eikenberry said that the ''enemy is using both sides of the border'' and that even after five years of pressing the Pakistani government to shut down Taliban infiltration, ''there is no easy solution to the problem.''  American commanders say the surge in cross-border attacks has coincided with an agreement reached last September in which the Pakistani government pulled back its soldiers in the North Waziristan region in return for a pledge from tribal elders not to shelter militants or allow them to engage in illegal behavior.  In the two months before the agreement, the senior American intelligence official said, there were 40 cross-border attacks in Khost and Paktika Provinces. But in the two months after the agreement there were 140 attacks.  Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has sent 80,000 troops into the Waziristan tribal areas. On Tuesday, shortly before Mr. Gates arrived on the Afghan side of the border, General Musharraf's military announced that it had destroyed three compounds in South Waziristan used by militants as hide-outs.  In a strike shortly before 7 a.m., helicopters hovering above a complex of five compounds fired a volley of missiles, Pakistani officials said. Three compounds were destroyed, but officials gave different figures for the number of dead.  A security official in Peshawar said at least 20 militants had been killed. Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, the chief military spokesman, said 25 to 30 had been killed. But later he told state-run television that the airstrike had killed ''eight militants, along with their local supporters.''  He said that no ground troops had been involved and that ''no high-value targets were believed to be there,'' a reference to top Qaeda leaders like Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri.  Eight bodies were retrieved from the rubble, five of them Afghans and three from the local Kikari Mehsud tribe. Ten wounded people were taken to private hospitals in North Waziristan, officials said.  Addressing a military conference in Rawalpindi, General Musharraf reiterated his resolve to fight terrorism and militancy in his country. ''Any hide-out or sanctuary being used by terrorists or miscreants shall be knocked out, wherever it is found,'' the state-run news agency quoted him as saying.  In Afghanistan, General Eikenberry, who is leaving his post this month as the senior American commander in the country, said American and NATO troops as well as Afghan Army units had inflicted heavy casualties on the Taliban, which he said remained too weak to undertake anything other than hit-and-run attacks or suicide bombings.  The American military intelligence officer disclosed for the first time statistics on the rise in insurgent attacks last year. There were 139 suicide attacks, up from 27 in 2005, and use of roadside bombs more than doubled, to 1,677 last year from from 783 in 2005. The number of what the military calls ''direct attacks,'' meaning attacks by insurgents using small arms, grenades and other weapons, increased to 4,542 last year from 1,558 in 2005.  But even with 21,000 American troops and an additional 20,000 soldiers from other NATO countries, military officials are pushing for more forces before spring, when the Taliban is widely expected to intensify its attacks.  General Eikenberry is seeking to extend the deployment of a 1,200-soldier American battalion, which is halfway through a four-month deployment. The unit, part of the 10th Mountain Division, based in Fort Drum, N.Y., is scheduled to go to Iraq in eight months, but General Eikenberry has argued that he needs the unit to remain in Afghanistan.  Asked about increasing American troop levels in Afghanistan, Mr. Gates said that if military commanders sought more, ''I would be strongly inclined to recommend that to the president.''  He also urged other NATO counties to fulfill their pledges to send more troops and equipment to Afghanistan. NATO governments still have not sent the additional 1,200 troops that Gen. David Richards, the British commander of NATO forces here, has requested to serve as a reserve force he can send wherever violence flares around Afghanistan, according Mark Laity, a NATO spokesman.",

            "fulltext": "Iraqi forces backed by American helicopters and tanks battled hundreds of gunmen hiding in a date palm orchard near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday, exchanging fire for 15 hours in what appeared to be one of Iraq's deadliest battles in years, Iraqi officials said.  An American helicopter was shot down and 250 bodies were found where the clashes occurred near the village of Zarqaa, about 120 miles south of Baghdad, by a river and a large grain silo that is surrounded by orchards, the Iraqi officials said.  Col. Ali Numaas, a spokesman for the Iraqi security forces in Najaf, said that the fighting stopped just after 10 p.m. local time and that most of those killed were gunmen. An employee at a local morgue said at least two Iraqi policemen were among the dead.  The United States military confirmed in a statement that the helicopter went down, that two soldiers aboard were killed, and that their bodies had been recovered. The crash is under investigation.  Asad Abu Ghalal, the governor of Najaf Province, said that the fighters in the orchard were Iraqi and foreign, some wearing the brown, white and maroon regalia of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. He said they had come to assassinate Shiite clerics and attack religious convoys that are gathering in Najaf, one of Shiite Islam's holiest cities, and other southern cities for Ashura, a Shiite holiday that starts Monday night and runs through Tuesday morning.  At a news conference Sunday afternoon, he said they called themselves ''soldiers of heaven'' and seemed to be part of a wider effort to disrupt Ashura. The holiday commemorates the seventh-century death of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson Hussein in a battle at Karbala, where hundreds of thousands of pilgrims have already started gathering.  Two senior Shiite clerics said, however, that the gunmen were part of a Shiite splinter group that Saddam Hussein helped build in the 1990s to compete with followers of the venerated religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. They said the group, calling itself the Mehwadiya, was loyal to Ahmad bin al-Hassan al-Basri, an Iraqi cleric who had a falling out with Muhammad Bakr al-Sadr -- father-in-law of the Shiite leader Moktada al-Sadr -- in Hawza, a revered Shiite seminary in Najaf.  The clerics spoke on condition of anonymity because they said they had been ordered not to discuss Shiite divisions.  Iraqi officials said the group of 100 to 500 fighters was discovered in the orchard Saturday night, leading to a midnight meeting of local authorities who hatched an attack plan.  ''We agreed to carry out an operation to take them by surprise,'' said Mr. Ghalal, the Najaf governor.  At dawn, the governor said, the area was surrounded and the offensive began. He said the fighters had antiaircraft rockets and long-range sniper rifles, and, according to a soldier involved in the fighting, Iraqi security forces encountered heavy resistance. Commanders called for reinforcements and a brigade of soldiers from nearby Babil Province joined the fight.  Eventually, Iraqi officials said, they called on the United States military for help. American tanks and helicopter gunships arrived, and gun battles continued into the night. By 10:30 p.m., the gunfire had died down and Iraqi troops began searching the area for bodies.  Elsewhere in the heavily Shiite south, there were other signs of potential strikes on Ashura. Officials in Karbala said that police arrested three men Sunday -- a Saudi Arabian, an Afghan and a Moroccan -- who were found on the road between Najaf and Karbala with a suicide bomb belt and explosives in their car. They said the vehicle had been hollowed out so it could be used as a car bomb.  The United States military also announced the deaths of a soldier and a marine.  The marine died Saturday from combat wounds in Anbar Province, where American troops have been battling Sunni insurgents for months. The soldier, a member of the military police, was killed when a roadside bomb exploded near his patrol north of Baghdad on Saturday.  Throughout Iraq, the daily violence continued.  In Kirkuk, two car bombs at a Kurdish car dealership and a Kurdish market killed at least 17 people, authorities said.  In Baghdad, 54 bodies were found, many showing signs of torture. At least five girls were killed and 20 wounded when a mortar round hit a school in the Sunni Adil neighborhood.  At 7:30 a.m. local time, a bomb inside a minibus exploded in a Shiite area of the capital east of the Tigris River, killing one and wounding five. Two hours later, in the Sunni area of Yarmouk in west Baghdad, gunmen killed four people, including a consultant with Iraq's Ministry of Industry and his daughter, who were shot on their way to work.  After dark on Sunday night, residents of the Yarmouk neighborhood reported that heavy clashes had broken out, with gun and mortar fire raining down for hours.  Also on Sunday, Saddam Hussein's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid acknowledged in court that he had given orders to destroy scores of villages during Iraq's campaign against the Kurds in the 1980s. Prosecutors introduced two dozen documents it said incriminated members of the Hussein regime in the killing of tens of thousands of Kurds.  The Associated Press reported that Mr. Majid, also known as Chemical Ali for his alleged use of chemical weapons against the Kurds, said the area ''was full of Iranian agents,'' and, ''We had to isolate these saboteurs.''  ''I am the one who gave orders to the army to demolish villages and relocate the villagers,'' he said, according to The A.P.  Mr. Majid is one of six defendants facing charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from Baghdad's military campaign against Iraqi Kurds during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. More than 100,000 Kurds were killed.",

The man, a paroled sex offender, is now suspected of abducting and raping a 17-year-old girl just two hours after the complaint, the police said.  The officers, who have not been identified by the police, are assigned to the 101st Precinct in Queens, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.  The suspect, Eric McCoy, was arrested on Jan. 3 and has been charged with committing two rapes in Queens in a little more than four weeks. In each case, he posed as a police officer and raped his victims inside motel rooms, the police said.  In the first assault, which occurred on Dec. 4, Mr. McCoy abducted a woman, 27, as she was getting off a bus in Jamaica and forced her to a motel, the police said. In the second episode, the authorities said, Mr. McCoy approached a 17-year-old girl on Jan. 2 in Kew Gardens and identified himself as a ''police special investigator.'' He said he had a gun and took her to a motel where he raped her, the police said.  Hours before the second rape, Mr. McCoy had told a 15-year-old girl that he was a police officer investigating an assault. After showing her a fake badge, he told her to wait inside a laundry. Inside, she talked about the encounter with a woman, who called 911, the police said.  Once the police arrived, Mr. McCoy approached the squad car and told the officers that two girls had been in a fight. When the girl came to the car, they asked whether she had been fighting. They told her to get into the car, drove her to a subway station and told her to go to school, the authorities said.  The officers failed to check whether Mr. McCoy had a criminal record and, apparently, to question others at the scene, the police said. Mr. McCoy was arrested after one victim remembered that he had identified himself as ''Investigator McCoy.''",

            "fulltext": "A Queens grand jury that will weigh evidence in the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man on his wedding day in November will begin hearing testimony next week, lawyers involved in the case said yesterday.  Two months after the unarmed man, Sean Bell, was killed and two of his friends were wounded in a fusillade of 50 police bullets, prosecutors are expected to begin presenting evidence and calling witnesses before the panel, the lawyers said.  ''My understanding is that they should begin presenting on Monday,'' said Michael Hardy, a lawyer who represents the woman Mr. Bell was to marry, Nicole Paultre Bell (she took his name after his death), and the two men wounded in the shooting.  The office of the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, declined to comment or answer questions about the grand jury process. ''The investigation is continuing,'' said Meris Campbell, a spokeswoman.  Mr. Hardy, lawyers representing some of the five officers involved in the shooting and others said they expected the grand jury's work would last at least three weeks. The two men wounded in the Nov. 25 shooting, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, intend to testify, said Mr. Hardy, and will most likely do so toward the end of the grand jury process.  ''They are crucial witnesses,'' he said. ''And that, obviously, will present a very significant challenge to whatever testimony is given by the officers who did the shooting, if any.''  Of the officers who fired at Mr. Bell, two are black, one is black and Hispanic, and two are white.  In recent weeks, four of the five officers have given investigators for the Queens district attorney's office their version of events. The fifth, Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, has not spoken to prosecutors, according to one lawyer involved in the case.  But it remained unclear yesterday if Detective Oliver planned to testify before the grand jury or speak with prosecutors, and his lawyer did not return phone calls seeking comment.  Paul P. Martin, a lawyer who represents Detective Marc Cooper, said his client would testify before the grand jury. ''My client's actions were reasonable under the circumstances and justified,'' he said.  It is unclear if Detective Paul Headley will testify. A lawyer for another officer, the undercover detective who fired the first of the 50 shots, has said his client intended to testify. Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer for Officer Michael Carey, said he was ''reserving judgment'' on whether his client would testify.  Officers who face grand juries in Queens can find themselves in one of several rooms that look like college lecture halls, with seats in tiered rows. There are some grand juries that sit for a month at a time, and one that sits for six months, though each can be extended. It is unclear which type will hear the Bell case.",

It was unclear how the dispute, which apparently began with a honked horn, escalated to gunfire.  The shooting took place shortly after 7 p.m. when the officer, identified by the State Department of Correctional Services as Emilio Maldonado, 29, stopped his car behind a sport utility vehicle at a stoplight at Ditmars Avenue and 94th Street, investigators said. After the light turned green, Mr. Maldonado apparently honked his horn.  The police said two men who were in the sport utility vehicle got out and approached Mr. Maldonado's car, where he was sitting with his wife and child, the police said. The two men and Mr. Maldonado got into a dispute, perhaps involving a struggle for the officer's gun, investigators said. Mr. Maldonado fired one shot, hitting one of the men in the chest.  The person who was shot, identified only as a 36-year-old man, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he later died, the police said. The other man, also not identified, fled the scene, according to the police, who said he was later caught and taken to the 115th Precinct station house for questioning. The correction officer was also being questioned by the police last night.  Mr. Maldonado works at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, the state's only maximum security prison for women, according to Linda Foglia, a spokeswoman for the Department of Correctional Services. She said that Mr. Maldonado's personal weapon was registered with the department.  ''They are able to carry their guns when they are off-duty,'' Ms. Foglia said. ''They are peace officers. They have the ability to make arrests.''  She added: ''They are required to register their weapon with our agency and he did so. So on our end, he is following the appropriate procedures.''",

(AP) -- The state attorney general's office agreed Saturday to take over the sexual assault case against three Duke University lacrosse players at the request of the embattled district attorney.  Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong, hamstrung by a flip-flopping witness and dogged by allegations that he made inflammatory statements to the media, asked Attorney General Roy Cooper's office Friday to appoint a special prosecutor.  \"I wish I could tell you this case would be resolved quickly,\" Cooper said at a news conference Saturday. \"Since we have not been involved in the investigation and prosecution, all of the information will be new to our office. Any case with such serious criminal charges will require careful review.\"  Cooper pledged that his office would not comment on details of the case as officials review the investigation and the charges of sexual assault and kidnapping against Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty and David Evans.  Nifong's comments to reporters in the early days of the case led the State Bar to charge him last month with several ethics violations. Nifong's attorney said Friday the conflict of interest those charges created led the veteran prosecutor to ask the state to take over.

Scientists studied data on 11,860 families from the National Immunization Survey, a nationwide survey of vaccination among children 19 to 35 months old that includes information on race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.  Children of mothers who had not completed high school were 16 percent more likely to have up-to-date vaccinations than children of college graduates. While black children were 11 percent less likely to be up to date than white children, Hispanic children were 11 percent more likely. The poorest children, without considering race or ethnicity, were just as likely as the richest to have completed their vaccination schedule.  ''The way the health care system is organized for immunization services may account for the variations,'' said Jennie J. Kronenfeld, the senior author of the study. ''Or cultural differences may overcome the barriers to immunization that they don't in other kinds of health care.''  Dr. Kronenfeld, a professor of sociology in the School of Social and Family Dynamics at Arizona State University, offered a possible explanation for the difference between the children of college graduates and those of mothers who had not graduated from high school. ''There is a controversy among more educated mothers about the safety of certain kinds of immunization,'' she said. ''That may be part of what is going on here, but we don't know for sure.''

Vitamin B12 reduces the blood levels of homocysteine, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the reduction apparently has no effect on survival.  The review covered 12 studies with 16,598 participants who had pre-existing illness. All of the studies showed a reduction in homocysteine levels in people who took folate supplements, but there was no correlation between the amount of reduction in blood levels of homocysteine and the risk of heart attacks, coronary heart disease, stroke or mortality from any cause, and no difference between those who took folate supplements and the participants in control groups who took none.  ''We haven't found any magical supplement pills to prevent cardiovascular disease,'' said Dr. Lydia A. Bazzano, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.  ''The things people have to do are hard; they have to quit smoking, exercise, lose weight, eat properly,'' Dr. Bazzano continued. ''This means getting omega-3 fatty acids and a well-balanced diet in terms of carbohydrates and proteins. And eating fruits and vegetables is always good. No one has been able to contradict that yet.''  The study, published in the Dec. 13 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, covered only people who were already ill with vascular disease, but the authors wrote that no randomized, controlled trials have shown a beneficial effect of B12 supplements in preventing vascular disease in healthy people, either.

Tympanostomy, or the insertion of tubes to drain the fluid and improve hearing, is one of the most common pediatric operations and is generally believed to help prevent developmental problems. But this study, published on Jan. 18 in The New England Journal of Medicine, suggests that tubes in otherwise healthy children has no effect on development through age 11.  The researchers studied 429 children younger than 2 months with persistent episodes of fluid in the middle ear. The children were randomly assigned in a clinical trial to undergo tympanostomy promptly or six to nine months later. At the same time, researchers randomly selected a comparison group of 241 children who had persistent fluid in their ears but were not eligible for the clinical trial; almost none of those children received ear tubes.  Examinations at ages 9 to 11 with tests of hearing, speech and academic skills showed no significant difference between the children who received early tube placement and those who received later placement. Among the children not eligible for the trial, correlations between the duration of episodes of fluid in the ear for various periods in the first three years of life and developmental outcomes at ages 9 to 11 were generally insignificant.  ''These findings do not apply to children with acute infections,'' said Dr. Jack L. Paradise, the lead author and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh. ''But with children whose only problem is fluid in the ear, we should be conservative and wait at least a year before considering tubes.''  VITAL SIGNS: CHILD CARE",

Researchers gave 15 volunteers 1,000 milligrams of Echinacea purpurea daily for 10 days. They collected stool samples before the supplementation, and at 10 days and 17 to 18 days after the volunteers had stopped taking the herb, then analyzed the samples for six types of bacteria. The study was published in December in The Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics.  After controlling for other diet variables, the scientists found significant increases in microbial counts for Bacteroides, Bacteroides fragilis, and total aerobic bacteria. There was no effect on enteric bacteria, enterococci, Lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, or total anaerobic bacteria.  ''This changes the balance of the normal bacterial fauna,'' said Jerald C. Foote, an assistant professor of human nutrition at the University of Arkansas. ''But we don't know yet what this means.''  Though the sample was small and the study was preliminary, the authors said it was the first to consider the effects of a botanical dietary supplement on gastrointestinal flora. Dr. Foote was not urging anyone to abandon echinacea. ''I think we need a lot more research before we start taking echinacea off the shelves,'' he said. ''But this does raise some questions.''

Researchers randomly selected 5,008 people older than 50 and followed them for five years. At the start of the study, they interviewed the subjects about medications and general health. The subjects filled out yearly questionnaires reporting fractures caused by falling from a bed, chair or standing height. (A co-author of the study has received grants and honorariums from several drug companies.)  One hundred and thirty-seven people, or 2.7 percent of the subjects, were daily users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, a rate similar to that of the general populations of the United States and Canada. After controlling for the use of other psychotropic medicines, age, sex, education, height, weight, smoking status and other variables, daily users of S.S.R.I.'s were 2.1 times as likely to suffer fractures as those who did not use the medicine. The study  appears in the Jan. 22 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.  ''We're not recommending that people stop their S.S.R.I.'s,'' said Dr. David Goltzman, a professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal and the senior author of the study. ''But people should realize that this is a risk and that they might want to undertake lifestyle changes like participating in exercise and making sure their diet is appropriate in calcium and vitamin D.''  Using S.S.R.I.'s was also associated with an increased risk of falls and with decreased mineral bone density. But after controlling for falls and low bone density, the risk of fracture persisted. The scientists speculated that other pathways leading to impaired bone quality might be at work.  VITAL SIGNS: HAZARDS",

Researchers compared blood levels of LDL cholesterol in 124 Parkinson's patients with a control group of 112 of their healthy spouses. Compared with people in the highest one-quarter in LDL levels, those in the lower 75 percent were two to three and a half times as likely to suffer from Parkinson's. There was no association between Parkinson's and levels of HDL cholesterol.  Normally, having a low LDL level is a healthy sign. But does this mean that having a higher LDL is actually a good thing? Absolutely not, said Dr. Xuemei Huang, the lead author of the study.  ''If a person is healthy with a cholesterol in the middle range, and no family history of heart disease, radically lowering cholesterol may not be necessary,'' she said. ''But at the same time, we're not urging anyone to change his diet or medication based on this finding.'' Dr. Huang is a Parkinson's expert and a neurologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.  The findings, based on retrospective data, could not demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between a low level of LDL and Parkinson's, the authors said. The paper was published online Dec. 18 in the journal Movement Disorders.  Men and women in the study who used cholesterol-lowering drugs were about a third as likely to have Parkinson's as those who did not use the drugs. This finding led researchers to suggest that testing the effect of statins on neurodegenerative disease with a much larger sample of patients could be useful.  VITAL SIGNS: AT RISK",

Researchers followed 965 Medicare recipients 65 or older for an average of six years, administering diet questionnaires to estimate their intake of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, and performing medical examinations at about 18-month intervals. Members of the study group lived in northern Manhattan, were largely Hispanic and black, and had high levels of diabetes, hypertension and other vascular risk factors. Alzheimer's developed in 192 of them.  After adjusting for age, hypertension, current smoking and other variables, those in the highest one-quarter in total folate intake, from both diet and supplements, were 50 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's than those in the lowest one-quarter. There was no significant association of Alzheimer's risk with dietary folate alone, or with vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 intake.  Dr. Jos\u00e9 A. Luchsinger, the lead author and an assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at Columbia, said there was nothing definitive in these results.  ''This study is observational, not a clinical trial,'' he said. ''It builds evidence and suggests hypotheses, but should not be used to recommend treatment.''  The authors, writing in the January issue of The Archives of Neurology, suggest that folate lowers blood levels of homocysteine, which may decrease the risk of brain atrophy. It may also be that folate reduces the risk for cerebrovascular disease, which is another potential pathway for Alzheimer's.  VITAL SIGNS: RISK REDUCTION",

Researchers randomly assigned 818 men and women ages 50 to 70 to take a daily oral dose of 800 micrograms of folic acid or a placebo. All the subjects, who were otherwise healthy, had elevated blood levels of homocysteine, which has in previous studies been associated with poor cognitive performance.  All the subjects took five tests of mental functioning. At the beginning of the study, there was no significant difference in the scores between the groups. But at the end, after controlling for cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass, smoking status and other variables, the folic acid group performed significantly better on three of the five mental tests, and their average for all tests was significantly higher.  Although the lead author, Jane Durga, affirmed that the study was carefully randomized and controlled, she said, ''Based on this paper alone, I wouldn't be waving it around'' to urge people to supplement their diets.  ''Although this is a high-quality study,'' she continued, ''it needs to be repeated in other populations like in the U.S., where there is already folic acid fortification.''  By law, flour in the United States is fortified with folic acid to help prevent neural tube defects in newborns.  ''This is only the first study that shows this effect,'' Dr. Durga said. ''There need to be studies that look at lower doses or increasing natural folates, which may lead to similar or even greater effects.''

Researchers gathered blood samples from 7,429 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii from 1967 to 1975 to determine whether they were infected with Helicobacter pylori, a childhood infection known to increase the risk for stomach cancer much later in life. They followed the men for 28 years, during which 261 developed gastric cancer.  From that group, the researchers selected the cases of those infected with H. pylori -- 239, or 92 percent -- and compared them with a group of cancer-free, but also infected, controls. The team then looked at family size and birth order in both groups.  Among the cases with the most the virulent strain of H. pylori, called cagA, those from families with seven or more children were more than twice as likely to develop cancer as those from families with one to three children, and younger children had a higher risk than older ones.  The study appears in the January issue of PloS Medicine.  ''It's remarkable that something that's happening in the early years of life affects the risk of a cancer happening seven decades later,'' said Dr. Martin J. Blaser, the lead author and a professor of medicine at New York University. ''It's my hypothesis that this may be a model system for other cancers.''  The authors acknowledge that some factor other than family size or birth order may be the cause of the findings. But they suggest that the germ is transmitted among siblings, and that the immature immune systems of younger children may make them more susceptible.  VITAL SIGNS: AT RISK",

Researchers recorded the sex of the offspring of 38,934 Israeli men who had children from 1964 to 1976, and then followed the fathers through 2005, during which time 712 developed prostate cancer. After adjusting for other variables, they found that those with no sons were almost one and a half times as likely to have developed the disease as those with at least one son. The more daughters they had without having any sons, the more their risk increased.  Because the inability to produce male children is associated with alterations in the Y chromosome, this suggests that the chromosome may be involved in prostate cancer risk.  Still, said Dr. Susan Harlap, the lead author and a professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia, ''The main reason a man has male or female children, even in runs of one sex, is chance.'' She said she did not recommend extra prostate screening for men with only daughters.  The researchers acknowledge that their study, published Jan. 3 in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, gathered no information about family history of prostate cancer. In addition, they studied a specific group of men, and it may not be possible to generalize the results to other populations.  ''Prostate cancer is a huge mystery,'' Dr. Harlap said, ''not like lung or colon cancer, where we have a pretty good idea about causes.

Researchers at the University of Michigan Health System have found that almost a third of the children who needed surgery there over a four-year period were overweight. Of those, more than half could be considered obese. The study appears in the current Journal of the National Medical Association.  The researchers, led by Dr. Olubukola O. Nafiu, said it was widely accepted among surgeons and anesthesiologists that obese adult patients presented ''enormous'' challenges. With a threefold increase in weight problems among American children and adolescents over the past three decades, they said, doctors who operate on younger patients are already facing the same issues.  In adult patients, surgery is often complicated by other illnesses brought on by obesity, like diabetes and high blood pressure. ''Unfortunately,'' the study said, ''many of these co-morbidities are becoming prevalent in obese children.''  The extra weight in itself can cause difficulties, including maintaining open air passages for patients who are anesthetized. There is also evidence that in overweight people, surgical wounds are more likely to become infected.  The researchers looked at operations performed on more than 6,000 children at a University of Michigan hospital from 2000 to 2004. Weight problems were found at all ages, but especially when the children were 8 to 12.

The scene in this sunny suite in the basement of Edison, an elementary school, is being replayed daily as one of the newest full-service school health clinics in Westchester County treats not only hundreds of children when they are sick or injured, but also provides checkups, immunizations, obesity counseling and dental care.  In the past two years, school-based health care in the county has grown in popularity at schools the state considers to be in need.

Mount Vernon and Port Chester are considering opening even more clinics.  ''If we had enough resources and time, I'd like to see school-based health services in every school,'' said Dr. Joshua Lipsman, the county health commissioner.

Two weeks earlier, she had had a dental emergency, an infected tooth that required antibiotics.  ''I liked the dentist,'' Madelin said. ''She told me she would only tickle my teeth, not take them out. And she did just tickle them.''  Edison's principal, Eileen Santiago, said that 70 percent of her students had never seen a dentist before the clinic opened. ''Children were coming to school with Anbesol in their lunchboxes for toothaches because their teeth hadn't been taken care of in so long,'' Dr. Santiago said.  Lorraine Tiezzi, a specialist in school-based primary care at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, said that when parents get to know their school-based clinic, they have peace of mind that their child is being cared for, which helps them to be productive at work.

When her father, Edwin Alonzo, 31, came to get her, she buried her face in the leg of his dusty work pants.  ''I think it's wonderful to have a clinic inside here,'' Mr. Alonzo, a mason, said in Spanish.

In the past two years, school-based health care in the county has grown in popularity at schools the state considers to be in need.

Beginning in 1986, researchers followed 11,711 male health professionals previously given diagnoses of hypertension, using a questionnaire about diet, alcohol consumption and medical history every four years. The study, which followed the men through 2002, appears in The Annals of Internal Medicine.  During 16 years of follow-up, the study recorded 653 heart attacks, of which 279 were fatal. There was little difference between abstainers and those who consumed up to 4.9 grams of alcohol per day. But after adjusting for age, smoking, the use of blood pressure medication and other factors, men who consumed 15 to 29.9 grams a day -- the equivalent of one to two drinks -- lowered their risk for fatal heart attack by 30 percent. The more alcohol they consumed, the more they reduced their risk, by up to 60 percent for those who consumed more than 50 grams a day.  ''In no way does this suggest that people should be drinking more than three drinks a day,'' said Eric B. Rimm, a co-author of the study and an associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''But the results do suggest that people who have hypertension have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease if they drink moderately.''  Alcohol consumption also lowered the risk for nonfatal heart attack, but it did not affect the risk of death from cardiovascular disease or death from all causes.  The authors acknowledge that their data depends on self-reports, which are not always reliable. Dr. Rimm received an honorarium two years ago from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.

The recommendations cover two new vaccines for teenagers: one for the virus that causes cervical cancer and the other for a bacterium that causes meningitis and other diseases.  The agency has updated its recommended list of vaccines several times over the past 15 years, always after lengthy debate. Each state, rather than the C.D.C., decides which vaccines to make compulsory for entry into school. And some new vaccines are recommended rather than required because their prices are so high.  The timing of injections is complex, and must be overseen by a doctor.

The study found that, while older girls use such sites the most, older boys are more likely to meet new people through them. Sixty percent of older boys, for example, say they use the sites to make new friends, while only 46 percent of older girls do. And older boys are more than twice as likely to say they use the sites to flirt.  ''Older boys are much more expansive in their use of the sites,'' said Amanda Lenhart, one of the study's two authors. ''I believe that it has a lot to do with socialization. A lot of the media messages about safety tend to be aimed more at girls than boys.''

            "fulltext": "A racing pulse, a tendency to startle at loud noises, nightmares and flashbacks -- these are the familiar symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. But a new study suggests that combat veterans who suffer from the disorder may also be at increased risk for heart attacks and fatal coronary heart disease.  The study is the first to suggest that the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or P.T.S.D., may actually be a cause of heart disease. And the more severe the symptoms of P.T.S.D., the researchers found, the greater the risk for disease.  The analysis was based on data from 1,946 veterans participating in a continuing study. The men, whose average age at the start of the study was about 62, had no pre-existing heart problems. Beginning in 1986, they were followed for more than 10 years, with periodic physical examinations and the updating of their medical records. Two self-administered scales were used to assess the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and to estimate their severity.  Over the course of the study, which appears in the January issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, 255 of the men developed either nonfatal heart attacks, fatal coronary heart disease or angina pectoris, the chest pain associated with heart problems.  The number and severity of the veterans' symptoms were significantly associated with nonfatal heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease, and somewhat less strongly linked to angina.  These results, the authors suggest, mean that people with more symptoms of the stress disorder are not simply prone to reporting aches and pains but actually at higher risk for disease.  ''In this sample, symptom levels were actually low to moderate,'' said Laura D. Kubzansky, the lead author and an assistant professor of society, human development and health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''So the fact that we have evidence of risk at these levels means that at even higher levels of symptomatology, where people might be significantly distressed and meet diagnostic criteria for P.T.S.D., you would expect to see even higher levels of risk.''  The exact mechanism through which post-traumatic stress might affect heart health is not known, but some researchers have suggested that the stress-caused release of hormones called catecholamines may lead to injury of the coronary arteries by altering blood flow or setting off chemical changes in the body. These hormones may also encourage the release of fatty acids that can be harmful to the heart.  The new study, the authors say, is the first to demonstrate an association between heart disease and symptoms of post-traumatic stress while controlling for many of the variables that might affect risk, including depression, smoking, a family history of heart disease, cholesterol levels and alcohol consumption.  The researchers acknowledge that the study's findings pertain largely to older white men who served in the military and therefore cannot be generalized to women, nonwhite men or civilians. Also, the data on psychological symptoms (although not on heart disease) depend on self-reports by the veterans rather than on interviews by doctors, and therefore may be less reliable.  The fact that the researchers determined the presence of post-traumatic stress before the onset of any heart disease strengthens the findings, they said, because it eliminates the problems of recall bias, when people erroneously attribute an illness to some unconnected event or anxiety in the past.  For a long time, Dr. Kubzansky said, people have assumed that those with anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder were simply more likely than others to report pain, and that the pain might not be real.  But the new findings, she continued, ''suggest that there are significant cardiotoxic effects of these disorders beyond just a sense of discomfort or pain.  ''We should be concerned about P.T.S.D. because it's a bad outcome in and of itself,'' she said. ''But this makes an even stronger argument that we should pay attention to those who have it to make sure they don't develop further problems down the road.''",

That opportunity is now, and while Mr. Spitzer has lots of other big things on his agenda -- health care, tax policy, education -- he needs first to convince his fellow state officials that they need to clean up the State Capitol.

Take today in Washington, for example, where things will be happening on two fronts. The afternoon brings a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a platform that could display the sharply contrasting views on Iraq of Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York. The evening brings the president's State of the Union address, which many Democrats -- notably Mrs. Clinton -- view as providing an opportunity to tee off to advance their own presidential campaigns.  For the rest of the week, attention in the Senate will be focused on resolutions critical of President Bush's Iraq policy, giving a platform to other presidential hopefuls, including Senators Barack Obama of Illinois, Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, both Democrats, and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Republican who is considering running. Antiwar activists are planning a big demonstration in Washington on Saturday, an event that could provide the candidates another gauge of public sentiment against the war.  But the action is not limited to Washington. At week's end, Mrs. Clinton is making her first trip to Iowa since creating her presidential exploratory committee; it seems fair to surmise that this will not be the kind of small living-room chats -- with 10 Democrats and a local reporter or two -- that have put the state on the political map. Halfway across the country, Mrs. Clinton's former and potential future political rival, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, will be competing for attention by heading for New Hampshire, a trip that was planned before Mrs. Clinton decided to spend the same weekend in Des Moines.

            "fulltext": "The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations.  The Senate president, Richard J. Codey, said he also planned to introduce measures that would ban political contributions by public entities, step up ethics training for lawmakers and their aides and provide full disclosure for expenditures that are added to the state's budget at the last minute.  Mr. Codey said the measures, which he hoped would pass by the end of the legislative session on July 1, would bolster public confidence in elected officials in a state that has seen more than 200 federal corruption convictions in the past five years.  ''There are certain things we can do,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We've got to make sure that we're up to speed on these progressive measures.''  Mr. Codey said he did not expect resistance to the measures, largely because each of the 120 seats in the State Legislature is up for election in November and lawmakers will be reluctant to appear soft on public corruption in a state weary of scandal.  Of the seven bills proposed by Mr. Codey on Thursday, the two most significant concern the acceptance of gifts by lawmakers and increased transparency in the state's budget process. Currently, legislators and their staff members are allowed to accept gifts valued up to $250. Mr. Codey is seeking a complete prohibition on gifts.  Mr. Codey said his proposal for advance notification about 11th-hour budget additions would require lawmakers to submit a written request for changes to the governor's proposed budget 10 to 14 days before the Legislature considers the budget bill.  Several lawmakers called for such a measure last year when more than a quarter billion dollars in expenditures for pet projects were added to the $31 billion budget only hours before it was voted on.  Before approving the budget, which ended a seven-day shutdown of state government, Gov. Jon S. Corzine cut more than $51 million of those last-minute additions.  ''Senate President Codey should certainly be commended,'' Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Anthony Coley, said on Thursday. ''He has a partner in Governor Corzine on this.''  Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. also pledged his support and said he hoped the measures would ''help dispel some of the public's skepticism and cynicism about government.''  Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, the leader of the Republican minority in the Assembly, said many of the proposals mirrored ideas already submitted by Republicans in recent months. ''I hope Senate President Codey will also consider these ideas,'' Mr. DeCroce said.",

Governor Spitzer came to the North Shore of Long Island to endorse the candidacy of Craig Johnson, a Nassau County legislator, declaring that a vote for Mr. Johnson would be a vote for his agenda, which includes health and education reform, lower property taxes and greater government accountability.  ''This is very simply a thumbs up or a thumbs down on the reform agenda I laid out on the state of the State of the State on Jan. 3,'' Governor Spitzer told a gathering of about 200 supporters that included the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, whom he had opposed in the Democratic primary for governor. ''If you support that agenda, you must vote for Craig Johnson.''  The governor forced the opening when he chose State Senator Michael A. L. Balboni, a Republican, as his deputy homeland security director. A special election to fill the Senate vacancy will be held on Feb. 6.  The governor drew a laugh when he said that he had not seen ''this many Democrats in Manhasset in a long time.'' Later he said, ''This has nothing to do with partisan affiliation.''  That was an assertion that few Republicans believe. The race for the Seventh Senate District, where Democrats hold a slight edge, has given the Democratic Party a chance to gain a seat in the State Senate, which is controlled by Republicans with a 33 to 28 advantage.  Earlier this week, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, expressed his annoyance in an interview with The Associated Press.  ''I hope Eliot remembers what he said during the campaign and after the campaign about the campaigns being over and partnering with Republicans,'' Mr. Bruno said.  Responding to a reporter's question to the effect that Mr. Bruno had previously implied that the governor had been intrusive, Mr. Spitzer said: ''I've been called many things. Intrusive is not one of them.''  He said he intended to back other State Senate candidates who would support his agenda, regardless of party affiliation.  ''I really view it as an extension of the reform effort,'' he said. ''We are working across party lines. Anybody who cares about reform, we are working first and foremost with, because this is what the public wants. ''  Governor Spitzer emphasized his interest in creating a more transparent and accountable Legislature and ''an end to the lobbyists, who crawl all over the capital, making the decisions that should be made for the citizens and by the citizens.''  Governor Spitzer said Mr. Johnson would be the right candidate to further that cause. ''If we're going to restore honor and integrity to the government, we need men like Craig Johnson,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''We don't want the public looking at us, saying, 'Gee, we look at you askance because we don't trust the decisions you make.' ''  In turn, Mr. Johnson declared his support for the governor's agenda. ''I want to be there as your partner to push that reform agenda forward,'' he said.  The Republicans have chosen the Nassau County clerk, Maureen O'Connell, to oppose Mr. Johnson.",

''I'm happy to announce that President Bush has accepted our invitation to address the conference on Saturday morning,'' Mr. Emanuel wrote, adding that former President Bill Clinton would also be there.

He plans to outline his intentions on Don Imus's nationally syndicated radio and cable television shows, followed by a series of media interviews, they say.  Mr. Dodd was set to file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission this week establishing a campaign committee, his friends said, which would allow him to raise money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded primary field.  Beneva Schulte, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dodd, would not comment on his plans Wednesday evening.  Coverage of Mr. Dodd's announcement would be competing with that of President Bush's Wednesday night speech on Iraq.  Mr. Dodd, although well-known in Washington and his home state, does not have the kind of national name recognition of some other Democrats who are strongly considering entering the race, most prominently Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois.  John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina and vice-presidential nominee, has spent the last two years building support for his bid and is widely viewed as a strong candidate. And Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa have announced their candidacies. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the party's candidate in 2004, is also considering joining the race.  Mr. Dodd, 62, who is serving his fifth term in the Senate, is chairman of the Banking Committee and has spent much of the past several months shoring up support in states with early primaries, like New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina. From 1995 to 1997, he served as the general chairman of the Democratic party, which could prove helpful in fund-raising.  Some of the most recent presidential polls have left Mr. Dodd off the list, but his supporters say that his experience in the Senate could be a boost and that his personality would be an asset.  Mr. Dodd, who is also a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, has become a vocal critic of the war in Iraq, saying that his vote to authorize military action in 2002 was a mistake.

            "fulltext": "Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, an outspoken Republican critic of the administration's Iraq policy, will join two leading Democrats in introducing a resolution opposing President Bush's buildup of troops in Iraq, putting a bipartisan stamp on the looming Congressional showdown over the war.  Lawmakers and aides said Mr. Hagel had been consulting for the past few days with the two Democrats, Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to develop the wording of the resolution, which could be introduced as early as Wednesday.  ''Senator Levin, Senator Biden and I have been working together on it and we are pretty close,'' Mr. Hagel, a potential Republican presidential candidate, said Tuesday night as he left the Senate.  Mr. Hagel said the intent of the resolution was not to ''bash the president'' or to call for the immediate withdrawal of United States troops from Iraq, but a responsible way for senators to register their opinion on the increase of more than 20,000 additional troops announced by Mr. Bush last week.  While Senate opponents of the buildup were preparing to move forward, Senate Republicans backing the president were trying to map their own strategy, considering proposals that could appeal to Republicans frustrated with events in Iraq but keep them from supporting the most critical resolution.  ''There will be alternatives,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the third-ranking Senate Republican.  At the White House, officials were continuing to discuss the new plan with members of Congress, with an emphasis on lining up Republicans behind Mr. Bush's approach. ''We knew this was not going to be an easy policy to explain or one that was going to be met with open arms,'' said a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  That official said that the message to Congressional Republicans was similar to the one the White House spokesman, Tony Snow, conveyed Tuesday at his press briefing: that approval of any resolution critical of Mr. Bush's approach, even if nonbinding, would send a damaging message.  ''In an age of instant and global communication, what message does it send to the people who are fighting democracy in Iraq?'' asked Mr. Snow. ''And, also, what message does it send to the troops?''  Mr. Bush on Tuesday stepped up his challenge to Congress to provide an alternative plan if it is going to criticize his.  ''My only call to Congress is that if you've got a better way to succeed, step up and explain it,'' he said in an interview on ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. ''What's your prescription for success? And I think they owe that explanation to the American people.''  In the House, the Democratic leadership said it would wait for the Senate to act before bringing its own resolution up for a vote. ''We think it will be useful for the Senate to go first,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, who predicted a bipartisan vote in the House against the troop buildup.  Members of both parties in the Senate have said as many as a dozen Republicans may ultimately support a resolution against the president's policy. Mr. Hagel's participation could ease the concerns of other Republicans about breaking from the president.  But some Republicans, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, suggested that Republicans critical of the plan could be reluctant to cast such a clear vote in opposition to the president and might be willing to hold off until they hear from Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, the newly selected ground commander in Iraq.  The level of Democratic support for a resolution is not certain, though the overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats have expressed opposition to the buildup.  ''If they have the language right, I will be right there,'' said Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska.  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has promised to raise procedural arguments against any proposal he sees as undermining the president.  Mr. Hagel was brutally critical of the president's new strategy during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week and spent some time on the floor Tuesday night discussing the Iraq resolution privately with Mr. McConnell. But Mr. Hagel said he did not anticipate an angry reaction from his colleagues for joining with Democrats, since he had such a strong record of opposition on the issue.  White House officials have dismissed Mr. Hagel as an established critic of the war who is now seeking to stake out antiwar ground in the nascent Republican primary fight for president.  Still, the officials said in interviews that while they believed any substantial Republican support for the resolution would be a symbolic blow, they were far more concerned about threats from Congressional Democrats to take aim at spending on the president's new plan. Officials say that they will rely upon Mr. McConnell to help head off any such move.  THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ",

Mr. Dodd is calling himself the ''dark horse'' in a crowded race in which candidates, and would-be candidates, have been jockeying for early attention. Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois have dominated the spotlight so far, even though they have not officially declared their intentions.  And Mr. Dodd made somewhat of an odd pick by announcing the start of his campaign on Don Imus's nationally syndicated radio show early Thursday, the morning after President Bush's speech on Iraq.  ''I'm not as well known as some of the other candidates who'll be running, but a year from now, we'll still be talking about the first caucuses and primaries,'' he said. ''Twelve months is more than a lifetime in politics.''  Senator Dodd, 62, said he had finally decided that he wanted to get ''out of the bleachers and on the arena floor and make my case.''  Mr. Dodd, in his fifth term, said he planned to have a rally with Connecticut supporters this week, after traveling to Iowa and South Carolina to gather early support.  Mr. Imus needled Mr. Dodd by saying that he had been particularly impressed with Mr. Obama.  Mr. Dodd responded with a mix of chuckles and indignation: ''Wait a minute. I come on the program, I blow everyone else off. I announce here -- at least leave the door open a little bit for me.''  The state's other senator, Joseph I. Lieberman, ran for vice president in 2000 and president in 2004.",

            "fulltext": "The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying rules, overcoming bipartisan reluctance to ban many of the favors that lobbyists do for lawmakers and to illuminate the shadowy legislative practice of earmarking money for special projects.  The Senate's action makes the start of the 110th Congress a watershed moment in the history of K Street and Capitol Hill. Interpreting the results of the Nov. 7 election as a reaction to corruption scandals when Congress was under Republican control, the Senate has joined the House in adopting broad new rules that go beyond the proposals Republicans introduced last year, the ones that Democrats campaigned on, or the extensive changes House Democrats recently passed.  The measure passed around 9 p.m. by a vote of 96 to 2. Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, both Republicans, were the only members to vote against the bill.  On Wednesday, Senate Republicans nearly derailed the bill in a dispute over when the Democrats would agree to vote on a Republican proposal, a version of the line-item veto. At a news conference Thursday, a half-dozen Democratic senators competed to belittle the Republicans' line-item veto as ''an excuse,'' ''a ploy,'' ''a subterfuge,'' a ''rabbit out of a hat'' and ''a grand act of ethics hypocrisy.''  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the leader of the new Democratic majority, threatened to postpone any action on ethics until the next election and publicly blame the Republicans if they did not allow a vote Thursday.  But by Thursday evening, Mr. Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had resolved the impasse. They agreed to hold a vote on the line-item veto as part of a minimum-wage debate next week.  ''This legislation has been extremely difficult to deal with,'' Mr. Reid said Thursday night. ''It is difficult because it deals with our lives.''  ''In the short-term, the reforms in this bill may take some getting used to,'' he added, ''but in the long term, we'll be thankful we took these steps.''  Like the new House rules, the Senate bill bars members from accepting gifts, meals or trips from lobbyists or the organizations that employ them. It ends the use by senators of borrowed corporate jets at discount rates.  Also like the House rules, the Senate measure requires disclosure of the sponsors, the purpose and the cost of the pet projects, or earmarks, that lawmakers have been able to tuck anonymously into complicated spending bills.  Unlike the House, the bill would also explicitly prohibit earmarks that would benefit the immediate family of the senator who sponsored it. Many of those changes revise internal Senate rules and do not require House or presidential approval.  Senate Democrats also incorporated into the bill a provision that, if signed into law, would require for the first time that lobbyists disclose the most valuable favors they do for lawmakers: holding campaign fund-raisers, soliciting campaign contributions and bundling checks from clients and friends.  Of all the bill's provisions, it was the disclosure requirements for bundled checks that met the stiffest resistance behind the scenes in the Democratic caucus because of the potential to make it harder for incumbent lawmakers to tap K Street lobbyists as surrogate fund-raisers, aides involved in negotiations over the bill said, speaking anonymously because the talks were confidential.  Addressing another loophole in campaign finance laws, the Senate bill would also bar lobbyists or their employers from giving parties to honor lawmakers at party conventions. House Democrats say they plan to take up the subject of lobbying rules on their side of the Capitol in the next several weeks.  The party leaders began by teaming up to introduce a much weaker bipartisan bill, and lawmakers in both parties acknowledged behind-the-scenes resistance to strengthening it. But many found amendments to strengthen the bill -- a number of them offered by Senators Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin and Barack Obama of Illinois, both Democrats -- politically difficult to oppose.  Fred Wertheimer, president of the ethics group Democracy 21, said, ''These are always difficult battles, but when you get them on the floor you get votes of 96 to 2.''  The bill became a pivotal test for Mr. Reid in his new role trying to manage the Senate. He is a frequent target of Republican accusations of fraternizing with influence-peddlers. Several members of his immediate family have worked as lobbyists, although he says that none have lobbied his office, and he is among the biggest recipients of the discounted use of corporate jets for travel.  Mr. Reid promised vigorous reform as his first act as majority leader. He offered an amendment to bar lawmakers from accepting the discounted use of corporate jets.  But when a Republican senator offered an amendment to match the House's earmark disclosure rules, Mr. Reid miscounted the votes he had on his side when he tried and failed to table the measure. Mr. Reid first argued against moving too fast to match the House Democrats' new rules and then embraced the same idea with token modifications.  Mr. Coburn, one of the two ''no'' votes, said he had been troubled by a lack of openness in the negotiations over the contents of the bill. Senators Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat who is recovering from health problems, and Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, were absent and did not vote.",

The Republican candidate, Maureen O'Connell, recently wrote a letter to Governor Spitzer urging him to support a Nassau County Democrat, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, below, for state comptroller.  ''As the taxpayers' advocate, the state comptroller must possess independence and integrity,'' Ms. O'Connell wrote in the letter, which was also published in a local newspaper. ''Assemblyman DiNapoli personifies these traits and, through his lifetime of public service, he has earned the public's trust.''  Mr. DiNapoli is one of at least 18 people -- lawmakers, current or former officials and businessmen -- seeking to replace the former comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned after pleading guilty to a felony for using a state worker to chauffeur his wife.  Ms. O'Connell, who is running in a district where registered Democrats now outnumber registered Republicans, said in an interview that she had not yet run into any Republicans who were miffed that she would back a Democrat for the high-profile office.  Since Democrats will have the upper hand in choosing the next comptroller, few Republicans expressed any interest in the race -- with one exception being Andrew S. Eristoff, a commissioner of tax and finance in the Pataki administration.  ''The reason I wrote the letter is because I've known Tom DiNapoli for a long time,'' Ms. O'Connell, herself a former assemblywoman from the area, said in an interview.

By the numbers, Republicans were already at a disadvantage. Twenty-one Republican seats will be open, compared with 12 Democratic seats. And not having a Republican incumbent on the ballot in a competitive state like Colorado complicates matters for Republicans.  Already, campaign politics is infusing substantive debates on Capitol Hill. Many of the incumbent Republican senators who have stepped forward to oppose President Bush's Iraq policy face re-election. (Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon started the trend late last year, followed by others, including Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota last week.) Even before Mr. Allard's announcement, Colorado was emerging as a gateway to the West for Democrats, who have won the governor's office, two House districts and a Senate seat in the last four years. Those successes helped seal the Democratic Party's decision to hold its 2008 national convention in Denver. And now, the state will be host to one of the most closely watched Senate races in the nation, too.  JEFF ZELENY  POLITICAL ACTION",

            "fulltext": "The honeymoon may be coming to an end. Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican Senate majority leader, accused Gov. Eliot Spitzer on Wednesday of being hypocritical for championing campaign finance reform while headlining a $25,000-a-couple fund-raiser later this week for the state Democratic Party.  Mr. Spitzer has been campaigning for Craig M. Johnson, the Nassau County Democrat running for the Senate seat that opened when the governor tapped Senator Michael A. L. Balboni, a Republican, to serve in his administration. Mr. Bruno and his shrinking Republican majority in the State Senate have made keeping the seat a priority.  ''I wouldn't be talking campaign finance reform on one hand, and then on the other hand, doing 25,000 price of admission to funnel money -- funnel money, launder money -- into a Senate contest,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''I think it's inappropriate, I think it's inequitable, I think it's unfair, and I think it's time to step up and tell it like it is.''  Shortly after he was elected, Mr. Spitzer unilaterally placed a $10,000 limit on campaign contributions that he would accept, and asked the Legislature to pass a law significantly lowering the limits on donations. But his aides said he would abide by the higher limits that exist under the current law when raising money for other entities -- in this case, the state Democratic Party. The money could end up being used on the Senate race.  An e-mailed invitation to the fund-raiser, which will be held Thursday evening on the Upper East Side, promises ''an intimate evening with New York State Governor Eliot Spitzer'' and lists a minimum ticket price of $25,000 per couple.  Up to now, Mr. Bruno has gone out of his way to praise Mr. Spitzer publicly. But in campaigning for Mr. Johnson, Mr. Spitzer has shown he is willing to break the so-called nonaggression pact that has sometimes existed in Albany between governors and lawmakers of the opposing party whose support they need to govern.  Christine Anderson, Mr. Spitzer's press secretary, said he was glad to campaign for Mr. Johnson. ''The governor is asking people in the district to support reform, and he is proud of that,'' she said.  Mr. Bruno's decision to criticize the popular new governor's ethics was something of a gamble, given his announcement late last year that the F.B.I. has been looking into his business dealings. Senate Republicans have long shifted money between campaign accounts to protect incumbents.  The campaign of the Republican candidate in Nassau County, Maureen O'Connell, is being supported indirectly by Mr. Balboni, the new member of the Spitzer administration she hopes to succeed. Campaign filings show that he sent $110,000 from his campaign account to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee on Dec. 27. On Jan. 8 the committee sent Ms. O'Connell $330,000, the vast majority of what she has raised so far.  Mr. Johnson has raised over $125,000, and taken in $92,500 more in personal and family loans, campaign finance filings show.",

After more than five hours of haggling about making public the votes for speaker, Representative Jim Pitts withdrew.  Slightly more than 30 minutes later, Mr. Craddick was elected, 121 to 27, to close the first floor effort to defeat an incumbent speaker since 1959.  Mr. Pitts, of Waxahachie, whom Mr. Craddick appointed chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has been in the House since 1992. He has at times disagreed with Mr. Craddick's leadership, which is often compared with Mr. DeLay's.  ''It's time to heal,'' Mr. Pitts said in a speech before the House after his withdrawal and before he voted for Mr. Craddick. ''It's time to go on with Texas's business.''  The victory of Mr. Craddick, of Midland, who has been in the Legislature since 1968, ended a fight that has dominated the political landscape here for three weeks. The House elects a speaker on the first day of each regular session every two years.  The speaker's duties include overseeing floor debates, appointing members to standing committees and referring measures to committees.  Bills on immigration and campaign finance overhaul have been filed for the session, which lasts until May 28.  Mr. Craddick, who has been speaker since January 2003, when he became the first Republican to hold the post in 130 years, was investigated along with Mr. DeLay over fund-raising in the 2002 legislative races but was not indicted by a grand jury in Travis County.  Mr. DeLay was indicted in September 2005 on charges of violating the campaign finance law. He worked closely with Mr. Craddick in redrawing district maps in 2003 that benefited Republicans.  In his acceptance speech, Mr. Craddick promised to work with Republicans and Democrats.  ''I want to assure each and every one of you today,'' Mr. Craddick said, ''that I believe my primary responsibility as your elected speaker is to fulfill your elected purpose, not mine.''  Gov. Rick Perry, also a Republican, expressed optimism for the session, mentioning a desire to improve health care, education and border security.  ''The success of this session will not be judged by what has happened over the last few hours,'' Mr. Perry said, ''but by what we do in the end.''",

            "fulltext": "The strange race to become the next comptroller of New York State began in earnest on Friday as at least 18 candidates took the first step toward being considered by submitting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to the State Legislature.  The aspirants include six Democratic state lawmakers, eight current and former government officials and four businessmen. Prominent newcomers who expressed interest in the job included Martha E. Stark, the New York City finance commissioner; James L. Larocca, who served in the Cuomo and Carey cabinets; and Alphonse Fletcher Jr., a money manager and philanthropist.  The entire Legislature will select the new state comptroller, but the real power to make the choice rests with the Assembly Democrats, its largest voting bloc. Many politicians here said they believed that the state lawmakers on the list have the inside track for the job.  The popularly elected comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, won with a comfortable majority in November, only to resign his four-year term in December after pleading guilty to a felony for using a state worker as a driver and aide for his wife.  It is unclear if there are more than 18 candidates because the Assembly Democrats, who had pledged to conduct an open and public selection process, declined to say who had applied for the job by the time the deadline of Friday at noon had passed. They said that they would not release a list of candidates until Monday, when the candidates must submit financial disclosure forms. The Republican-led Senate provided its list of candidates, which officials said they thought was complete but could not say for sure.  Aides to the new governor, Eliot Spitzer, made it clear this month that they would prefer an independent candidate with fiscal experience from outside government. But after the Spitzer administration had trouble encouraging candidates to apply, the governor said that he would be open to a candidate from the Assembly.  Governor Spitzer negotiated a selection process with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, that calls for the candidates to be interviewed by the Legislature's joint fiscal committees, and then screened by a panel of three former New York State and New York City comptrollers. The panel will then whittle down the list to no more than five candidates, and the members of the Legislature will pick one from that pool.  Several Democrats and Republicans who saw the preliminary list of people interested in the job said that the qualifications of the candidates from outside the Legislature appeared to be so strong that it was unlikely that more than two, or maybe three, lawmakers would make the final list of five candidates -- which would shift the political calculus, depending on who makes the final cut.  The decision will probably rest with Mr. Silver, who has influence over the 108 Assembly Democrats, or a majority of the Legislature, which currently has 211 members. He is expected to take the governor's views into consideration, and a number of other groups will most likely weigh in, from caucuses within the Assembly to party leaders outside the Assembly.  Five assemblymen are seeking the post -- Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester, Thomas P. DiNapoli of Nassau County, Alexander B. Grannis of Manhattan, Joseph D. Morelle of the Rochester area, and Felix Ortiz of Brooklyn -- along with one state senator, Martin Connor of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Mr. DiNapoli is well liked by many colleagues, and could emerge as a consensus candidate, but is generally better known for his environmental work here than for his work on fiscal issues. Mr. Brodsky has been lining up votes and stressing the investigations he conducted into state authorities, but some of his colleagues view him as acerbic. Mr. Ortiz has the support of Hispanic groups.  The comptroller oversees the state's $145.7 billion pension fund, audits state agencies and local governments, and monitors state and local budgets.  Perhaps because of calls that the state's top fiscal office should not be given to a political appointee, several of the assemblymen vying for the post are taking steps to play down their political ties: Mr. Morelle quit his job as the chairman of the Monroe County Democratic Party, and Mr. DiNapoli stepped down from his position on the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee.  But more outsiders are seeking the job than lawmakers. They include William J. Mulrow, an investment banker who ran for comptroller in 2002 and who is close to Mr. Spitzer. But his bid could face difficulty because he is a member of one of the groups bidding for the state's valuable horseracing franchise.  And several state and local finance officials have expressed interest as well, including Howard S. Weitzman, the Nassau County comptroller; Andrew A. SanFilippo, the Buffalo comptroller; David Hancox, the director of state audits at the state comptroller's office; Philip LaTessa, the Syracuse auditor; Andrew S. Eristoff, who was the tax and finance commissioner in the Pataki administration, and Robert S. Hoffman, a former auditor in the state tax department.  So many people applied that the public hearing that is scheduled for Tuesday, where candidates will be invited to make 15-minute statements and take questions, may take more than one day. It could be crowded: since the hearing will be held by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, more than 60 lawmakers could conceivably be sitting on the da\u00efs and asking questions.  Candidates for comptroller who serve on those committees will not be allowed to question the other candidates, Assembly officials said.",

Warner of Virginia is drafting a proposal on Iraq policy with two Senate centrists in an effort to provide an outlet for lawmakers uneasy with President Bush's troop buildup but unwilling to back a toughly worded resolution opposing the new strategy.  Aides said Friday that Mr. Warner, a Republican who just stepped down as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was working with Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, to draw up a Senate resolution they will unveil Monday as an alternative to another bipartisan plan that flatly opposes troop increases in Iraq.  That measure, by Senators Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Carl Levin of Michigan, both Democrats, is scheduled to be considered by the Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. But the emergence of a proposal embraced by Mr. Warner, an influential Republican leader on military issues, and other proposals circulating in the Senate showed there was no consensus yet.  The flurry of Iraq resolutions, coming from the political left, right and middle, raised the prospect of muddling the outcome of what Democratic leaders had hoped to keep a simple yes-or-no vote on Mr. Bush's plan. Now, some lawmakers could vote for multiple resolutions if they reached the Senate floor.  ''Either you support an escalation of American forces in Iraq or you don't,'' Mr. Hagel said Friday. ''You can try and dance on the pinhead of technicality and wordsmithing all you want, but it's going to come down to that.''  The undercurrent of the 2008 presidential campaign is also pulling on the debate over the symbolic vote on Iraq. Democrats had originally planned to offer a single nonbinding resolution, but now at least four senators with presidential aspirations have put their own names on Iraq proposals.  In short order this week, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut introduced a plan to cap troop levels in Iraq; Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York offered a similar proposal; and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois said he would present legislation as early as next week. All stopped shy of a proposal offered by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would block spending for any troop increase, an idea favored by the staunchest opponents of the war.  With votes in the House and Senate still to come, Democratic Congressional leaders jousted with the White House on Friday over Mr. Bush's plan to add more than 20,000 troops to try to quiet violence in Iraq.  In an interview on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC, Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Bush of moving quickly to put the added troops in place because he knew Congress would not limit spending for military personnel in the field.  ''Democrats will never cut off funding for our troops when they are in harm's way,'' Ms. Pelosi said, ''but we will hold the president accountable. He has to answer for his war. He has dug a hole so deep he can't even see the light on this. It's a tragedy. It's a stark blunder.''  That drew a sharp response from the White House, where Dana Perino, a spokeswoman, called Ms. Pelosi's comments ''poisonous'' and said Democrats had embarked on ''sound bite war.''  ''Speaker Pelosi was arguing in essence that the president is putting young men and women in harm's way for tactical political reasons,'' Ms. Perino said. ''And she's questioning his motivations, rather than questioning his policies.''  Senators Warner, Collins and Nelson, in a move reminiscent of the ''Gang of 14'' meetings that helped avert a showdown over judicial filibusters in 2005, began meeting this week after they saw the language of the initial bipartisan resolution. Some lawmakers who had expressed resistance to the troop increase said the wording was too partisan and went far beyond the issue of Iraq to discuss the entire Middle East, North Korea and Afghanistan.  Aides to the three senators declined to elaborate on the proposal, but all three have expressed skepticism about the administration's plan to send more troops to Iraq. In an interview last week, Mr. Warner said Congress should move deliberately, but swiftly.  ''Each of us are pained by the casualties that we are taking,'' Mr. Warner said. ''We cannot dither around on it.''  Mr. Biden and his allies have some advantages in making their resolution the center of the debate because he is now chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and can move his resolution quickly through that panel. And the Democratic leadership, which determines the floor schedule, has indicated its support for the concept as well.  ''The president's plan will receive an up-or-down vote in both chambers of Congress,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Friday in a speech at the National Press Club. ''With that vote, our hope, really our prayer, is that the president will finally listen: listen to the generals, listen to the Iraq Study Group, listen to the American people and listen to a bipartisan Congress.''

Seeing your child picked on -- physically or emotionally -- is a hard one. You ache to spare them what you went through, though I, for one, could not. In one case, my oldest was in third grade and a kid was repeatedly jamming his head against the school bus window. I told Ben I'd talk to the principal, but he begged me not to. I told him he ought to just smack the kid, but he would not; he feared getting in trouble. I told him I thought it was worth the punishment; he did not.  My daughter was a few years older when she was frozen out by a couple of girls. I counseled her to ignore them as aggressively as they were ignoring her -- but she didn't want my advice, and the more I talked to her, the angrier she got. I hated seeing her hang around waiting for those girls to instant-message back.  Maybe if the situations had been more extreme I'd have intervened, but I felt that even at a young age the kids had the right to work these problems through themselves, and I kept my distance.  Still, it hurt to watch. What I could do was remind them how much they were loved; explain that I'd gone through the same thing; and tell them my story of being ostracized, which, as it turns out, was recently resolved -- 40 years later.  When I was in junior high I was part of a group of four boys. We were all good students and very close. We'd spend as much time together as we could in and out of school. I'd often go over to their houses. We formed a club, were forever making grand plans.  Then, during eighth grade, without a harsh word and with no warning, they froze me out. They stopped calling, ignored me at school. If I committed some gaffe -- like wearing white sports socks with dark shoes -- they'd find it hilarious. If I phoned, they weren't home. When I spoke to them at school, they'd shrug, saying nothing.  It was painful and humiliating, too; other kids knew.  I wished for it to stop, but it didn't. After being good buddies of mine since fifth grade, they didn't talk to me again.  In the months that followed, I spent lots of time alone. My mother noticed -- she'd watch me sulk around and ask why I never called my friends anymore. I said nothing. How could she understand? How do you make kids like you who don't want to? No one has that power, certainly not a parent.  While I was sure it wasn't my fault, can you ever be sure?  It changed me. I became more guarded, more of an outsider, more aware that people weren't what they seemed to be. Now, as an adult, I know this was an important part of growing up. I was learning to view the world with a harder eye. In eighth grade, it just felt lonely.  This wasn't some epic tragedy. In time, I made new friends, the pain receded, and after a while I gave it little thought, until years later I told my own kids the story as a balm.  About five years ago, one of the three boys -- now a middle-aged academic -- sent an e-mail message to The New York Times, saying he'd seen my byline and, if I was the same person, he'd like to get in touch to apologize for something bad he'd done when we were kids. The editor who forwarded the note said it sounded so juicy, I had to call him. But I didn't. By then it seemed like small potatoes, and I really didn't feel a need for an apology.  A few years later I learned from a mutual acquaintance that he had died from health problems and wondered: Did he know he was dying? Is that why he'd written? About the same time, a second ''boy'' in the group -- by then a 52-year-old physician -- died in a traffic accident. In my mind they were still in junior high, and now two were dead.  Then, a few weeks ago, I got an e-mail message from the last ''boy.'' He'd tracked me down online. Michael Bernstein wrote that he was an educator in Jewish studies in Australia. He said that he'd read my recent column about my mother's death and wanted to extend his condolences.  ''More important, however, although it is belated, I want to apologize for my appalling behavior as a teenager in deliberately ostracizing you and, for no sensible reason, severing our childhood friendship,'' he wrote. ''Although it is easy to expedite the excuse of youthful folly, I would be lying if I said that I didn't know my behavior was wrong. The tragic truth is I just didn't care. I remember in high school making a lame attempt at rectification by treating you with a bit more kindness, but I never had the courage to say that I was sorry. I hope you can accept that apology now, even if it is 40 years overdue.''  I wrote back telling him how stunned I had been to hear from him, and how pleased, too, and that our falling-out had long ago stopped mattering to me. I filled him in on what I knew about the other two -- he hadn't heard from them in years -- and wrote that I'd told my own children our story and might like to include it in a parenting column.  He responded graciously: ''I am happy for you to use our story instructively in one of your pieces, and I have no objection to you using my name.''  However, he went on to write that there was one piece of unfinished business. ''I noted that you did not really accept my apology,'' he wrote. ''When it comes to apologies, it is the perpetrator's wish to rectify things that needs to be respected rather than the sentiments of the victim. Although you might feel it was a long time and you don't need to be apologized to, obviously I feel otherwise or I would not have contacted you. From a kabbalistic perspective, it is the formal acceptance of the apology that breaks any negativity in the cycle of development. So I hope you will indulge me by accepting my apology even though you think it is a long time ago and small potatoes.''  I wrote back that, of course, I did.  I told my children the new ending to the story. They seemed interested; at least I didn't catch them rolling their eyes the way they do at a lot of Dad's classics. But the story has a fresh ending that I should have known from my own transgressions. It's not just something in the Bible: Over time, the pain may weigh more on the bully than the bullied.

            "fulltext": "Bosch has found the radiation victim's Toyota in an alley not far from the overlook, and inside it, many objects asociated with Stanley Kent's murder, particularly the cesium. In the process, however, Bosch, too, has been exposed to the radiation.  The car jerked forward as Walling pulled out of the alley and into southbound traffic on Cahuenga.  ''I'm taking you back to Queen of Angels so Dr. Gardner can have a look at you,'' she said. ''Just hang in there for me, Bosch.''  He knew that the last-name endearments were probably about to come to an end. He pointed toward the left-turn lane that led onto Barham Boulevard.  ''Never mind the hospital,'' he said. ''Take me back to the Kent house.''  ''What?''  ''I'll get checked out later. Go to the Kent house. Here's the turn.''  She slipped into the left-turn lane.  ''What are you telling me, that that little fainting spell back there was -- ''  ''I had to get you away from the crime scene and away from Brenner so I could check this out and talk to you.''  ''Check what out? Talk about what? Do you realize what you just did? I thought I was saving your life. Now Brenner or one of those other guys will take the credit for the recovery. Thanks a lot. That was my crime scene.''  He opened his jacket and pulled out the rolled and folded-over yoga poster.  ''Don't worry about it,'' he said. ''You can get the credit for the arrests. You just might not want it.''  He opened the poster, letting the top half flop over his knees. He was interested in only the bottom half.  ''Dhanurasana,'' he said.  Walling glanced over at him and then down at the poster.  ''Would you start telling me what's going on?''  ''Alice Kent practices yoga. I saw the mats in the workout room at the house.''  ''I saw them, too. So what?''  ''Did you see the sun discoloration on the wall where a picture or a calendar or maybe a poster had been taken down?''  ''Yes, I saw it.''  Bosch held up the poster.  ''I'm betting that we go in there and this will be a perfect fit. This is a poster Gonzalves found with the cesium.''  ''And what will that mean -- if it's a perfect fit?''  ''It will mean Alice Kent conspired to kill her husband, and if it hadn't been for Digiberto Gonzalves, it would have been a perfect crime.''  Walling shook her head dismissively.  ''Come on, Harry. Are you saying she conspired with international terrorists to kill her husband in exchange for the cesium? I can't believe I am even doing this. I need to get back to the crime scene.''  She started checking her mirrors, getting ready to make a U-turn. They were going up Lake Hollywood Drive now and would be at the house in two minutes.  ''No, keep going. We're almost there. Alice Kent conspired with someone, but it wasn't a terrorist. The cesium being dumped in the trash proves that. You said it yourself, there is no way that Moby and Elfayed would steal this stuff to just dump it. So what does that tell you? This wasn't a heist. It actually was a murder. The cesium was just a red herring. Moby and Elfayed? They were part of the misdirection. And this poster will help prove it.''  ''How?''  ''Dhanurasana, the rocking bow.''  He held the poster up so she could glance at the yoga pose depicted in the bottom corner. It showed a woman with her arms behind her back, holding her ankles and creating a bow with the front of her body. She looked as if she were hogtied.  Walling glanced back at the curving road and then took another long look at the poster and the pose.  ''We go into the house and see if this fits that space on the wall,'' Bosch said. ''If it fits, that means she and the killer took it off the wall because they didn't want to risk that we might see it and connect it with what happened to her.''  ''It's a stretch, Harry. A huge one.''  ''Not when you put it in context.''  ''Which you, of course, can do.''  ''As soon as we get to the house.''  ''Hope you still have a key.''  ''You bet I do.''  Walling turned onto Arrowhead Drive and punched the accelerator. But after a block she took her foot off, slowed down and shook her head again.  ''This is ridiculous. She gave us the name Moby. There is no way she could have known he was in this country. And then up on the overlook, your own witness said that the shooter called out to Allah as he pulled the trigger. How can -- ''  ''Let's try the poster on the wall. If it fits, I'll lay the whole thing out for you. I promise. If it doesn't fit, then I will quit bothering you with it.''  She relented and drove the remaining block to the Kent house without another word. There was no longer a bureau car sitting out front. Bosch guessed that it was all hands on deck at the cesium-recovery scene.  ''Thank God I don't have to deal with Maxwell again,'' he said.  Walling didn't even smile.  Bosch got out with the poster and his file containing the crime-scene photos. He used Stanley Kent's keys to open the front door, and they proceeded to the workout room. They took positions on either side of the rectangular discoloration, and Bosch unrolled the poster. They each took a side and held the top corners of the poster to the top corners of the mark. Bosch put his other hand on the center of the poster and flattened it against the wall. The poster was a perfect fit.  Rachel immediately let go of her side and headed out of the room.  ''I'll be in the living room. I can't wait to hear you put this together.''  Bosch rolled the poster up and followed. Walling took a seat in the same chair Bosch put Maxwell in a few hours earlier. He remained standing in front of her.  ''The fear was that the poster could be a tip-off,'' he said. ''Some smart agent or detective would see the rocking-bow pose and start thinking, This woman does yoga, maybe she could handle being hogtied like that. Maybe it was her idea, maybe she did it to help sell the misdirection. So they couldn't take the chance. The poster had to go. It went into the Dumpster with the cesium, the gun and everything else they used. If you get your people out there to check that line of Dumpsters, you'll find the rest -- the Coke-bottle silencer, the ski mask, the gloves, the first set of snap ties, every -- ''  ''The first set of snap ties?''  ''That's right. I'll get to that.''  Walling looked unimpressed.  ''You better get to a lot of it. Because there are big gaps in this thing, man. What about the name Moby? What about the citing of Allah by the shooter? What -- ''  Bosch held up a hand.  ''Just hold on,'' he said. ''I need some water. My throat is raw from all of this talking.''  He went into the kitchen, remembering that he saw bottles of chilled water in the refrigerator while searching the kitchen earlier.  ''You want anything?'' he called out.  ''No,'' she called back. ''It's not our house, remember?''  He opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle of water and drank half of it while standing in front of the open door. He then went back out to the living room, where Rachel was waiting for the story. Once again, he remained standing.  ''O.K., when was it that you captured the terrorist known as Moby on video at the port?''  ''What does -- ''  ''Please, just answer the question.''  ''Aug. 12.''  ''O.K., Aug. 12. Then what, some sort of alert went out through the bureau and Homeland Security?''  She nodded.  ''Not for a while, though,'' she said. ''It took almost a month of video analysis to confirm it was Nassar and Elfayed. I wrote the bulletin. It went out Sept. 9 as a confirmed domestic sighting.''  ''Out of curiosity, why didn't you go public with it?''  ''Because we have -- actually, I can't tell you.''  ''You just did. You must have someone or someplace where you think these two might show up under surveillance. If you go public, they might just go underground and never show up again.''  ''Can we go back to your story, please?''  ''Fine. So the bulletin went out Sept. 9. That was the day the plan to kill Stanley Kent began.''  Walling folded her arms across her chest and just stared at him. Bosch thought that maybe she was beginning to see where he was going with the story, and she didn't like it.  ''It works best if you start from the end and go backward,'' Bosch said. ''She gave you the name Moby. How could she have gotten that name?''  ''She overheard one of them calling the other one that name.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''No, she told you she overheard it. But if she was lying, how would she know the name to lie about it? Just coincidence that she gives the nickname of a guy who was just discovered in the country -- in L.A. County, no less? I don't think so, Rachel, and neither do you.''  ''O.K., so you're saying that somebody in the bureau or another agency that received the F.B.I. bulletin gave her the name.''  ''That's right. He gave her the name so she could come out with it while being questioned by the F.B.I.'s master interrogator. That one name would then send this whole thing down the wrong road with the F.B.I. and everybody else chasing after terrorists who had nothing to do with it.''  ''He?''  ''I'm getting to that now. You are right, anybody who got a look at that bulletin would have been able to give her that name. My guess is that would be a lot of people. A lot of people just in L.A. alone. So how would we narrow it down to one?''  ''You tell me.''  Bosch opened the bottle and drank the rest of the water. He held the empty bottle in his hand as he continued.  ''You narrow it down by continuing to go backward. Where would Alice Kent's life have intersected with one of those people in the agencies who knew about Moby?''  ''That could be anywhere with those kind of parameters. It could've happened when she was buying fertilizer for her roses.''  ''Then narrow the parameters. Where would she have intersected with someone who knew about Moby but also knew that her husband had access to the sort of radioactive materials Moby might be interested in?''  She shook her head in a disdainful way.  ''Nowhere. It would take a monumental coincidence to -- ''  She stopped when it came to her. There was enlightenment and shock as she fully understood where Bosch was going.  ''My partner and I visited the Kents to warn them a year ago. I guess what you're saying is that that makes me a suspect.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''I said 'he,' remember? You didn't come here alone.''  Her eyes fired when she registered the implication.  ''That's ridiculous. There's no way. I can't believe you would. . . . ''  She didn't finish, as her mind snagged on something, some memory or tell that undermined her trust and loyalty to her partner.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing.''  ''What?''  ''Look,'' she insisted, ''take my advice and tell no one this theory of yours. You're lucky you told me first. Because this makes you sound like some kind of crackpot with a vendetta. You have no evidence, no motive, no incriminating statements, nothing. You just have this thing you've spun out of . . . out of a yoga poster.''  ''There is no other explanation that fits with the facts. And I'm talking about the facts of the case. Not the fact that the bureau and Homeland Security and the rest of the federal government would love this to be a terrorism event so they can justify their existence and deflect criticism from other failings. Contrary to what you want to think, there is evidence and there are incriminating statements. If we put Alice Kent on a lie detector, you'll find out that everything she told me, you and the master interrogator downtown is a lie.''  Walling leaned forward and looked down at the floor.  ''That master interrogator you love deriding happened to be me.''  Bosch's mouth dropped open for a moment before he spoke.  ''Oh . . . well . . . then, sorry . . . but it doesn't matter. The point is, she is a master liar. She lied about everything, and now that we know the story, it will be easy to smoke her out.''  Walling got up from her seat and walked over to the front picture window. The vertical blinds were closed, but she split them with a finger and stared out into the street. Bosch could see her working the story over, grinding it down.  ''What about the witness?'' she asked without turning around. ''He heard the shooter yell, 'Allah.' Are you saying he's part of this?''  Now Bosch sat down and gently tried to clear his throat. It was burning and getting difficult to talk.  ''No, on that I think it's just a lesson in hearing what you want to hear. I plead guilty to not being much of a master interrogator myself. The kid told me that he heard the shooter yell it as he pulled the trigger. He said he wasn't sure but that it sounded like 'Allah,' and that, of course, worked with what I was thinking at the time.''  Walling came away from the window and sat down across from him. She folded her arms again. Bosch continued.  ''But how would he know it was the shooter and not the victim who yelled? He was more than 50 yards away. It was dark. How would he know that it wasn't Stanley Kent yelling out his last word before execution? The name of the woman he loved because he was about to die not even knowing that she'd betrayed him in the worst way.''  ''Alice.''  ''Exactly.''  Walling relaxed her arms and leaned forward. As body language went, it was a good sign. It told Bosch he was pushing through.  ''You said 'the first set of snap ties' before,'' she said. ''What were you talking about?''  Bosch nodded and handed her the file containing the crime-scene photos. He had saved the best for last.  ''Look at the photos,'' he said. ''What do you see?''  She opened the file and started looking at them. They depicted the master bedroom in the Kent house from all angles.  ''It's the master bedroom,'' she said. ''What am I missing?''  ''Exactly.''  ''What?''  ''It's what you don't see. There are no clothes in the shot. She told us they told her to take off her clothes and get on the bed. What are we supposed to believe, that they let her put the clothes away before they hogtied her? They let her put them in the hamper? Look at the last shot. It's the e-mail photo Stanley Kent got.''  Walling looked through the file until she found the printout of the photo. She stared intently at it. He saw recognition break in her eyes.  ''Now what do you see?''  ''The robe,'' she said excitedly. ''When we let her get dressed, she went to the closet to get her robe. There was no robe on that lounge chair!''  Bosch nodded, and they started trading the story back and forth.  ''What does that tell us?'' he asked. ''That these considerate terrorists hung the robe up in the closet for her after taking the photo?''  ''Or that maybe Mrs. Kent was tied up twice and the robe was moved in between?''  ''And look again at the picture. The clock on the bedside table is unplugged.''  ''Why?''  ''I don't know, but maybe they didn't want to worry about having any sort of time stamp on the photo. Maybe the first photo wasn't even taken yesterday. Maybe it came from a dry run two days ago or two weeks.''  Rachel nodded, and Bosch knew she was a believer.  ''She was tied up once for the photo and then once again for the rescue,'' she said.  ''Exactly. And that left her free to help carry out the plan on the overlook. She didn't kill her husband, but she was up there in the other car. And once Stanley was dead and the car was ditched and the cesium dumped, she and her partner came back home, and she was tied up all over again.''  ''She wasn't passed out when we got there,'' Walling said. ''That was an act and part of the plan. And her wetting the bed was a nice little touch to help sell it to us.''  There was no doubt now. Bosch had her. But then the shadow of concern and doubt moved across her face like a summer cloud.  ''What about motive?'' she asked. ''This is a federal agent we're talking about. To move on this we need everything, even motive. There can be nothing left open to chance.''  Bosch had been ready for the question.  ''You saw the motive. Alice Kent is a beautiful woman. Jack Brenner wanted her, and Stanley Kent was in the way of that.''  Walling's eyes widened in shock. Bosch pressed on with his case.  ''That's the motive, Rachel. You -- ''  ''But he -- ''  ''Let me just finish. It goes like this. You and your partner show up here that day last year to give the Kents the warning about his occupation. Some kind of vibe is exchanged between Alice and Jack. He gets interested, she gets interested. They meet on the sly for coffee or drinks or whatever. One thing leads to another. An affair begins, and it lasts, and then it lasts to the point that it's time to start thinking about doing something. Leaving the husband. Or getting rid of him because there's insurance and half a company at stake. That's enough motive right there, Rachel, and that's what this case is about. It's not about cesium or terrorism or anything else. It's sex and murder. That's all.''  She frowned and shook her head.  ''You don't know what you are talking about. Jack Brenner is married and has three children. That's why I wanted him as a partner. He's stable, boring and not interested. He wasn't -- ''  ''Every man is interested. It doesn't matter if they're married or how many kids they have.''  She spoke quietly.  ''Would you listen and let me finish now? You are wrong about Brenner. He never met Alice Kent before today. He wasn't my partner when I came here last year, and I never told you he was.''  Bosch was jolted by the news. He'd assumed that her current partner was her partner last year. He'd had Brenner's image locked and loaded in his mind as he had spun the story.  ''Then who was your partner?'' he asked.  ''I switched partners and hooked up with Jack after the start of the year. Basically, I was tired of my old partner coming on to me. I wanted to move on.''  ''Who was it, Rachel?''  She held his eyes for a long moment.  ''It was Cliff Maxwell.''

            "fulltext": "MANY things you live through as a kid are unpleasant, but you survive them, grow up, think you're done with all that, then experience that very emotion again as you watch your children go through the same misery.  Seeing your child picked on -- physically or emotionally -- is a hard one. You ache to spare them what you went through, though I, for one, could not. In one case, my oldest was in third grade and a kid was repeatedly jamming his head against the school bus window. I told Ben I'd talk to the principal, but he begged me not to. I told him he ought to just smack the kid, but he would not; he feared getting in trouble. I told him I thought it was worth the punishment; he did not.  My daughter was a few years older when she was frozen out by a couple of girls. I counseled her to ignore them as aggressively as they were ignoring her -- but she didn't want my advice, and the more I talked to her, the angrier she got. I hated seeing her hang around waiting for those girls to instant-message back.  Maybe if the situations had been more extreme I'd have intervened, but I felt that even at a young age the kids had the right to work these problems through themselves, and I kept my distance.  Still, it hurt to watch. What I could do was remind them how much they were loved; explain that I'd gone through the same thing; and tell them my story of being ostracized, which, as it turns out, was recently resolved -- 40 years later.  When I was in junior high I was part of a group of four boys. We were all good students and very close. We'd spend as much time together as we could in and out of school. I'd often go over to their houses. We formed a club, were forever making grand plans.  Then, during eighth grade, without a harsh word and with no warning, they froze me out. They stopped calling, ignored me at school. If I committed some gaffe -- like wearing white sports socks with dark shoes -- they'd find it hilarious. If I phoned, they weren't home. When I spoke to them at school, they'd shrug, saying nothing.  It was painful and humiliating, too; other kids knew.  I wished for it to stop, but it didn't. After being good buddies of mine since fifth grade, they didn't talk to me again.  In the months that followed, I spent lots of time alone. My mother noticed -- she'd watch me sulk around and ask why I never called my friends anymore. I said nothing. How could she understand? How do you make kids like you who don't want to? No one has that power, certainly not a parent.  While I was sure it wasn't my fault, can you ever be sure?  It changed me. I became more guarded, more of an outsider, more aware that people weren't what they seemed to be. Now, as an adult, I know this was an important part of growing up. I was learning to view the world with a harder eye. In eighth grade, it just felt lonely.  This wasn't some epic tragedy. In time, I made new friends, the pain receded, and after a while I gave it little thought, until years later I told my own kids the story as a balm.  About five years ago, one of the three boys -- now a middle-aged academic -- sent an e-mail message to The New York Times, saying he'd seen my byline and, if I was the same person, he'd like to get in touch to apologize for something bad he'd done when we were kids. The editor who forwarded the note said it sounded so juicy, I had to call him. But I didn't. By then it seemed like small potatoes, and I really didn't feel a need for an apology.  A few years later I learned from a mutual acquaintance that he had died from health problems and wondered: Did he know he was dying? Is that why he'd written? About the same time, a second ''boy'' in the group -- by then a 52-year-old physician -- died in a traffic accident. In my mind they were still in junior high, and now two were dead.  Then, a few weeks ago, I got an e-mail message from the last ''boy.'' He'd tracked me down online. Michael Bernstein wrote that he was an educator in Jewish studies in Australia. He said that he'd read my recent column about my mother's death and wanted to extend his condolences.  ''More important, however, although it is belated, I want to apologize for my appalling behavior as a teenager in deliberately ostracizing you and, for no sensible reason, severing our childhood friendship,'' he wrote. ''Although it is easy to expedite the excuse of youthful folly, I would be lying if I said that I didn't know my behavior was wrong. The tragic truth is I just didn't care. I remember in high school making a lame attempt at rectification by treating you with a bit more kindness, but I never had the courage to say that I was sorry. I hope you can accept that apology now, even if it is 40 years overdue.''  I wrote back telling him how stunned I had been to hear from him, and how pleased, too, and that our falling-out had long ago stopped mattering to me. I filled him in on what I knew about the other two -- he hadn't heard from them in years -- and wrote that I'd told my own children our story and might like to include it in a parenting column.  He responded graciously: ''I am happy for you to use our story instructively in one of your pieces, and I have no objection to you using my name.''  However, he went on to write that there was one piece of unfinished business. ''I noted that you did not really accept my apology,'' he wrote. ''When it comes to apologies, it is the perpetrator's wish to rectify things that needs to be respected rather than the sentiments of the victim. Although you might feel it was a long time and you don't need to be apologized to, obviously I feel otherwise or I would not have contacted you. From a kabbalistic perspective, it is the formal acceptance of the apology that breaks any negativity in the cycle of development. So I hope you will indulge me by accepting my apology even though you think it is a long time ago and small potatoes.''  I wrote back that, of course, I did.  I told my children the new ending to the story. They seemed interested; at least I didn't catch them rolling their eyes the way they do at a lot of Dad's classics. But the story has a fresh ending that I should have known from my own transgressions. It's not just something in the Bible: Over time, the pain may weigh more on the bully than the bullied.

            "fulltext": "Instead of going to the hospital to get checked out, Bosch, along with Walling, has gone back to the Kent house, where Bosch has convinced her that the terrorist angle was meant to distract, the crime being a classic one of sex and murder: Alice Kent had conspired with Walling's partner to kill Stanley Kent. Except the partner wasn't Brenner, as Bosch had been thinking.  Harry Bosch almost laughed but was too shocked to do anything except shake his head. Rachel Walling was telling him that Cliff Maxwell, the agent Bosch had tangled with twice in the last few hours, was Alice Kent's partner in murder.  ''I can't believe this,'' he finally said. ''Three hours ago I had the killer handcuffed on the floor right here!''  Walling looked mortified by the realization that the murder of Stanley Kent was an inside job and that the theft of the cesium was nothing more than a well-played misdirection.  ''You see the rest now?'' Bosch asked. ''You see how he would work it? Her husband's dead and he starts coming around out of sympathy and because he's on the case. They start dating, fall in love and nobody ever raises an eyebrow about it. They're still out there looking for Moby and Elfayed.''  ''And what if we ever catch those guys?'' Walling said, taking up the story. ''They could deny being a part of this thing until Osama bin Laden dies in a cave of old age, but who would believe them or care? There's nothing more ingenious than framing terrorists with a crime they didn't commit.''  ''A perfect crime. The only reason it blew up was because Digiberto Gonzalves checked that Dumpster. Without him we'd still be chasing Moby and Elfayed.''  ''So what do we do now, Bosch?''  Bosch shrugged but then answered anyway.  ''I say we set up a classic rat pit. Put them both in rooms, ring the bell and say the first one who talks gets the deal. I'd bet on Alice. She'll break and give him up, probably blame him for everything.''  ''Something tells me you're right. And the truth is, I don't think Maxwell was smart enough to pull this off. I worked with --''  Walling's cellphone started buzzing. She took it out of her pocket and looked at the screen.  ''It's Jack.''  ''Find out where Maxwell is.''  She answered the call and first answered a few questions about Bosch's status, telling Brenner that he was O.K. but was losing his voice because his throat hurt. Bosch got up for another bottle of water but listened from the kitchen. Walling casually steered the call toward Maxwell.  ''Hey, where's Cliff, by the way? I wanted to talk to him about that thing with Bosch in the hallway. I didn't like what he --''  She stopped and listened to the answer and Bosch saw her eyes immediately become alert. Something was wrong.  ''When was that?'' she asked.  She listened again and stood up.  ''Listen, Jack, I've got to go. I think Bosch is about to be discharged. I'll check in as soon as I'm clear here.''  She closed the phone and looked at Bosch.  ''What?''  ''Jack said there were too many agents at the recovery scene -- just about everybody came out from downtown and they were standing around waiting on the radiation team. So Maxwell volunteered to go pick up the witness at the Mark Twain. Nobody had gotten around to it because I'd pulled off the original pickup team.''  ''He went alone?''  ''That's what Jack said.''  ''How long ago?''  ''A half-hour.''  ''He's going to kill him.''  Bosch stood up and moved toward the door.  He drove this time. On the way to Hollywood he told Walling that Jesse Mitford had no phone in his room. The Mark Twain wasn't much when it came to full service. Instead, Bosch called the watch commander at Hollywood Division and asked him to send a patrol car to the hotel to check on the witness. He then called Information and was connected to the front desk at the Mark Twain.  ''Alvin, this is Detective Bosch. From this morning?''  ''Yeah, yeah. What's up with you, Detective?''  ''Has anyone come in asking for Charles Dickens?''  ''Mmm, nope.''  ''In the last 20 minutes have you buzzed in anybody who looked like a cop or who wasn't a tenant there?''  ''No, Detective. What's going on?''  ''Listen, I need you to go up to that room and tell Charles Dickens to get out of there and to then call me on my cell.''  ''I got nobody to watch the desk, Detective.''  ''It's an emergency, Alvin. I need to get him out of there. It will take you less than five minutes. Here, write this down. My number is 323-244-5631. You got it?''  ''I got it.''  ''O.K., go. And if anybody but me comes in there looking for him, say he checked out, took a refund and left. Go, Alvin, and thanks.''  Bosch closed the phone and looked over at Rachel. His face showed his lack of confidence in the deskman.  ''I think the guy's a meth-head.''  Bosch increased his speed and tried to concentrate on driving. They had just turned south on Cahuenga off Barham. Depending on traffic in Hollywood, he was thinking that they could get to the Mark Twain in another five minutes. This conclusion made him shake his head. With a half-hour lead, Maxwell should have reached the Mark Twain by now. He wondered if he had slipped in the back way and already gotten to Mitford.  ''Maxwell may have gone in through the back,'' he told Walling. ''I'm going to come in from the alley.''  ''You know,'' Walling said, ''maybe he's not going to hurt him. He'll pick him up and talk to him, judge for himself if he saw enough at the overlook that he'd be a threat.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''No way. Maxwell's got to know that once the cesium was found in the Dumpster that his plan was going down the toilet. He's got to take action against all threats. First the witness, then Alice Kent.''  ''Alice Kent? You think he'd make a move against her? This whole thing is because of her.''  ''Doesn't matter. Survival instincts take over now, and she's a threat. It goes with the territory. You cross the big line to be with her. You cross it again to save your --''  Bosch stopped as a sudden realization thudded in his chest. He cursed out loud and pinned the accelerator as they came out of the Cahuenga Pass. He cut across three lanes of Highland Avenue in front of the Hollywood Bowl and made a screeching U-turn in front of oncoming traffic. He punched it, and the car fishtailed wildly as he headed toward the southbound entrance to the Hollywood Freeway. Rachel grabbed the dashboard and a door handle to hold on.  ''Harry, what are you doing? This is the wrong way!''  He flicked on the siren and the blue lights that flashed in the front grill and back window of the car. He yelled his response to Walling.  ''Mitford is a misdirection. This is the right way. Who is the greater threat to Maxwell?''  ''Alice?''  ''You bet, and now's the best shot he has of getting her out of Tactical. Everybody's up in that alley with the cesium.''  The freeway was moving pretty well, and the siren helped open it up further. Depending on what kind of traffic Maxwell encountered, Bosch figured he could have already gotten to downtown.  Walling opened her phone and started calling numbers. She tried number after number, but no one was answering.  ''I can't get anybody,'' she said.  ''Where's T.I.U.?''  She didn't hesitate.  ''On Broadway. You know where the Million Dollar Theater is? Same building. Entrance on Third.''  Bosch opened his phone once more and called his partner. Ferras answered right away.  ''Ignacio, drop what you're doing and meet me at the Third Street entrance to the Million Dollar Theater building. You know where that is?''  ''What's going on? I hear the siren.''  ''Do you know where the Million Dollar Theater is?''  ''Yeah, I know where it is.''  ''Meet me there at the Third Street entrance. I'll explain when I get there.''  He closed the phone.  The next 10 minutes took 10 hours. Bosch moved in and out of traffic and finally reached the Broadway exit in downtown. He killed the siren as he made the turn and headed down the hill toward their destination. They were three blocks away.  The Million Dollar Theater was built in a time when the movie business showed itself off in magnificent theater palaces that lined Broadway in downtown. But it had been decades since a first-run film was projected on a screen there. Its ornate facade had been covered by a lighted marquee that for a time announced religious revivals instead of movies. Now it waited, unused, for renovation and redemption, while above it a once-grand office building was 12 stories of midgrade office space and residential lofts.  ''Good place for a secret unit to have a secret office,'' Bosch said as the building came into sight. ''Nobody would've guessed.''  Walling didn't respond. She was trying to make another call. She then slapped the phone closed in frustration.  ''I can't even get our secretary. She always takes early lunch so there will be somebody in the office when the agents take lunch.''  ''Where exactly is the squad and where would Alice Kent be in there?''  ''We have the whole seventh floor. There's a lounge with a couch and a TV. They probably put her in there.''  ''How many in the squad?''  ''Eight agents, an A-SAC, the secretary and an office manager. The office manager just went out on maternity leave, and the secretary must be at lunch. I hope. But they wouldn't have left Alice Kent alone. It's against policy. Somebody had to have stayed there with her.''  Bosch turned right on Third and immediately pulled to the curb. Ferras was already there, leaning casually against his Volvo station wagon. In front of it was another parked car. A federal cruiser. Bosch and Walling got out. Bosch approached Ferras, and Walling went to look into the fed car.  ''Have you seen Maxwell?'' Bosch asked.  ''Who?''  ''Agent Maxwell. The guy we put on the floor at the Kent house this morning.''  ''No, I haven't seen anybody. What --''  ''It's his car,'' Walling said as she joined them.  ''Ignacio, this is Agent Walling.''  ''Call me Iggy.''  ''Rachel.''  They shook hands.  ''O.K., then he's gotta be up there,'' Bosch said. ''How many stairwells?''  ''Three,'' Walling said. ''But he'll use the one that comes out by his car.''  She pointed to double steel doors with an exit sign above them. Bosch headed over that way to see if they were locked. Ferras and Walling followed.  ''What is going on?'' Ferras asked.  ''Maxwell is our shooter,'' Bosch said. ''He is up --''  ''What?''  Bosch checked the exit doors. There was no outside handle or knob. He turned to Ferras.  ''Look, there's not a lot of time. Trust me, Maxwell is our guy, and he's in this building to take out Alice Kent. We're --''  ''What is she doing here?''  ''The F.B.I. has a location here. She's here. No more questions, O.K.? Just listen. Agent Walling and I are going up the elevator. I want you out here by this door. If Maxwell comes out, you take him down. You understand?''  ''Got it.''  ''Good. Call for backup. We're going up.''  Bosch reached over and tapped Ferras on the cheek.  ''And stay frosty.''  They left Ferras there and headed through the entrance door. There was no lobby to speak of, just an elevator. It opened at the push of the button, and Walling used a key card to engage the ''7'' button. They started going up.  ''Something tells me you're never going to call him Iggy,'' Walling said.  Bosch ignored the comment but thought of something to ask.  ''Does this thing have a bell or a tone that sounds when it reaches the floor?''  ''I can't remem -- I think it does ... yes, definitely.''  ''Great. We'll be sitting ducks.''  Bosch pulled his gun out of its holster and Walling did the same. Bosch pushed Walling to one side of the elevator while he took the other. He raised his gun. The elevator finally reached seven and there was a soft bell tone from outside. The door began to slide open, exposing Bosch first.  No one was there.  Walling signaled that the offices were to the left after exiting the elevator. Bosch lowered himself into a combat crouch and stepped out, his gun up and ready.  Again, no one was there.  He started moving to his left. Rachel came out and moved with him on his right flank. They came to a loft-style office with two rows of cubicles -- the squad room -- and three private rooms that had been built free-standing in the open floor plan. There were large racks of electronic equipment between the cubicles, and every desk had two computer screens on it. It looked as if the whole place could be packed up and moved on a moment's notice.  Bosch stepped farther in, and through a window in one of the private offices he saw a man sitting in a chair, his head back and eyes open. It looked as if he were wearing a red bib. But Bosch knew it was blood. The man had been shot in the chest.  He pointed, and Walling saw the dead man. She reacted with a quick intake of breath and a low-volume sigh.  The door to the office was ajar. They moved toward it and Bosch pushed it open while Walling covered them from behind. Bosch stepped in and saw Alice Kent sitting on the floor, her back to the wall.  He crouched beside her. Her eyes were open but dead. A gun was on the floor between her feet, and the wall behind her was spattered with blood and brain matter.  Bosch turned and surveyed the room. He understood the play. It was set up so it would look as if Alice Kent had grabbed the agent's gun from his holster, shot him and then sat down on the floor and taken her own life. No note or explanation, but it was the best Maxwell could come up with in the short amount of time and opportunity he had.  Bosch turned to Walling. She had let her guard down and was just standing there looking at the dead agent.  ''Rachel --''  There were sudden shots from outside the room and the window shattered, spraying glass across the room. Maxwell had sprung from behind one of the electronics racks. Bosch rolled to his right and came up firing, putting six shots in a spread through the window into the squad room. He caught a glimpse of Maxwell at the last moment as he jumped from cover and hit a door with an exit sign hanging from the ceiling over it.  ''Rachel?''  ''I'm fine. Go!''  ''Which exit is that door?''  He pointed at the black door Maxwell had gone through. Walling stood up and looked. Bosch saw glass all over her clothes and that she had been cut on the cheek.  ''Those stairs go down to his car.''  Bosch ran from the room toward the exit door. He opened his phone as he went and pushed the speed dial for his partner. The call was answered on half a ring. Bosch had already hit the door and was in the stairwell.  ''He's coming down!''  Bosch dropped the phone and started down the stairs. He could hear Maxwell running on the steel steps below and instinctively knew that he was too far ahead.  Bosch covered three more landings, taking three steps at a time. He could hear Walling coming down behind him. He then heard the booming sound from below as Maxwell hit the exit door at the bottom. There were immediate shouts, and then there were shots. They came so close together that it was impossible to determine how many had been fired.  Ten seconds later Bosch hit the exit door. He ran out onto the sidewalk and saw Ferras leaning against the back bumper of Maxwell's fed car. He was holding his weapon with one hand and his elbow with the other. A red rose of blood was blooming on his shoulder. Traffic had stopped in both directions on Third, and pedestrians were running down the sidewalks to safety.  ''I hit him twice,'' Ferras yelled. ''He went that way.''  He nodded in the direction of the Third Street tunnel under Bunker Hill. Bosch stepped closer to his partner and saw the wound in the ball of his shoulder. It didn't look too bad.  ''Did you call for backup?'' Bosch asked.  ''On the way.''  Ferras grimaced as he adjusted his hold on his injured arm.  ''You did real good, Iggy. Hang in there while I go get this guy.''  Ferras nodded. Bosch turned and saw Walling come through the door, a smear of blood on her face.  ''This way,'' he said.  They started down Third in a spread formation. After a few steps Bosch picked up the trail. Maxwell was obviously hurt bad and was losing a lot of blood. It would make him easy to track.  But in another 20 feet it didn't matter. Maxwell stopped them with his voice. He called out from an alleyway running perpendicular to Third.  ''I just want to say ... that it was her. She wanted him dead. I just ... I just wanted her. That's all. But she wouldn't have it any other way ... and I did what she wanted. For that ... I am damned. ...''  Bosch quietly approached the corner on a wide turn. He had his gun up and ready. Then Maxwell spoke again.  ''I'm sorry,'' he said.  Then there was another shot. Bosch made the turn and saw Maxwell on the ground leaning against the wall, his gun on the pavement between his outstretched legs. In his suicide he adopted the same position as his lover, the woman he had just killed.  Walling stood next to Bosch and looked down at the dead agent. She said nothing. Bosch checked his watch. It was almost noon. He had ridden the case from beginning to end in 12 hours. The tally was four dead, one wounded and one dying of radiation exposure.  And then there was Bosch. He wondered if he was going to be part of the tally by the time all was said and done. His throat was now blazing, and there was a heaviness in his chest.  He looked over at Walling and saw blood running down her cheek again. She would need stitches to close the wound.  ''You know what?'' he said. ''I'll take you to the hospital if you take me.''  She looked at him and smiled sort of sadly.  ''Throw in Iggy and you've got yourself a deal.''  Bosch left her there with Maxwell and walked out of the alley and back toward his partner. Backup units had just turned off Broadway onto Third. There were sirens blaring and crowds forming. Bosch decided he would leave it to the patrol officers to take charge of the crime scene. He leaned against the fender next to Ferras and told him that Maxwell had just killed himself.  ''Hell of a way to go, I guess,'' Ferras said.  Bosch nodded but kept silent. His thoughts moved down the streets and up the hills to the overlook, where the last thing Stanley Kent ever saw was the city spread before him in beautiful shimmering light. Bosch thought that maybe it wasn't so bad, for a last view. Maybe to Stanley it even looked like heaven.  Next week: The debut of ''Gentlemen of the Road,'' by Michael Chabon.

It wasn't the only similarity I saw in my own father, who once spent way too much time arguing with the post office because it refused to let him use Scotch tape on a stamp that had lost its stickiness. He just couldn't stand the idea that he had to throw the stamp away.  My dad always kept us up to date on where all the important papers were. Before he died, he gave us all a great gift: He made his own decision to forgo a feeding tube. He stated simply that he had had a good long life, and that it was time to go.  As Ms. Span so eloquently put it, it was a final act of parenthood. I admired him so much for having the strength and courage to make the decision. Because he spared us from having to make difficult, final choices, I was able to finally forgive him for so many other parental injustices.  Barbara Kagan  Clinton",

            "fulltext": "THE evidence lay throughout the yard of a modest home on Burns Road. A jumble of driftwood in the corner of the pebbled driveway. A rock wall built without mortar. And, most tellingly, a stout cylindrical cairn, reminiscent of the mysterious one that appeared on a nearby beach around Christmas.  Shelter Island is a small community, especially in winter, when the swell of tourists and seasonal residents recedes. Those who remain know one another by name. Yet a sophisticated cairn was erected, almost six feet high, on the north side of the causeway that leads to Ram Island, and no one knew the builder's identity.  On Jan. 4, the local newspaper, the Shelter Island Reporter, featured a picture of the cairn, which is made of concentric layers of well-balanced stones that taper to a point at the top. Four driftwood posts run through it, creating a spiral pattern around the shaft, and the interior is filled with rocks. If you lean on the cairn, it does not budge.  ''There's so many possibilities,'' Karen Boltax said in her Boltax Gallery last Sunday afternoon. ''There's a lot of artists here.''  She did not realize then that she knew the builder and would be a key in unraveling the mystery.  A piece of driftwood propped against a tuft of golden grass a few feet from the cairn provided the first substantial clue: ''Maya Emma'' was scrawled in charcoal.  ''I have a friend named Maya,'' said Lena Cordts, 11, who had gone to the beach that sunny Sunday with friends and their parents, Sarah Sherwood and Chris Mulligan of Shelter Island. ''She has a sister Emma, too,'' Lena told a reporter who had also stopped by.  Lena said Maya and Emma lived near St. Mary's Episcopal Church. A trip there found a house with driftwood, stones and a cairn on the property. Its residents were not home, but that was where Ms. Boltax came in. She knew the house, she said: Gary Buckner, a social studies teacher at Mattituck High School, his wife, Valerie Marvin, and two daughters, Maya and Emma, live there.  ''Val and Gary are very hip people,'' Ms. Boltax said. ''It wouldn't surprise me if they did the sculpture.''  It turns out that Mr. Buckner built it, and he feels uncomfortable calling it a sculpture.  ''I don't think of myself as an artist,'' he said on Monday. ''I call it a cairn.''  He built the cairn from materials he found on the beach and worked on it each weekend in December, saying he put in a few meditative hours just after sunrise and sometimes at ''the setting of the day.'' He showed the structure only to family and friends visiting from Brooklyn on Christmas. He had hoped to remain anonymous to the rest of the island and said he did not realize his daughters had left their names behind.  Although several admirers likened the cairn to work by the environmental sculptor Andy Goldsworthy, Mr. Buckner said he did not intend to create a piece of art. It was homage, he said, to its location, a peaceful ribbon of shore where the water slides smoothly inland and cedar trees thrive in the sandy soil.  ''I thought it was appropriate to leave an offering to a place where we all go,'' he said. ''We go when we're angry and confused. We go for peace, for an answer, for understanding. We go there and then we leave, and that's it. I wanted to leave something somewhat permanent.''  Acknowledging that the cairn may one day be destroyed by nature or human hand, Mr. Buckner said: ''I wanted it to be an observer of time and change. Even in its destruction, that's time itself.''  Already, the cairn has changed. Visitors have stuck pieces of curled seashell and a long brown feather between the outer stones.  ''I'm totally drawn,'' Ms. Sherwood said as she gazed at the cairn. ''It's a strangely primitive emotional thing.''  She said she and her family had built cairns in their travels around the world. ''But I think the level of our sophistication will now increase,'' she said.  Indeed, 50 yards down the beach, her husband and children were busy piling rocks.  MYSTERY",

            "fulltext": "A day after it was announced that Barbaro had had a setback in his recovery from the painful hoof disease laminitis, his condition remained largely unchanged Thursday, but his surgeon was cautiously optimistic.  ''I'm probably no different than the public at large in that I'm disappointed that he had a setback, but I'm not about to go jump off a bridge and neither are the Jacksons,'' said Dr. Dean Richardson, referring to Barbaro's owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson.  ''We've got some work ahead of us and we are trying to get him back to where we want him to be,'' Richardson said. ''We want to keep him comfortable, which has been our mantra from Day 1. As long as we can keep him comfortable, we will continue to move along.''  It was announced Wednesday that a portion of the hoof wall had separated from the rest of Barbaro's left foot. For complete recovery, the hoof, most of which was cut away when Barbaro first came down with laminitis last July, must regrow and support his weight.  ''It's all about the one area,'' Richardson said of the part of the hoof where there is damaged tissue. ''It's been slow going and it didn't hold up. What happened here, we knew it would have to happen at some point, it's just that it's more sore than we had hoped.''  Barbaro was being placed in a sling several hours a day to take weight off the foot. Newly taken X-rays revealed no additional complications in either the left or right hind leg. The right hind leg was broken during the running of the Preakness Stakes, eventually leading to the laminitis in the other leg.  Richardson said several procedures were being considered for treatment, but he declined to discuss what his plans might include.  ''It's a hitch I hope that he gets through,'' Roy Jackson said. ''I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen next. It's a day-to-day thing.''  HORSE RACING",

The effect is as if the part of her face that isn't made up has been erased. She is speaking in a loud voice so that her daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo), can hear her in the bedroom.  RAIMUNDA -- Paula! Get ready, people will start arriving in half an hour.  In her room, Paula, serious and indolent, is lying on her bed, still wearing a track suit. She is reading a book by Paul Auster and doesn't deign to answer her mother. As she doesn't get an answer, Raimunda goes into Paula's room.  RAIMUNDA -- (fondly) Are you still like that?  PAULA -- I'm not in the mood for a party.  RAIMUNDA -- Neither am I, but it's work. Come on, don't be such a lazybones. I'll help you. What's wrong?  Raimunda sits on the bed with her daughter.  PAULA -- (serious) I can't get him out of my head when he's so close, there, in the storeroom.  Raimunda's forced optimism fades.  RAIMUNDA -- That's the best way to drive yourself crazy and to drive me crazy, too!  PAULA -- Mom, you don't know what it's like to have killed your father!  Raimunda looks at her and from her expression seems to be saying: ''There are some fathers who deserve it'' or ''You were just defending yourself.'' However, she says:  RAIMUNDA -- Paco wasn't your father.  PAULA -- Mom, don't lie to me anymore. I know you're doing it for me, but please, don't lie.  Raimunda's recently painted eyes fill up with tears that don't quite overflow. Defeated, wearily:  RAIMUNDA -- I'm not lying. Paco recognized you as his daughter, but he knew he wasn't your biological father.  On the bedside table there is a framed photo of the three. Paula is just a baby. Paco is rocking her lovingly in his arms. Paula looks at the photo.  PAULA -- Then  he was telling the truth.  RAIMUNDA -- (without any viciousness, but firmly) Yes, but that doesn't justify what he did.  Paula, curious and stunned, looks at her mother, overwhelmed by memories.  RAIMUNDA -- (pleading) I promise I'll tell you everything, another time. I swear. And now, let's get ready. There's no point in sitting here.  PAULA -- Who was my father?  RAIMUNDA -- Someone from the village.  PAULA -- Do I know him?  RAIMUNDA -- He's dead. (Pleading) Paula, I swear I'll tell you everything.  Paula looks at her and agrees.

            "fulltext": "Bosch's search of the radiation victim's clothes has yielded no cesium. It turns out that he's Mexican, and Agent Walling tries to connect him to the Middle Eastern terrorists, who were believed to have entered the United States through the Mexican border. But Bosch isn't convinced.  Harry Bosch knew that the physics of traffic would not work for him in the Cahuenga Pass. The Hollywood Freeway always moved slowly in both directions through the bottleneck created by the cut in the mountain chain. He decided to stay on surface streets and take Highland Avenue past the Hollywood Bowl and up into the pass. He filled Rachel Walling in along the way.  ''The call for paramedics came from a print shop on Cahuenga near Lankershim. Gonzalves must have been in the area when he collapsed. The initial call said a man was down in the parking lot. I'm hoping that the Toyota he was driving is right there. I'm betting that if we find it, we find the cesium. The mystery is why he had it.''  ''And why he was foolish enough to put it unprotected in his pocket,'' Walling added.  ''You're basing that on him knowing what he had. Maybe he didn't. Maybe this isn't what we think it is.''  ''There's got to be a connection, Bosch, between Gonzalves and Nassar and Elfayed. He probably brought them across the border.''  ''We'll see.''  He almost smiled. He knew she had used his last name as a term of endearment. He remembered how she used to do that.  He took the ramp up to Cahuenga from Highland. It ran parallel to the freeway, and as soon as he checked, he saw that he had been right. The freeway was frozen in both directions.  ''You know, I still had your number in my cell's directory,'' he said. ''I guess I never wanted to delete it.''  ''I was wondering about that when you left me that mean message today about the cigarette ash.''  ''I don't suppose you kept mine, Rachel.''  She paused a long moment before answering.  ''I think you're still on my phone, too, Harry.''  This time he had to smile, even though he was back to being Harry with her. There's hope after all, he thought.  They were approaching Lankershim Boulevard. To the right it dropped down into a tunnel beneath the freeway. To the left it ended at a strip mall that included the Easy Print franchise from which the call to paramedics had originated. Bosch's eyes searched the vehicles in the small parking lot, looking for a Toyota.  He glided into the left-turn lane and waited to pull into the lot. He swiveled in his seat and checked the parking along both sides of Cahuenga. The quick glance showed no Toyotas, but he knew the brand had many different car models and pickup trucks. If they didn't find the car in the print-shop lot, they would have to work the curbside parking to look for it.  ''Do you have a plate or any description?'' Walling asked. ''How about a color?''  ''No, no and no.''  Bosch remembered then that she had the habit of asking multiple questions at once.  He made the turn on yellow and pulled into the lot. There were no parking spaces available, but he wasn't interested in parking. He cruised slowly, checking each car. There were no Toyotas.  ''Where's a Toyota when you need one?'' he said. ''It's got to be in this area somewhere.''  ''Maybe we should check the street,'' Walling suggested.  He nodded and nosed his car into the alley at the end of the parking lot. He was going to turn left to turn around and go back to the street. But when he checked to see if he was clear on the right, he saw an old white pickup truck with a camper shell parked half a block down the alley next to a green Dumpster. The truck was facing them, and he couldn't tell what make it was.  ''Is that a Toyota?'' he asked.  Walling turned and looked.  ''Bosch, you're a genius,'' she exclaimed.  Bosch turned and drove toward the truck, and as he got closer, he could see that it was indeed a Toyota. So could Walling. She pulled out her phone, but Bosch reached across and put his hand on it.  ''Let's just check it out first. I could be wrong about this.''  ''No, Bosch, you're on a roll.''  But she put the phone away. Bosch pulled slowly past the pickup, giving it a once-over. He then turned around at the end of the block and came back. He stopped his car 10 feet behind it. There was no plate on the back. A cardboard ''Lost Tag'' sign had been put in its place.  Bosch wished he had brought the keys he found in Digiberto Gonzalves's pocket. They got out and approached the truck, coming up on either side of it. When he got close, Bosch noticed that the rear-window hatch of the camper shell had been left open a couple of inches. He reached forward and pulled it up and open all the way. An air-pressure hinge held it open. Bosch leaned in close to look into the interior. It was dark because the truck was parked in shadow and the windows on the shell were darkly tinted.  ''Harry, you have that monitor?''  He pulled her radiation monitor off his belt and held it up in his hand as he leaned into the darkness of the truck's cargo hold. No alarm sounded. He leaned back out and put the monitor back on his belt. He then reached in to the latch and lowered the truck's rear gate.  The back of the truck was piled with junk. There were empty bottles and cans strewn everywhere, a leather desk chair with a broken leg, scrap pieces of aluminum, an old water cooler and other debris. And there by the raised wheel well on the right side was a gray lead container that looked like a small mop bucket on wheels.  ''Is that the pig?'' he asked.  ''I think it is,'' Walling said excitedly. ''I think it is!''  There was no warning sticker on it or radiation-alert symbol. They had been peeled off. Bosch leaned into the truck and grabbed one of the handles. He pulled it clear of the debris around it and rolled it to the tailgate. The top was latched in four places.  ''Do we open it and make sure the stuff is in there?'' he asked.  ''No,'' Walling said. ''We back off and call in the team. They have protection.''  She pulled her phone out again. While she called for the radiation team and backup units Bosch moved to the front of the truck. He looked through the window and into the cab. He saw more junk on the passenger side. His eyes held on a camera that was sitting on an old briefcase with a broken handle on the passenger seat. It didn't appear to be broken or dirty. It looked brand-new.  Bosch checked the door and found it unlocked. He realized that Gonzalves had forgotten about his truck and his possessions when the cesium started burning his body. He had gotten out and stumbled toward the parking lot seeking help, leaving everything behind and unlocked.  Bosch opened the driver's door and reached in with the radiation monitor. Nothing happened. No alert. He replaced it on his belt and walked back to his car. From the equipment kit in the trunk he got out a pair of latex gloves and put them on.  When he walked back past Walling, she was talking to someone about finding the pig. He moved back to the truck's cab. He leaned in and picked up the camera. It was a Nikon digital, and he remembered the lens cap found beneath the master bed at the Kent house by the SID team. He believed he was holding the camera that had taken the photograph of Alice Kent.  Bosch put the camera down and began looking through the things piled on the passenger seat. There was the broken briefcase, a child's lunch box, a manual for operating an Apple computer and a poker from a fireplace tool set. Nothing connected, and nothing interested him. He noticed a golf putter and a rolled-up poster on the floor.  He shifted his weight to one elbow on the armrest between the seats so that he could reach over and open the glove compartment. And there, sitting in the otherwise empty space, was a gun. Bosch lifted it out and turned it in his hand. It was a Smith & Wesson .22-caliber revolver.  ''I think we've got the murder weapon here,'' he called out.  There was no response from Walling. She was still at the back of the truck talking on her phone, now issuing orders in a hurried voice.  Bosch returned the weapon to the glove box and closed it, deciding to leave the weapon in its place for the forensics team. He noticed the poster again and decided for no reason other than curiosity to take a look at it. He unrolled it across all of the junk on the passenger seat. It was a chart depicting 12 yoga positions.  Bosch immediately thought about the discolored space he had seen on the wall in the workout room at the Kent house. He wasn't sure, but he thought the dimensions of the poster would match that space. He quickly rerolled the poster and started to back out of the cab so he could show Walling his discovery.  But as he was pulling out, he noticed that the armrest was also a storage compartment. He stopped and opened it.  He froze. There was a cup holder and in it were several steel capsules resembling bullet cartridges closed flat on both ends. The steel was so polished it almost looked like silver.  Bosch moved the radiation monitor over the capsules in a circular pattern. There was no alarm. He turned the device over in his hand and looked at it. He saw a small switch on its side. With his thumb he pushed it up. A blaring alarm suddenly went off, the frequency of tones so fast that it sounded like one long, ear-piercing siren.  Bosch jumped back out of the truck and slammed the door shut. The poster fell to the ground.  ''Harry!'' Walling yelled. ''What?''  She rushed toward him, closing her phone on her hip. Bosch pushed the switch again and turned the monitor off.  ''What is it?'' she yelled.  Bosch pointed toward the truck's door.  ''The gun's in the glove box and the cesium's in the center compartment.''  ''What?''  ''The cesium is in the compartment under the armrest. He took the capsules out of the pig. That's why they weren't in his pocket. They were in the center armrest.''  He touched his right hip, the place where Gonzalves was burned by radiation. The same spot would have been next to the armrest compartment if he was sitting in the truck.  Rachel didn't say anything for a long moment. She just stared at his face.  ''Are you O.K.?'' she finally asked.  Bosch almost laughed.  ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Ask me in about 10 years.''  She hesitated as if she knew something but couldn't share it.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing. You should be checked out, though.''  ''What are they going to be able to do? Look, I wasn't in the truck that long. It's not like Gonzalves, who was sitting in there with it.''  She didn't answer. Bosch handed her the monitor.  ''It was never on. I thought it was on when you gave it to me.''  She took it and looked at it in her hand.  ''I thought it was, too.''  Bosch looked back at the truck and wondered if he had just hurt or killed himself.  ''I need a drink of water,'' he said. ''I've got a bottle in the trunk.''  Bosch walked to the back of his car. Using the open trunk lid to shield Walling's view of him, he leaned his hands down onto the bumper for support and tried to decipher the messages his body was sending to his brain. He felt something happening but didn't know if it was something physically occurring to him or just the emotional response -- the shakes -- to what had just happened. He suddenly thought of his daughter, getting a vision of her at the airport the last time he saw her.  He cursed out loud.  ''Harry?''  Bosch looked around the trunk lid. Rachel was walking toward him.  ''The teams are headed this way. They'll be here in five minutes. How do you feel?''  ''I think I'm O.K.''  He reached into the trunk and got a liter bottle of water out of his kit. It was an emergency bottle he kept for surveillances that dragged on longer than expected. He opened it and took two strong pulls. The water wasn't cold, but it felt good going down. His throat was dry.  Bosch recapped the bottle and put it back in the kit. He stepped around the car to Walling. As he walked toward her he looked past her to the south. He realized that the alley they were in extended several blocks past the back of the Easy Print and ran behind all the storefronts and offices on Cahuenga. All the way down to Barham.  Every 20 yards or so there was a green Dumpster positioned perpendicular to the rear of the structures. Bosch realized that the Dumpsters had been pushed out of spaces between the buildings and fenced corrals. It was pickup day, and the Dumpsters were waiting for the city trucks to come.  Suddenly it all came to him. Like fusion. Like two elements coming together and creating a new element. It all came together for Bosch in that moment. The thing that bothered him about the photos, the yoga poster, everything. The gamma rays had shot right through him, but they had left him enlightened. He knew. He understood.  ''He's a scavenger.''  ''Who is?''  ''Digiberto Gonzalves,'' Bosch said, his eyes looking down the alley. ''It's collection day. The Dumpsters are all pushed out for the city trucks. Gonzalves is a scavenger, a Dumpster diver, and he knew they would be out and this would be a good time to come here. ...  ''And so did somebody else.''  ''You mean he found the cesium in a Dumpster?''  Bosch nodded and pointed down the alley.  ''All the way at the end, that's Barham. Barham takes you up to Lake Hollywood. Lake Hollywood takes you to the overlook. This case never leaves the page.''  Walling came over and stood in front of him, blocking his view. Bosch could hear sirens in the distance.  ''What are you saying? That Nassar and Elfayed took the cesium and stashed it in a Dumpster at the bottom of the hill? Then this scavenger comes along and finds it?''  ''I'm saying you've got the cesium back, so now we're looking at this as a homicide again. You come down from the overlook, and you can be in this alley in five minutes.''  ''So what? They stole the cesium and killed Kent just so they could come down here and stash it? Is that what you're saying? Or are you saying they just threw it all away? Why would they do that? I mean, does that make any sense at all?''  Bosch noted that she had asked six questions at once this time, possibly a new record.  ''Nassar and Elfayed were never near the cesium,'' he said. ''That's what I'm saying.''  He walked over to the truck and picked the poster up off the ground. He handed it to Rachel. The sirens were getting louder.  She unrolled the poster in her hands and looked at it.  ''What is this? What does it mean?''  Bosch took it back from her and started rolling it back up.  ''Gonzalves found that in the same Dumpster he found the gun and the camera and the lead pig.''  ''So? What does it mean, Harry?''  Two fed cars pulled into the alley a block away and started making their way toward them, weaving around the Dumpsters pushed out for pickup. As they got close, Bosch could see that the driver of the lead car was Jack Brenner.  ''Do you hear me, Harry? What does it --''  Bosch's knees suddenly seemed to give out and he fell into her, throwing his arms around her to stop himself from hitting the ground.  ''Bosch!''  She grabbed on and held him.  ''Uh ... I'm not feeling so good,'' he mumbled. ''I think I better. ... Can you take me to my car?''  She helped him straighten up and then started walking him toward his car. He put his arm over her shoulders. Car doors were slamming behind them as the agents got out.  ''Where are the keys?'' Walling asked.  He held the key ring up to her just as Brenner ran up to them.  ''What is it? What's wrong?''  ''He was exposed. The cesium is in the center console in the truck cab. Be careful. I'm going to take him to the hospital.''  Brenner stepped back, as if whatever Bosch had was contagious.  ''O.K.,'' he said. ''Call me when you can.''  Bosch and Walling kept moving toward the car.  ''Come on, Bosch,'' Walling said. ''Stay with me. Hang in there and we'll get you taken care of.''  Bosch almost smiled. She had called him by his last name.  Next week: Reeling from exposure, Bosch fingers the wrong man.

And, most tellingly, a stout cylindrical cairn, reminiscent of the mysterious one that appeared on a nearby beach around Christmas.  Shelter Island is a small community, especially in winter, when the swell of tourists and seasonal residents recedes. Those who remain know one another by name. Yet a sophisticated cairn was erected, almost six feet high, on the north side of the causeway that leads to Ram Island, and no one knew the builder's identity.  On Jan. 4, the local newspaper, the Shelter Island Reporter, featured a picture of the cairn, which is made of concentric layers of well-balanced stones that taper to a point at the top. Four driftwood posts run through it, creating a spiral pattern around the shaft, and the interior is filled with rocks. If you lean on the cairn, it does not budge.  ''There's so many possibilities,'' Karen Boltax said in her Boltax Gallery last Sunday afternoon. ''There's a lot of artists here.''  She did not realize then that she knew the builder and would be a key in unraveling the mystery.  A piece of driftwood propped against a tuft of golden grass a few feet from the cairn provided the first substantial clue: ''Maya Emma'' was scrawled in charcoal.  ''I have a friend named Maya,'' said Lena Cordts, 11, who had gone to the beach that sunny Sunday with friends and their parents, Sarah Sherwood and Chris Mulligan of Shelter Island. ''She has a sister Emma, too,'' Lena told a reporter who had also stopped by.  Lena said Maya and Emma lived near St. Mary's Episcopal Church. A trip there found a house with driftwood, stones and a cairn on the property. Its residents were not home, but that was where Ms. Boltax came in. She knew the house, she said: Gary Buckner, a social studies teacher at Mattituck High School, his wife, Valerie Marvin, and two daughters, Maya and Emma, live there.  ''Val and Gary are very hip people,'' Ms. Boltax said. ''It wouldn't surprise me if they did the sculpture.''  It turns out that Mr. Buckner built it, and he feels uncomfortable calling it a sculpture.  ''I don't think of myself as an artist,'' he said on Monday. ''I call it a cairn.''  He built the cairn from materials he found on the beach and worked on it each weekend in December, saying he put in a few meditative hours just after sunrise and sometimes at ''the setting of the day.'' He showed the structure only to family and friends visiting from Brooklyn on Christmas. He had hoped to remain anonymous to the rest of the island and said he did not realize his daughters had left their names behind.  Although several admirers likened the cairn to work by the environmental sculptor Andy Goldsworthy, Mr. Buckner said he did not intend to create a piece of art. It was homage, he said, to its location, a peaceful ribbon of shore where the water slides smoothly inland and cedar trees thrive in the sandy soil.  ''I thought it was appropriate to leave an offering to a place where we all go,'' he said. ''We go when we're angry and confused. We go for peace, for an answer, for understanding. We go there and then we leave, and that's it. I wanted to leave something somewhat permanent.''  Acknowledging that the cairn may one day be destroyed by nature or human hand, Mr. Buckner said: ''I wanted it to be an observer of time and change. Even in its destruction, that's time itself.''  Already, the cairn has changed. Visitors have stuck pieces of curled seashell and a long brown feather between the outer stones.  ''I'm totally drawn,'' Ms. Sherwood said as she gazed at the cairn. ''It's a strangely primitive emotional thing.''  She said she and her family had built cairns in their travels around the world. ''But I think the level of our sophistication will now increase,'' she said.  Indeed, 50 yards down the beach, her husband and children were busy piling rocks.  MYSTERY",

He just couldn't stand the idea that he had to throw the stamp away.  My dad always kept us up to date on where all the important papers were. Before he died, he gave us all a great gift: He made his own decision to forgo a feeding tube. He stated simply that he had had a good long life, and that it was time to go.  As Ms. Span so eloquently put it, it was a final act of parenthood. I admired him so much for having the strength and courage to make the decision. Because he spared us from having to make difficult, final choices, I was able to finally forgive him for so many other parental injustices.  Barbara Kagan  Clinton, Conn.",

            "fulltext": "Sometimes I feel that living in New York City, having a good family and friends, and just being alive is a dream, that perhaps this second life of mine isn't really happening. Whenever I speak at the United Nations, Unicef or elsewhere to raise awareness of the continual and rampant recruitment of children in wars around the world, I come to realize that I still do not fully understand how I could have possibly survived the civil war in my country, Sierra Leone.  Most of my friends, after meeting the woman whom I think of as my new mother, a Brooklyn-born white Jewish-American, assume that I was either adopted at a very young age or that my mother married an African man. They would never imagine that I was 17 when I came to live with her and that I had been a child soldier and participated in one of the most brutal wars in recent history.  In early 1993, when I was 12, I was separated from my family as the Sierra Leone civil war, which began two years earlier, came into my life. The rebel army, known as the Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F.), attacked my town in the southern part of the country. I ran away, along paths and roads that were littered with dead bodies, some mutilated in ways so horrible that looking at them left a permanent scar on my memory. I ran for days, weeks and months, and I couldn't believe that the simple and precious world I had known, where nights were celebrated with storytelling and dancing and mornings greeted with the singing of birds and cock crows, was now a place where only guns spoke and sometimes it seemed even the sun hesitated to shine. After I discovered that my parents and two brothers had been killed, I felt even more lost and worthless in a world that had become pregnant with fear and suspicion as neighbor turned against neighbor and child against parent. Surviving each passing minute was nothing short of a miracle.  After almost a year of running, I, along with some friends I met along the way, arrived at an army base in the southeastern region. We thought we were now safe; little did we know what lay ahead.  1994: The First Battle  I have never been so afraid to go anywhere in my life as I was that first day. As we walked into the arms of the forest, tears began to form in my eyes, but I struggled to hide them and gripped my gun for comfort. We exhaled quietly, afraid that our own breathing could cause our deaths. The lieutenant led the line that I was in. He raised his fist in the air, and we stopped moving. Then he slowly brought it down, and we sat on one heel, our eyes surveying the forest. We began to move swiftly among the bushes until we came to the edge of a swamp, where we formed an ambush, aiming our guns into the bog. We lay flat on our stomachs and waited. I was lying next to my friend Josiah. At 11, he was even younger than I was. Musa, a friend my age, 13, was also nearby. I looked around to see if I could catch their eyes, but they were concentrating on the invisible target in the swamp. The tops of my eyes began to ache, and the pain slowly rose up to my head. My ears became warm, and tears were running down my cheeks, even though I wasn't crying. The veins on my arms stood out, and I could feel them pulsating as if they had begun to breathe of their own accord. We waited in the quiet, as hunters do. The silence tormented me.  The short trees in the swamp began to shake as the rebels made their way through them. They weren't yet visible, but the lieutenant had passed the word down through a whisper that was relayed like a row of falling dominos: ''Fire on my command.'' As we watched, a group of men dressed in civilian clothes emerged from under the tiny bushes. They waved their hands, and more fighters came out. Some were boys, as young as we were. They sat together in line, waving their hands, discussing a strategy. My lieutenant ordered a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) to be fired, but the commander of the rebels heard it as it whooshed its way out of the forest. ''Retreat!'' he called out to his men, and the grenade's blast got only a few rebels, whose split bodies flew in the air. The explosion was followed by an exchange of gunfire from both sides.  I lay there with my gun pointed in front of me, unable to shoot. My index finger became numb. I felt as if the forest had turned upside down and I was going to fall off, so I clutched the base of a tree with one hand. I couldn't think, but I could hear the sounds of the guns far away in the distance and the cries of people dying in pain. A splash of blood hit my face. In my reverie I had opened my mouth a bit, so I tasted some of the blood. As I spat it out and wiped it off my face, I saw the soldier it had come from. Blood poured out of the bullet holes in him like water rushing through newly opened tributaries. His eyes were wide open; he still held his gun. My eyes were fixed on him when I heard Josiah screaming for his mother in the most painfully piercing voice I had ever heard. It vibrated inside my head to the point that I felt my brain had shaken loose from its anchor.  I searched for Josiah. An RPG had tossed his tiny body off the ground, and he had landed on a tree stump. He wiggled his legs as his cry gradually came to an end. There was blood everywhere. It seemed as if bullets were falling into the forest from all angles. I crawled to Josiah and looked into his eyes. There were tears in them, and his lips were shaking, but he couldn't speak. As I watched him, the water in his eyes was replaced with blood that quickly turned his brown eyes red. He reached for my shoulder as if to pull himself up. But midway, he stopped moving. The gunshots faded in my head, and it was as if my heart had stopped and the whole world had come to a standstill. I covered his eyes with my fingers and lifted him from the tree stump. His backbone had been shattered. I placed him flat on the ground and picked up my gun. I didn't realize that I had stood up to take Josiah off the tree stump. I felt someone tugging at my foot. It was the corporal; he was saying something that I couldn't understand. His mouth moved, and he looked terrified. He pulled me down, and as I hit the ground, I felt my brain shaking in my skull again, and my deafness gave way.  ''Get down,'' he was screaming. ''Shoot,'' he said, as he crawled away from me to resume his position. As I looked to where he lay, my eyes caught Musa, whose head was covered with blood. His hands looked too relaxed. I turned toward the swamp, where there were gunmen running, trying to cross over. My face, my hands, my shirt and my gun were drenched in blood. I raised my gun and pulled the trigger, and I killed a man. Suddenly all the death I had seen since the day I was touched by war began flashing in my head. Every time I stopped shooting to change magazines and saw my two lifeless friends, I angrily pointed my gun into the swamp and killed more people. I shot everything that moved, until we were ordered to retreat because we needed another plan.  We took the guns and ammunition off the bodies of my friends and left them there in the forest, which had taken on a life of its own, as if it had trapped the souls that had departed from the dead. The branches of the trees seemed to be holding hands and bowing their heads in prayer. In the swamp, crabs had already begun feasting on the eyes of the dead. Limbs and fragmented skulls lay on top of the bog, and the water in the swamp was stagnant with blood. I was not afraid of these lifeless bodies. I despised them and kicked them to flip them and take their guns. I found a G3 and some ammunition. I noticed that most of the dead gunmen and boys wore lots of jewelry on their necks and wrists.  We arrived in the village, our base, with nightfall and sat against the walls of houses. It was quiet, and perhaps afraid of the silence, we began cleaning the blood off our guns, oiling their chambers, and shooting them into the air to test their effectiveness. I went for supper that night but was unable to eat. I only drank water and felt nothing. I lay on my back in the tent with my AK-47 on my chest and the G3 I had taken from a dead rebel leaning on the peg of the tent. Nothing happened in my head. It was a void, and I stared at the roof of the tent until I was miraculously able to doze off. I had a dream that I was picking up Josiah from the tree stump and a gunman stood on top of me. He placed his gun against my forehead. I immediately woke up from my dream and began shooting inside the tent, until the 30 rounds in the magazine were finished. The corporal and the lieutenant came in afterward and took me outside. I was sweating, and they threw water on my face and gave me a few white capsules. They were the same capsules that we'd all been given before we had gone into battle, and to this day, I do not know what they contained. I stayed up all night and couldn't sleep for days. We went out two more times that week, and I had no problem shooting my gun.  Rebel Raids  After that first week of going out on raids to kill people we deemed our rebel enemies or sympathizers of the rebels, our initiation was complete. We stayed put at the base, and we boys took turns guarding posts around the village. We smoked marijuana and sniffed ''brown brown,'' cocaine mixed with gunpowder, which was always spread out on a table near the ammunition hut, and of course I took more of the white capsules, as I had become addicted to them. The first time I took all these drugs at the same time, I began to perspire so much that I took off all my clothes. My body shook, my sight became blurred and I lost my hearing for several minutes. I walked around the village restlessly. But after several doses of these drugs, all I felt was numbness to everything and so much energy that I couldn't sleep for weeks. We watched war movies at night, Rambo ''First Blood,'' ''Rambo, First Blood, Part II,'' ''Commando'' and so on, with the aid of a generator or a car battery. We all wanted to be like Rambo; we couldn't wait to implement his techniques.  When we ran out of supplies, we raided rebel camps in towns, villages and forests. ''We have good news from our informants'' the lieutenant would announce. ''We are moving out in five minutes to kill some rebels and take their supplies, which really belong to us.'' He often made speeches about how we were defending our country, how honorable we were. At these times, I would stand holding my gun and feeling special because I was part of something that took me seriously and I was not running from anyone anymore. The lieutenant's face evinced confidence; his smiles disappeared before they were completed. We would tie our heads with the green cloths that distinguished us from the rebels, and we boys would lead the way. There were no maps and no questions asked. We were simply told to follow the path until we received instructions on what to do next. We walked for long hours and stopped only to eat sardines and corned beef with gari, sniff brown brown and take more white capsules. The combination of these drugs made us fierce. The idea of death didn't cross my mind, and killing had become as easy as drinking water. After that first killing, my mind had stopped making remorseful records, or so it seemed.  Before we got to a rebel camp, we would deviate from the path and walk in the forest. Once the camp was in sight, we would surround it and wait for the lieutenant's command. The rebels roamed about; some sat against walls, dozing off, and others, boys as young as we, stood at guard posts passing around marijuana. Whenever I looked at rebels during raids, my entire body shook with fury; they were the people who had shot my friends and family. So when the lieutenant gave orders, I shot as many as I could, but I didn't feel better. After every gunfight, we would enter the rebel camp, killing those we had wounded. We would then search the houses and gather gallons of gasoline, enormous amounts of marijuana and cocaine, bales of clothes, watches, rice, salt, gari and many other things. We rounded up any civilians -- men, women, boys and young girls -- hiding in the huts and houses and made them carry our loot back to the base. We shot them if they tried to run away.  On one of these raids, we captured a few rebels after a long gunfight and a lot of civilian casualties. We undressed the prisoners and tied their arms behind their backs until their chests were tight as drums. ''Where did you get all this ammunition from?'' the corporal asked one of the prisoners, a man with an almost dreadlocked beard. He spat in the corporal's face, and the corporal immediately shot him in the head at close range. He fell to the ground, and blood slowly leaked out of his head. We cheered in admiration of the corporal's action and saluted him as he walked by. Suddenly, a rebel hiding in the bushes shot one of our boys. We dispersed around the village in search of the shooter. When the young muscular rebel was captured, the lieutenant slit his neck with his bayonet. The rebel ran before he fell to the ground and stopped moving. We cheered again, raising our guns in the air, shouting and whistling.  During that time, a lot of things were done with no reason or explanation. Sometimes we were asked to leave for war in the middle of a movie. We would come back hours later after killing many people and continue the movie as if we had just returned from intermission. We were always either on the front lines, watching a war movie or doing drugs. There was no time to be alone or to think. When we conversed with one another, we talked only about the movies and how impressed we were with the way either the lieutenant, the corporal or one of us had killed someone. It was as if nothing else existed.  The villages that we captured and turned into our bases as we went along and the forests that we slept in became my home. My squad was my family, my gun was my provider and protector and my rule was to kill or be killed. The extent of my thoughts didn't go much beyond that. We had been fighting for more than two years, and killing had become a daily activity. I felt no pity for anyone. My childhood had gone by without my knowing, and it seemed as if my heart had frozen. I knew that day and night came and went because of the presence of the moon and the sun, but I had no idea whether it was a Sunday or a Friday.  Taken From the Front  In my head my life was normal. But everything began to change in January 1996. I was 15.  One morning that month, a truck came to the village where we were based. Four men dressed in clean blue jeans and white T-shirts that said ''Unicef'' in big blue letters jumped out. They were shown to the lieutenant's house. It seemed as if he had been expecting them. As they sat talking on the veranda, we watched them from under the mango tree, where we sat cleaning our guns. Soon all the boys were told to line up for the lieutenant who selected a few of us and asked the adult soldiers to take away our guns and ammunition. A bunch of boys, including my friend Alhaji and me, were ushered to the truck. I stared back at the veranda where the lieutenant now stood, looking in the other direction, toward the forest, his hands crossed behind his back. I still didn't know exactly what was going on, but I was beginning to get angry and anxious. Why had the lieutenant decided to give us up to these civilians? We thought that we were part of the war until the end.  We were on the road for hours. I had gotten used to always moving and hadn't sat in one place idly for a long time. It was night when the truck stopped at a center, where there were other boys whose appearances, red eyes and somber faces resembled ours. Alhaji and I looked at this group, and he asked the boys who they were. A boy who was sitting on the stoop angrily said: ''We fought for the R.U.F.; the army is the enemy. We fought for freedom, and the army killed my family and destroyed my village. I will kill any of those army bastards every time I get a chance to do so.'' The boy took off his shirt to fight, and on his arm was the R.U.F. brand. Mambu, one of the boys on our side, shouted, ''They are rebels,'' and reached for his bayonet, which he had hidden in his army shorts; most of us had hidden either a knife or a grenade before our guns were taken from us. Before Mambu could grab his weapon, the R.U.F. boy punched him in the face. He fell, and when he got up, his nose was bleeding. The rebel boys drew out the few bayonets they had in their shorts and rushed toward us. It was war all over again. Perhaps the na\u00efve men who had taken us to the center thought that removing us from the war would lessen our hatred for the R.U.F. It hadn't crossed their minds that a change of environment wouldn't immediately make us normal boys; we were dangerous, brainwashed to kill.  One boy grabbed my neck from behind. He was squeezing for the kill, and I couldn't use my bayonet effectively, so I elbowed him with all my might until he let go. He was holding his stomach when I turned around and stabbed him in his foot. The bayonet stuck, so I pulled it out with force. He fell, and I began kicking him in the face. As I went to deliver the final blow with my bayonet, someone came from behind me and sliced my hand with his knife. It was a rebel boy, and he was about to kick me down when he fell on his face. Alhaji had stabbed him in the back. He pulled the knife out, and we started kicking the boy until he stopped moving. I wasn't sure whether he was unconscious or dead. I didn't care. No one screamed or cried during the fight. After all, we had been doing such things for years and were all still on drugs.  We continued to stab and slice one another until a bunch of MPs came running through the gate toward the fight. The MPs fired a few rounds into the air to get us to stop, but we were still fighting, so they had to part us by force. They placed some of us at gunpoint and kicked others apart. Six people were killed: two on our side and four on the rebel side.  As MPs stood guard to make sure we didn't start another fight, we, the army boys, went to the kitchen to look for food. We ate and chatted about the fight. Mambu told us that he had plucked an eye out of the head of one of the R.U.F. boys, and that the boy ran to punch him, but he couldn't see, so he ran into the wall, banging his head hard and fainting. We laughed and picked up Mambu, raising him in the air. We needed the violence to cheer us after a whole day of boring travel and contemplation about why our superiors had let us go.  That night we were moved to a rehabilitation center called Benin Home. Benin Home was run by a local NGO called Children Associated With the War, in Kissy neighborhood, on the eastern outskirts of Freetown, the capital. This time, the MPs made sure to search us thoroughly before we entered. The blood of our victims and enemies was fresh on our arms and clothes. My lieutenant's words still echoed in my head: ''From now on, we kill any rebel we see, no prisoners.'' I smiled a bit, happy that we had taken care of the rebel boys, but I also began to wonder again: Why had we been taken here? I walked up and down on the veranda, restless in my new environment. My head began to hurt.  Relearning Boyhood  It was infuriating to be told what to do by civilians. Their voices, even when they called us for breakfast, enraged me so much that I would punch the wall, my locker or anything nearby. A few days earlier, we could have decided whether they would live or die.  We refused to do anything that we were asked to do, except eat. At the end of every meal, the staff members and nurses came to talk to us about attending the scheduled medical checkups and the one-on-one counseling sessions that we hated at the minihospital that was part of Benin Home. As soon as the live-in staff, mostly men, started telling us what to do, we would throw bowls, spoons, food and benches at them. We would chase them out of the dining hall and beat them. One afternoon, after we had chased off several staff members, we placed a bucket over the cook's head and pushed him around the kitchen until he burned his hand on a boiling pot and agreed to put more milk in our tea. During that same week, the drugs were wearing off. I craved cocaine and marijuana so badly that I would roll a plain sheet of paper and smoke it. Sometimes I searched the pockets of my army shorts, which I still wore, for crumbs of marijuana or cocaine. We broke into the minihospital and stole some painkillers -- white tablets and off-white -- and red and yellow capsules. We emptied the capsules, ground the tablets and mixed them together. But the mixture didn't give us the effect we wanted. We got more upset day by day and, as a result, resorted to more violence. We began to fight one another day and night. We would fight for hours for no reason at all. At first the staff would intervene, but after a while they just let us go. They couldn't really stop us, and perhaps they thought that we would get this out of our systems. During these fights, we destroyed most of the furniture and threw the mattresses out in the yard. We would stop to wipe the blood off our lips, arms and legs only when the bell rang for mealtime.  It had been more than a month, and some of us had almost gone through the withdrawal stage, even though there were still instances of vomiting and collapsing at unexpected moments. These outbreaks ended, for most of us, at the end of the second month. But we now had time to think; the fastened mantle of our war memories slowly began to open. We resorted to more violence to avoid summoning thoughts of our recent lives.  Whenever I turned on the faucet, all I could see was blood gushing out. I would stare at it until it looked like water before drinking or taking a shower. Boys sometimes ran out of the hall screaming, ''The rebels are coming.'' Other times, the younger ones sat weeping and telling us that nearby rocks were their dead families.  It took several months before I began to relearn how to sleep without the aid of medicine. But even when I was finally able to fall asleep, I would start awake less than an hour later. I would dream that a faceless gunman had tied me up and begun to slit my throat with the zigzag edge of his bayonet. I would feel the pain that the knife inflicted as the man sawed my neck. I'd wake up sweating and throwing punches in the air. I would run outside to the middle of the soccer field, sit on a stone and rock back and forth, my arms wrapped around my legs. I would try desperately to think about my childhood, but I couldn't. The fighting memories seemed to have formed a barrier that I had to break in order to think about any moment before the war. On those mornings, I would feel one of the staff members wrap a blanket around me, saying: ''This isn't your fault, you know. It really isn't. You'll get through this.'' He would then pull me up and walk me back to the hall.  Past and Present  One day after I'd been in Benin Home for more than three months, I was sent to the minihospital for a checkup. The nurse on duty was named Esther. I had met her once before when I was sent to the minihospital after cutting my hand punching a window. Esther wore a white uniform and a white hat. Her white teeth contrasted with her dark, shiny skin, and when she smiled, her face glowed. She was tall and had big brown eyes that were kind and inviting. She must have been about 30, which I thought was too old.  That day, before Esther examined me, she gave me a present, a Walkman and a Run-DMC tape. I used to listen to rap music a lot before the war and loved it because of its poetic use of words. I put the headphones on and didn't mind being examined because the song had taken hold of me, and I listened closely to every word. But when she began examining my legs and saw the nasty scars on my left shin, she took my headphones off and asked, ''How did you get these scars?''  ''Bullet wounds,'' I casually replied.  Her face filled with sorrow, and her voice was shaking when she spoke: ''You have to tell me what happened so I can prescribe treatment.'' At first I was reluctant, but she said she would be able to treat me effectively only if I told her what happened, especially about how my bullet wounds were treated. So I told her the whole story not because I really wanted to but because I thought that if I told her some of the truth of my war years, she would be afraid of me and would cease asking questions. She listened attentively when I began to talk:  During the second dry season of my war years, we were low on food and ammunition. So as usual, we decided to attack another village, which was a three-day walk away. We left our base that evening, stopping once a day to eat, drink and take drugs. Each of us had two guns, one strapped to our backs, the other held in our hands. On the evening of the third day, the village was in sight.  Surrounding it, we waited for the lieutenant's command. As we lay in ambush, we began to realize that the place was empty. We were beginning to suspect that something was amiss when a shot was fired from behind us. It was clear now: we were being ambushed. We ended up in a fight that lasted more than 24 hours. We lost several men and boys. When we finally seemed to have captured the village, we began to look around for anything we could find. I was filling my backpack with ammunition from a hut when bullets began to rain on the village again. I was hit three times in my left shin. The first two bullets went in and out, and the last one stayed inside. I couldn't walk, so I lay on the ground and released an entire round of the magazine into the bush where the bullets had come from. I remember feeling a tingle in my spine, but I was too drugged to really feel the pain, even though my leg had begun to swell. The sergeant doctor in my squad dragged me into one of the houses and tried to remove the bullet. Each time he raised his hands from my wound, I saw my blood all over his fingers. My eyes began to grow heavy, and I fainted.  I do not know what happened, but when I woke the next day, I felt as if I had nails hammered into the bones of my shin and my veins were being chiseled. I felt so much pain that I was unable to cry out loud; tears just fell from my eyes. The ceiling of the thatched-roof house where I was lying on a bed was blurry. My eyes struggled to become familiar with my surroundings. The gunfire had ceased and the village was quiet, so I assumed that the attackers had been successfully driven away. I felt a brief relief for that, but the pain in my leg returned. I tucked my lips in, closed my heavy eyelids and held tight to the edges of the wooden bed. I heard the footsteps of people entering the house. They stood by my bed, and as soon as they began to speak, I recognized their voices.  ''The boy is suffering, and we have no medicine here to lessen his pain. Everything is at our former base.'' The sergeant doctor sighed and continued. ''It will take six days to send someone to get the medicine and return. He will die from the pain by then.''  ''We have to send him to the former base, then,'' I heard my lieutenant saying. ''We need those provisions from that base, anyway. Do all you can to make sure that the boy stays alive,'' he said and walked out. ''Yes, sir,'' the sergeant doctor said. I slowly opened my eyes, and this time I could see clearly. I looked at his sweaty face and tried to smile a little. After having heard what they said, I swore to myself that I would fight hard and do anything for my squad after my leg was healed.  ''We will get you some help,'' the sergeant doctor said gently, sitting by my bed and examining my leg. ''Just be strong, young man,''  ''Yes, sir,'' I said, and tried to raise my hand to salute him, but he tenderly brought my arm down.  Two soldiers came into the house, took me off the bed, placed me in a hammock and carried me outside. The treetops of the village began to spin around as they carried me out. The journey felt as if it took a month. I fainted and awoke many times, and each time I opened my eyes, it seemed as if the voices of those who carried me were fading into the distance.  Finally we got to the base, and the sergeant doctor, who had come along, went to work on me. I was injected with something. I was given cocaine, which I frantically demanded. The doctor started operating on me before the drugs took effect. The other soldiers held my hands and stuffed a cloth into my mouth. The doctor stuck a crooked-looking scissorslike tool inside my wound and fished for the bullet. I could feel the edge of the metal inside me. My entire body was racked with pain.  Just when I thought I had had enough, the doctor abruptly pulled the bullet out. A piercing pain rushed up my spine from my waist to the back of my neck. I fainted.  When I regained consciousness, it was the morning of the next day, and the drugs had kicked in. I reached my hands down to my leg and felt the bandage before I stood up and limped outside, where some soldiers and the sergeant were sitting. ''Where is my weapon?'' I asked them. The sergeant handed me my G3, and I began cleaning it. I shot a couple of rounds sitting against a wall, ignoring the bandage on my leg and everyone else. I smoked marijuana, ate and snorted cocaine and brown brown. That was all I did for a few days before we went back to the new base we had captured. When we left, we threw kerosene on the thatched-roof houses, lighted them with matches and fired a couple of RPGs into the walls. We always destroyed the bases we abandoned so that rebel squads wouldn't be able to use them. Two soldiers carried me in the hammock, but this time I had my gun, and I looked left and right as we traveled the forest path.  At the new base, I stayed put for three weeks. Then one day, we heard that a rebel group was on its way to attack our village. I tightened the bandage around my shin, picked up my gun and followed my squad to ambush them. We killed most of the attackers and captured a few whom we brought back to base. ''These are the men responsible for the bullet holes in your leg. It's time to make sure they never shoot at you or your comrades.'' The lieutenant pointed at the prisoners. I was not sure if one of the captives was the shooter, but any captive would do at that time. They were all lined up, six of them, with their hands tied. I shot them in their shins and watched them suffer for an entire day before finally deciding to shoot them in the head so that they would stop crying. Before I shot each man, I looked at him and saw how his eyes gave up hope and steadied before I pulled the trigger. I found their somber eyes irritating.  When I finished telling Esther the story, she had tears in her eyes, and she couldn't decide whether to rub my head, a traditional gesture indicating that things would be well, or hug me. In the end she did neither but said: ''None of what happened was your fault. You were just a little boy, and anytime you want to tell me anything, I am here to listen.'' She stared at me, trying to catch my eye so she could assure me of what she had just said. I became angry and regretted that I had told someone, a civilian, about my experience. I hated the ''It is not your fault'' line that all the staff members said every time anyone spoke about the war.  I got up, and as I started walking out of the hospital, Esther said, ''I will arrange a full checkup for you.'' She paused and then continued: ''Let me keep the Walkman. You don't want the others to envy you and steal it. I will be here every day, so you can come and listen to it anytime.'' I threw the Walkman at her and left, putting my fingers in my ears so I couldn't hear her say, ''It is not your fault.''  After that, whenever Esther would see me around, she'd smile and ask me how I was doing. At first I detested her intrusions. But slowly I came to appreciate them, even looked forward to them. It was like this at the center; most boys found a staff member whom they eventually began to trust. Mine was Esther.  Over the next few months, I started to visit Esther occasionally at the minihospital, which was just across the dirt road from the dorm that I shared with more than 35 boys. During that time, Esther got me to tell her some of my dreams. She would just listen and sit quietly with me. If she wanted to say anything, she would first ask, ''Would you like me to say something about your dream?'' Mostly I would say no and ask for the Walkman.  One day Esther gave me a Bob Marley tape and a really nice notebook and pen and suggested that I use them to write the lyrics of the songs and that we could learn them together. After that I visited Esther at the minihospital every day, to show her what I had written. I would sing her the parts of songs I had memorized. Memorizing lyrics left me little time to think about what happened in the war. As I grew comfortable with Esther, I talked to her mainly about Bob Marley's lyrics and Run-DMC's too. She mostly listened.  One night, close to my fifth month at the center, I fell asleep while reading the lyrics of a song. I startled awake after having a dream that involved lots of people stabbing and shooting one another, and I felt all their pain. The room I stood in filled with their blood. In the dream, I then went outside to sit at dinner with my father, mother and two brothers. They didn't seem to notice that I was covered with blood.  It was the first time I dreamed of my family since I started running away from the war. The next afternoon I went to see Esther, and she could tell that something was bothering me. ''Do you want to lie down?'' she asked, almost whispering.  ''I had this dream last night,'' I said looking away. ''I don't know what to make of it.''  She came and sat next to me and asked, ''Would you like to tell me about it?'' I didn't reply.  ''Or just talk about it out loud and pretend I am not here. I won't say anything. Only if you ask me.'' She sat quietly beside me. The quietness lasted for a while, and for some reason I began to tell her my dream.  At first she just listened to me, and then gradually she started asking questions to make me talk about the lives I had lived before and during the war. ''None of these things are your fault,'' she said, as she had repeated sternly at the end of every conversation. Even though I had heard that phrase from every staff member -- and had always hated it -- I began that day to believe it. That didn't make me immune to the guilt that I felt for what I had done. But it somehow lightened my burdensome memories and gave me strength to think about things. The more I spoke about my experiences to Esther, the more I began to cringe at the gruesome details, even though I didn't let her know that. I still didn't completely trust her. I only liked talking to her because I felt that she didn't judge me for what I had been a part of; she looked at me with the inviting eyes and welcoming smile that said I was still a child.  One day during my fifth month at Benin Home, I was sitting on a rock behind the classrooms when Esther came by. She sat next to me without uttering a word. She had my lyrics notebook in her hand. ''I feel as if there is nothing left for me to be alive for,'' I said slowly. ''I have no family, it is just me. No one will be able to tell stories about my childhood.'' I sniffled a bit.  Esther put her arms around me and pulled me closer to her. She shook me to get my full attention before she started. ''Think of me as your family, your sister.''  ''But I didn't have a sister,'' I replied.  ''Well, now you do,'' she said. ''You see, this is the beauty of starting a new family. You can have different kinds of family members.'' She looked at me directly, waiting for me to say something.  ''O.K., you can be my sister -- temporarily.'' I emphasized the last word.  ''That is fine with me. So will you come to see your temporary sister tomorrow, please?'' She covered her face as if she would be sad if I said no.  ''O.K., O.K., no need to be sad,'' I said, and we both laughed a bit.  Rejoining the Civilian World  Soon after, a group of visitors from the European Union, the United Nations, Unicef and several NGOs arrived at the center in a convoy of cars. At the request of the staff, we boys had prepared a talent show for them. I read a monologue from ''Julius Caesar'' and performed a short hip-hop play about the redemption of a former child soldier that I had written with Esther's encouragement. After that event, the head of the center asked me to be the spokesman for Benin Home and to speak about my experiences.  I was at the beginning of my seventh month at Benin Home when one of the field agents, Leslie, came to tell me that he was responsible for ''repatriating'' me -- the term used to describe the process of reuniting ex-child soldiers with their former communities. My family was dead, but I knew that my father had a brother whom I had never met who lived somewhere in Freetown. Leslie said he would try to find him, and if he couldn't, he'd find me a foster family to live with.  One Saturday afternoon about two weeks later, as I chatted with Esther at the minihospital, Leslie walked in, smiling widely. ''What is the good news?'' Esther asked. Leslie examined my curious face, then walked back to the door and opened it. A tall man walked in.  ''This is your uncle,'' Leslie proudly announced.  The man walked over to where I was sitting. He bent over and embraced me long and hard. My arms hung loose at my sides.  What if he is just some man pretending to be my uncle? I thought. The man let go of me. He was crying, which is when I began to believe that he was really my family, because men in Sierra Leone rarely cried.  He crouched on his heels next to me and began: ''I am sorry I never came to see you all those years. I wish I had met you before today. But we can't go back now. We just have to start from here. I am sorry for your losses.'' He looked at Leslie and continued: ''After you are done here, you can come and live with me and my family. You are my son. I don't have much, but I will give you a place to sleep, food and my love.'' He put his arms around me.  No one had called me ''son'' in a very long time. I didn't know what to say. Everyone, it seemed, was waiting for my response. I turned to my uncle, smiled at him and said: ''Thank you for coming to see me. I really appreciate that you have offered me to stay with you. But I don't even know you.'' I put my head down.  ''As I said, we cannot go back,'' he replied, rubbing my head and laughing a little. ''But we can start from here. I am your family, and that is enough for us to begin liking each other.''  I got up and hugged my uncle, and he embraced me harder than he had the first time and kissed me on my forehead. We briefly stood in silence before he began to speak again. ''I will visit you every weekend. And if it is O.K., I would like you to come home with me at some point, to see where I live and to meet my wife and children -- your family.'' My uncle's voice trembled; he was trying to hold back sobs. He rubbed my head with one hand and shook Leslie's hand with the other.  As my uncle promised, he came to visit every weekend. We would take long walks together, and they gave me a chance to get to know him. He told me about what my father was like when he was a child, and I told him about my childhood. I needed to talk about those good times before the war. But the more I heard and talked about my father, the more I missed my mother and brothers too.  About a month or so later at Benin Home, Leslie told me it was time for me to go live with my uncle. I was happy, but I was also worried about living with a family. I had been on my own for years and had taken care of myself without any guidance from anyone. If I distanced myself from the family, I was afraid that I might look ungrateful to my uncle, who didn't have to take me in; I was worried about what would happen when my nightmares took hold of me. How was I going to explain my sadness, which I was unable to hide when it took over my face, to my new family, especially the children?  I lay in my bed night after night staring at the ceiling and thinking, Why have I survived the war? Why was I the last person in my immediate family to be alive? I went to see Esther every day, though, and would say hello, ask how she was and then get lost in my own head thinking about what life was going to be like after the center. At night, I sat quietly on the veranda with my friends. I wouldn't notice when they left the bench that we all sat on.  When the day of my repatriation finally came, I walked to the minihospital building where I was to wait, my heart beating very fast. My friends Alhaji and Mambu and a boy named Mohamed were sitting on the front steps, and Esther emerged, smiling. Leslie sat in a nearby van waiting to take me to my new home.  ''I have to go,'' I said to everyone, my voice shaking. I extended my hand to Mohamed, but instead of shaking it, he leapt up and hugged me. Mambu embraced me while Mohamed was still holding me. He squeezed me hard, as if he knew it was goodbye forever. (After I left the center, Mambu's family refused to take him in, and he ended up back on the front lines.) At the end of the hug, Alhaji shook hands with me. We squeezed each other's hands and stared into each other's eyes, remembering all that we had been through. I never saw him again, since he continually moved from one foster home to another. Esther stepped forward, her eyes watery. She hugged me tighter than she ever had. I didn't return her hug very well, as I was busy trying to hold back my tears. After she let go, she gave me a piece of paper. ''This is my address,'' she said. ''Come by anytime.''  I went to Esther's home several weeks after that. But my timing wasn't good. She was on her way to work. She hugged me, and this time I squeezed back; this made her laugh after we stood apart. She looked me straight in the eyes. ''Come and see me next weekend so we can have more time to catch up, O.K.?'' she said. She was wearing her white uniform and was on her way to take on other traumatized children. It must be tough living with so many war stories. I was living with just one, mine, and it was difficult. Why does she do it? Why do they all do it? I thought as we went our separate ways. It was the last time I saw her. I loved her but never told her.

            "fulltext": "The two men first saw the baby from across the Bronx street, dangling from a fire escape four stories above the sidewalk. His grip was growing weaker by the second. The two men saw only one choice: run over and try to catch him.  They positioned themselves below, arms out. The little boy fell. He glanced off a branch of a tree that was brushing against the fire escape. Then he bounced off the chest of one of the men, who was knocked off balance and could not grab him.  But he landed safely in the arms of the other man, who managed to hold on tight.  And so yesterday, the two men -- longtime friends who had been looking over a used Honda that one was thinking of selling and the other was thinking of buying -- became the second and third good Samaritans of the new year, not even a week old. The rescue came two days after another New Yorker flung himself onto the subway tracks to save a 20-year-old film student who had fallen from the platform.  ''This is a week of heroes here in New York,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said later yesterday.  The two men -- Julio Gonzalez, 43, a mechanic who lives in the neighborhood, and Pedro Nevarez, 40, of Corona, Queens -- insisted that they had just done the obvious thing. As Mr. Nevarez, who has a 19-year-old foster son, put it: ''I'm not a hero. I did what any other father would do. When you're a father, you would do this whether it's your child or not.''  By then, a crowd of reporters and residents of the East Tremont neighborhood was swirling around them, and someone said, ''If you're not a hero, how about an angel without wings?''  Mr. Nevarez simply smiled. Mr. Gonzalez said, ''I feel I did something good.''  The baby, identified by the police as Timothy Addo, 3, was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was treated for minor scrapes and was released, a hospital spokesman said.  Before long, a man who said he was Timothy's great-uncle returned from the hospital to the apartment building at 2105 Daly Avenue, near East 180th Street, and showed the crowd a photograph of Timothy after his tumble, taken with a cellphone. The boy had what appeared to be a bandage on his head, but looked as if he was enjoying the attention. The police said that Timothy had been in his baby sitter's apartment on the top floor of the five-story building, and that there were no window guards. He crawled onto a radiator and from there, onto the fire escape, they said.  Last night at the 48th Precinct station house, the police were questioning the baby sitter, identified by law enforcement officials as Carol Baldwin, 50. It was not clear if any charges would be filed against her.  Ricky Serra, 31, said his daughter Alesha, 1 1/2, was also in Ms. Baldwin's apartment when Timothy climbed out the window. Ms. Baldwin also watches Mr. Serra's 4-year-old daughter, Adriana, after school. He said he would not send the girls back to her.  ''That could have been my baby,'' he said, referring to Timothy. But he added that Ms. Baldwin could not have foreseen that Timothy would play with the window.  Timothy's mother, Katrina Cosme, 26, was at work when the boy clambered out the window. Going step by step on the fire escape, he managed to work his way down one floor as passers-by below took notice.  Some screamed for help. Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez sprang into action, dashing toward the fire escape even though Mr. Gonzalez was not sure that the little object on the fire escape was a child. ''I thought it was a toy or something,'' he said later.  At first, he told Mr. Nevarez to run inside the building and pull the child back in. But the door was locked. Mr. Gonzalez realized that there was no time, and called his friend back. Mr. Nevarez said he tried to grab the bottom rung of the fire escape, hoping to climb up and carry the baby into the building. But the fire escape was too far off the ground.  They took their places under the fire escape just as Timothy lost his grip. Mr. Nevarez said Mr. Gonzalez told him: ''Stay right next to me. We're not going to let him hit the floor.''  First, the boy bounced off Mr. Nevarez. He said Timothy knocked the wind out of him, and also knocked him down.  Mr. Gonzalez then realized that it was up to him. ''I just hoped and prayed that I would be able to catch him,'' he said.  He did. ''He came down hard,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''He only weighed 45 pounds, but it felt like he weighed more than a hundred.'' They wrapped him in Mr. Nevarez's jacket and waited for help to arrive.  A neighbor, Migdalia Melendez, 43, said that Ms. Baldwin, the baby sitter, was standing behind the ambulance as the paramedics closed the doors, and that Timothy reached for her. Ms. Melendez said Ms. Baldwin put her arms around Timothy and said, ''I was only in the bathroom for a second.''  Ms. Melendez said she had been in her living room on the second floor when she heard people screaming and saw Timothy on the fire escape. She ran outside, as did her husband, Luis.  ''Don't blame the baby sitter,'' he said. ''She's a good woman.''  Another neighbor, Kyiesha Johnson, 19, said that she had known Ms. Baldwin from childhood and that Ms. Baldwin had looked after children in the building for years. If parents had to go to the store, Ms. Johnson said, the baby sitter kept tabs on their children.  ''She always tended to the kids perfect,'' Ms. Johnson said.  Timothy's mother, Ms. Cosme, arrived at the building a couple of hours after the excitement. She hugged Mr. Gonzalez and cut through the crowd. Last night, she told television reporters that she was grateful.  After the police arrived, Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez gave each other a high-five. That was when Mr. Nevarez realized that his hand was sore from landing on it when he was knocked down. His chest also felt sore. But he decided that he did not need medical help.  He and Mr. Gonzalez have known each other since they were 9 and 6, respectively, Mr. Nevarez said. They grew up on 174th Street in the Mount Eden section of the Bronx and have kept in close touch over the years.  ''We were in the right place at the right time,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''If we hadn't been there, we'd be talking about how the kid across the street fell out of the house and died.''",

            "fulltext": "LYNN BIEDERMAN, 44, says this about her mother: ''Had we not been mother and daughter, our paths would never cross.''  Ms. Biederman lives in a woodsy part of northern Westchester County, in a big house full of comfy, country-style furniture. Though she has a full life with her husband of 20 years and their two teenagers, and her work as a children's book writer and part-time librarian, she loves to slack off, pad around the house, eat in, sleep late. ''I would do anything to stay in bed, in a room as dark as a cave, for as long as possible,'' she says.  Her mother, Judith West Edelman, a wealthy businesswoman who refuses to give her age (''If I have to tell you, the story's off''), lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 40th-floor apartment with a spectacular view of the East River, rooms full of spare modern furniture and lots of unshaded windows that let the light pour in at dawn -- which is when she gets up seven mornings a week to work out at her gym.  The daughter, who's in fine shape (5 feet 3 inches, 112 pounds), once made the mistake of using her mother's personal trainer. ''I was like, 'Lou, why you giving me so much weight?' He says: 'What do you mean? Your mother does more reps at a higher weight and she never complains.' ''  The daughter seeks to avoid conflict. The mother relishes a fight. (She interrupted our interview to take a call about a woman she is battling in her co-op over an allegedly oversized dog.)  The daughter prefers quiet getaways and hates the Hamptons. The mother likes fancy restaurants, has a big house in the Hamptons and loves the scene.  The daughter is a Democrat, the mother a Republican.  The daughter served me home-baked vanilla cake warm from the oven and homemade cappuccino; the mother's uniformed maid served herbal tea from tea bags and low-fat cookies from the health food store.  The mother is punctual and has no time for fiddle-faddle; the daughter's constantly late because she fiddle-faddles. One of the mother's favorite sayings is, ''Fast walker, fast thinker.'' One of the daughter's is, ''What's the rush, Mom?''  The daughter believes her children are entitled to an explanation. The mother believes her own two children and her four grandchildren should not be overindulged. One of the mother's quippy sayings to silence children: ''Why? Because it's a letter in the alphabet.''  The daughter works at home. She knows her 14-year-old daughter's taste in food, clothes and books and loves shopping for her.  The mother works in an office -- once an assistant to the late Milton Petrie, the renowned women's clothing retailer, she is now president of Westco, her retail fixture business. The mother was too busy working to go with the daughter to pick out a wedding dress and sent her mother-in-law, the grandmother.  For years the mother and daughter had a guarded relationship. Many of the daughter's best friends are women who aren't close with their mothers.  The mother was too consumed by work to make women friends. ''I liked to talk business, and not many women did,'' she says. ''Even as a kid, I was a loner. I began to see myself as not friendly or having social skills. I'd say, 'So what, I make a million dollars a year.' ''  But in the last few years, things changed between mother and daughter. They grew close. There was no epiphany, they agree. The mother's quippy saying for this is: ''I suppose it's an accumulation of two-way streets.'' Each woman realized she'd fallen into the same trap.  ''I strove to be the opposite of my mother,'' the daughter says.  And the mother? ''I grew up hungry to be different from my mother.''  Seeing the problem helped break the cycle.  The mother grew up poor in Dallas. She says her father, a traveling salesman, was a ''brutal'' bully. ''I saw my mother being pushed around. I myself was. My mother, poor thing -- any friends she had were losers in life. So I had to figure out for myself what kind of woman I wanted to be. No one was going to push me around. I saw very quickly a woman couldn't have a voice without economic independence.'' Her first glimpse of what she wanted came during an after-school job at a Dallas department store. ''Those Neiman Marcus women, that was the life I wanted. It stoked the fire.''  Even though her husband, Sanford Edelman, is a successful businessman, she has never lost her fear of being dependent and has never slowed in her career. She continues to work when most her age would retire. This is how she explains her unrelenting morning workouts: ''A pretty woman has a better chance in business. I used anything I had at my disposal to get the job done.''  When she worked with Milton Petrie (estimated at his death in 1994 to be worth nearly a billion dollars), she says: ''My viewpoint consisted of myself as a career success. It never occurred to me I could ask to get out early for my kids. Having my mother-in-law go for the wedding dress with Lynn worked for me. I realize now it's a pretty narrow way to live.  ''If you never had a fur coat, you never had a two-carat diamond or made $100,000, it seems like a big deal.''  What changed? ''Once you get those things, it's not a big deal. I didn't have a good relationship with my mother. I didn't want to die feeling I didn't have a good relationship with my children. I didn't want to perpetuate a legacy. Where does it stop?''  For a while, the daughter says, she wouldn't let her mother back in: ''She saw I had something with my children. She'd say, 'I probably wasn't as great a mother as you' and I'd let it hang there.''  And then, several years ago, the daughter began writing a novel for young adults and realized the mother character she'd created -- nicknamed the Captain -- was too harsh to be believable. As she rounded out the character, she grew to have empathy for her mother's hard life.  They disagree about who reached out first. ''I threw the baton out, and she grabbed it,'' the daughter says.  Says the mother: ''I worked on being a more accepting mother. If I want to say something, I let it go a day or two before bringing it up. Like negotiating in business.''  Over Christmas, the two families went for a week to Buenos Aires to celebrate the mother's secret milestone birthday. ''The day after we flew back, Mom was in the gym at 7,'' the daughter says. ''I couldn't move.'' Asked what she loves about her mother, she says: ''It took a lot of guts for my mom to change. There's not a thing she wouldn't do for me.''  As for the mother, she has a quippy saying to cover her half: ''Sometimes the chicken can learn from the egg.''  PARENTING",

            "fulltext": "Overdue at a friend's house for dinner, I parked the minivan in the garage and urged my daughters to get out of the car and into the house, where my wife and the baby sitter were waiting. I reached into the back seat to help my 6-year-old, Gracie, expedite her exit. Which is when she hit me in the face with the beads.  These purple and gold Mardi Gras beads were just some of the plastic detritus that collects in the home of any family with small children: petrochemical dust bunnies that accumulate via Happy Meals and wishes granted by the cut-rate fairies my children find under rocks. Wherever they came from, they really hurt when they struck me across the bridge of the nose.  I took the beads from Gracie. ''Say goodbye,'' I said, and then, dear reader, I turned and hurled those beads as far as I could.  In the moment it took for the beads to arc through the air, up onto the roof of our neighbor's garage across the alley, they transformed from a worthless plastic gimcrack into my daughters' most prized possession, a priceless heirloom handed down through generations of hysterically overdramatic little girls.  Gracie howled as if I had just taken her to a kennel, allowed her to pick out a puppy and then stabbed it. Her 8-year-old sister, Rosie, whose hobby is acting out tragic Italianate operas of her own devising, clutched her notional bosom and wailed, and both girls ran screaming into the house ahead of me.  When I came in, the baby sitter was seated in the kitchen, glazed shock on her face. In the living room, my wife, Beth, embraced a weeping Rosie and Gracie, who told them, between sobs, of what I had done with their Very Favorite Beads They Loved So Very Much.  ''He . . . he . . . threw them. . . . ''  ''They're on the roof! They're on the roof!''  My wife looked at me with a merciless disdain. ''I'm sure he feels very bad about it,'' she said.  I decided to be a man about it. That is, I decided to correct the situation without ever admitting I had committed an error. I went down to the basement, retrieved our ladder and passed the still-goggling baby sitter on the way out the door.  The ladder came up to about three feet below the lip of the roof of the neighbors' garage. I easily hoisted myself up and retrieved the Holy Beads of Turin. Then I tried to come down. But seated on the edge of the roof, my dangling legs hung a good foot above the very top of the ladder. To get back onto the ladder, I'd have to slide off the roof, fall for a foot, hit the three-inch-wide top of the ladder and hope that it wouldn't topple over.  I stood up and went to each side of the garage roof to look for the pile of garbage bags filled with kapok that are always below any high precipice supporting a hero. No dice. There was a tree growing next to the garage. Sometimes heroes jump from high places onto trees, which bend willingly, and thus the heroes are able to descend to the ground. This tree looked prickly and sharp and just as high, frankly, as the roof.  It began to occur to me that I wasn't the hero.  I considered calling for help. If my wife and children came out, along with the baby sitter, any anger they felt would be immediately washed away by the flood of laughter and joy expressed at my humiliating plight. ''Papa's on the roof!'' Gracie would shout and clap her little hands together, and all would beam and grin until darkness inexorably fell.  Or: a neighbor answers my call -- perhaps even the neighbor who owned the garage. After hearing my abashed explanation, the neighbor would produce a taller ladder, and I would descend, and news of the incident would spread like ragweed throughout the neighborhood, and parents would jokingly tell their children to keep their fake plastic jewelry away from Mr. Sagal . . . and contemplating that, I realized that I would quite literally rather die, which is a striking thought to have at a moment when you're standing on a roof.  The Public Humiliation scenario was becoming more and more likely, as I stood there, visible for miles, the figurehead of the U.S.S. Moron. I sat down on the edge of the roof and, holding my breath, pushed off into space. My feet hit the ladder. It wobbled but did not fall. I climbed down, folded up the ladder and walked inside. The girls were still sobbing.  I handed Gracie the beads. ''There,'' I said. She sniffled but kept crying.  ''How did you get them?'' she asked.  ''I climbed up and got them. O.K.? I'm sorry I threw them on the roof. But you shouldn't have hit me with them.''  Beth and I walked out the door to go to our friend's house. As we left, I noticed that the beads had been dropped into the corner of the sofa. (They remained there for two months, until my wife found them while cleaning and threw them out.)  ''Sorry,'' I said to the baby sitter.  ''It happens,'' she said.  Does it? On the drive over to our friend's house, I kept scanning the roof lines, looking for rage-crazed dads, holding plastic toys, looking for a way down.

            "fulltext": "THE evidence lay throughout the yard of a modest home on Burns Road. A jumble of driftwood in the corner of the pebbled driveway. A rock wall built without mortar. And, most tellingly, a stout cylindrical cairn, reminiscent of the mysterious one that appeared on a nearby beach around Christmas.  Shelter Island is a small community, especially in winter, when the swell of tourists and seasonal residents recedes. Those who remain know one another by name. Yet a sophisticated cairn was erected, almost six feet high, on the north side of the causeway that leads to Ram Island, and no one knew the builder's identity.  On Jan. 4, the local newspaper, the Shelter Island Reporter, featured a picture of the cairn, which is made of concentric layers of well-balanced stones that taper to a point at the top. Four driftwood posts run through it, creating a spiral pattern around the shaft, and the interior is filled with rocks. If you lean on the cairn, it does not budge.  ''There's so many possibilities,'' Karen Boltax said in her Boltax Gallery last Sunday afternoon. ''There's a lot of artists here.''  She did not realize then that she knew the builder and would be a key in unraveling the mystery.  A piece of driftwood propped against a tuft of golden grass a few feet from the cairn provided the first substantial clue: ''Maya Emma'' was scrawled in charcoal.  ''I have a friend named Maya,'' said Lena Cordts, 11, who had gone to the beach that sunny Sunday with friends and their parents, Sarah Sherwood and Chris Mulligan of Shelter Island. ''She has a sister Emma, too,'' Lena told a reporter who had also stopped by.  Lena said Maya and Emma lived near St. Mary's Episcopal Church. A trip there found a house with driftwood, stones and a cairn on the property. Its residents were not home, but that was where Ms. Boltax came in. She knew the house, she said: Gary Buckner, a social studies teacher at Mattituck High School, his wife, Valerie Marvin, and two daughters, Maya and Emma, live there.  ''Val and Gary are very hip people,'' Ms. Boltax said. ''It wouldn't surprise me if they did the sculpture.''  It turns out that Mr. Buckner built it, and he feels uncomfortable calling it a sculpture.  ''I don't think of myself as an artist,'' he said on Monday. ''I call it a cairn.''  He built the cairn from materials he found on the beach and worked on it each weekend in December, saying he put in a few meditative hours just after sunrise and sometimes at ''the setting of the day.'' He showed the structure only to family and friends visiting from Brooklyn on Christmas. He had hoped to remain anonymous to the rest of the island and said he did not realize his daughters had left their names behind.  Although several admirers likened the cairn to work by the environmental sculptor Andy Goldsworthy, Mr. Buckner said he did not intend to create a piece of art. It was homage, he said, to its location, a peaceful ribbon of shore where the water slides smoothly inland and cedar trees thrive in the sandy soil.  ''I thought it was appropriate to leave an offering to a place where we all go,'' he said. ''We go when we're angry and confused. We go for peace, for an answer, for understanding. We go there and then we leave, and that's it. I wanted to leave something somewhat permanent.''  Acknowledging that the cairn may one day be destroyed by nature or human hand, Mr. Buckner said: ''I wanted it to be an observer of time and change. Even in its destruction, that's time itself.''  Already, the cairn has changed. Visitors have stuck pieces of curled seashell and a long brown feather between the outer stones.  ''I'm totally drawn,'' Ms. Sherwood said as she gazed at the cairn. ''It's a strangely primitive emotional thing.''  She said she and her family had built cairns in their travels around the world. ''But I think the level of our sophistication will now increase,'' she said.  Indeed, 50 yards down the beach, her husband and children were busy piling rocks.  MYSTERY",

            "fulltext": "LYNN BIEDERMAN, 44, says this about her mother: ''Had we not been mother and daughter, our paths would never cross.''  Ms. Biederman lives in a woodsy part of northern Westchester County, in a big house full of comfy, country-style furniture. Though she has a full life with her husband of 20 years and their two teenagers, and her work as a children's book writer and part-time librarian, she loves to slack off, pad around the house, eat in, sleep late. ''I would do anything to stay in bed, in a room as dark as a cave, for as long as possible,'' she says.  Her mother, Judith West Edelman, a wealthy businesswoman who refuses to give her age (''If I have to tell you, the story's off''), lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 40th-floor apartment with a spectacular view of the East River, rooms full of spare modern furniture and lots of unshaded windows that let the light pour in at dawn -- which is when she gets up seven mornings a week to work out at her gym.  The daughter, who's in fine shape (5 feet 3 inches, 112 pounds), once made the mistake of using her mother's personal trainer. ''I was like, 'Lou, why you giving me so much weight?' He says: 'What do you mean? Your mother does more reps at a higher weight and she never complains.' ''  The daughter seeks to avoid conflict. The mother relishes a fight. (She interrupted our interview to take a call about a woman she is battling in her co-op over an allegedly oversized dog.)  The daughter prefers quiet getaways and hates the Hamptons. The mother likes fancy restaurants, has a big house in the Hamptons and loves the scene.  The daughter is a Democrat, the mother a Republican.  The daughter served me home-baked vanilla cake warm from the oven and homemade cappuccino; the mother's uniformed maid served herbal tea from tea bags and low-fat cookies from the health food store.  The mother is punctual and has no time for fiddle-faddle; the daughter's constantly late because she fiddle-faddles. One of the mother's favorite sayings is, ''Fast walker, fast thinker.'' One of the daughter's is, ''What's the rush, Mom?''  The daughter believes her children are entitled to an explanation. The mother believes her own two children and her four grandchildren should not be overindulged. One of the mother's quippy sayings to silence children: ''Why? Because it's a letter in the alphabet.''  The daughter works at home. She knows her 14-year-old daughter's taste in food, clothes and books and loves shopping for her.  The mother works in an office -- once an assistant to the late Milton Petrie, the renowned women's clothing retailer, she is now president of Westco, her retail fixture business. The mother was too busy working to go with the daughter to pick out a wedding dress and sent her mother-in-law, the grandmother.  For years the mother and daughter had a guarded relationship. Many of the daughter's best friends are women who aren't close with their mothers.  The mother was too consumed by work to make women friends. ''I liked to talk business, and not many women did,'' she says. ''Even as a kid, I was a loner. I began to see myself as not friendly or having social skills. I'd say, 'So what, I make a million dollars a year.' ''  But in the last few years, things changed between mother and daughter. They grew close. There was no epiphany, they agree. The mother's quippy saying for this is: ''I suppose it's an accumulation of two-way streets.'' Each woman realized she'd fallen into the same trap.  ''I strove to be the opposite of my mother,'' the daughter says.  And the mother? ''I grew up hungry to be different from my mother.''  Seeing the problem helped break the cycle.  The mother grew up poor in Dallas. She says her father, a traveling salesman, was a ''brutal'' bully. ''I saw my mother being pushed around. I myself was. My mother, poor thing -- any friends she had were losers in life. So I had to figure out for myself what kind of woman I wanted to be. No one was going to push me around. I saw very quickly a woman couldn't have a voice without economic independence.'' Her first glimpse of what she wanted came during an after-school job at a Dallas department store. ''Those Neiman Marcus women, that was the life I wanted. It stoked the fire.''  Even though her husband, Sanford Edelman, is a successful businessman, she has never lost her fear of being dependent and has never slowed in her career. She continues to work when most her age would retire. This is how she explains her unrelenting morning workouts: ''A pretty woman has a better chance in business. I used anything I had at my disposal to get the job done.''  When she worked with Milton Petrie (estimated at his death in 1994 to be worth nearly a billion dollars), she says: ''My viewpoint consisted of myself as a career success. It never occurred to me I could ask to get out early for my kids. Having my mother-in-law go for the wedding dress with Lynn worked for me. I realize now it's a pretty narrow way to live.  ''If you never had a fur coat, you never had a two-carat diamond or made $100,000, it seems like a big deal.''  What changed? ''Once you get those things, it's not a big deal. I didn't have a good relationship with my mother. I didn't want to die feeling I didn't have a good relationship with my children. I didn't want to perpetuate a legacy. Where does it stop?''  For a while, the daughter says, she wouldn't let her mother back in: ''She saw I had something with my children. She'd say, 'I probably wasn't as great a mother as you' and I'd let it hang there.''  And then, several years ago, the daughter began writing a novel for young adults and realized the mother character she'd created -- nicknamed the Captain -- was too harsh to be believable. As she rounded out the character, she grew to have empathy for her mother's hard life.  They disagree about who reached out first. ''I threw the baton out, and she grabbed it,'' the daughter says.  Says the mother: ''I worked on being a more accepting mother. If I want to say something, I let it go a day or two before bringing it up. Like negotiating in business.''  Over Christmas, the two families went for a week to Buenos Aires to celebrate the mother's secret milestone birthday. ''The day after we flew back, Mom was in the gym at 7,'' the daughter says. ''I couldn't move.'' Asked what she loves about her mother, she says: ''It took a lot of guts for my mom to change. There's not a thing she wouldn't do for me.''  As for the mother, she has a quippy saying to cover her half: ''Sometimes the chicken can learn from the egg.''  PARENTING",

            "fulltext": "THE ways we think we are affecting our children as parents and the actual impact we have are two different matters. Already I see evidence of this with my four. My richest memories of their childhood and their richest memories are not the same memories. They'll say, ''Remember that time, Dad'' and I don't, even though I was there, and I'm in the story.  From a young age, they are editing our family's life through their filters.  I lived this with my own father. In several basic ways, he shaped me: He was a newspaperman who valued education and family. But the most vivid memories I have of my childhood, I know, are not the ones he would have selected. Those memories have pushed me to try and be a different sort of parent than he was.  One of the most central influences he had on me -- developing my voice as both a writer and parent -- came about in ways that he never would have guessed and that I myself did not recognize until well into my adult years.  As a young reporter, I was constantly in search of my writer's voice, since I'd been told all real writers -- as opposed to journalists -- had one. In the early going, this produced ludicrous results as I discovered my voice was exactly the same as whatever literary giant's I happened to be absorbed in that week. (Particularly deadly for newspaper readers was my Faulkner phase.)  By my third newspaper and my 30th birthday, I had given up; I'd resigned myself to being a journalist without a voice.  And then one night after work at The Miami Herald, I went out to Johnny Raffa's Lobo Lounge with a terrific editor, Doug Balz. After a few beers, Doug asked where my distinctive writing voice came from.  I was stunned. Someone thought I had a voice? This was the moment I'd been waiting for, except I had no clue what my distinctive voice was. I had to ask him.  He told me I had an ability to poke fun at people in my writing, to accurately portray their foibles and yet still convey my genuine affection for them.  And the moment he said it, I knew where it came from. My ''writer's voice'' was the mechanism I'd developed that let me live with my father and hold onto his love. The voice was so central to my being while growing up, it was inaudible to me.  My dad was a good, loving man, but difficult and troubled. On the street where we grew up, the houses were so close together every neighbor could hear the next neighbor's business. We knew who the drinkers were, who the adulterers were, who was out of work. Dad was none of these. He drank in moderation, came home to my mother and worked steadily as a newspaper copy editor -- seven days a week at one point, to put us through college.  But as the whole block had to know, Dad was a vicious screamer. He was floridly profane and verbally abusive, usually toward my mother, and it could go on, with rest breaks, for hours. Throughout high school, I did not bring home friends for fear my father would have one of his explosions.  It wasn't until after he died, in 1980, at the age of 65, that I got some insight into his rage. Piecing it together with family members, I guessed that my father suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mental illness that can compel people to obsessively repeat rituals. In some ways, this served my dad well. He was the slot man at The Boston Herald -- the final person to check stories before they were printed, to pore over every piece of copy to make sure no error got into the paper.  Today, this illness has become a part of mainstream culture. My father most likely had the same disorder as the amusing private investigator on the TV show ''Monk.''  However, if there were funny parts when I was growing up, I don't remember them. I do remember, as a boy, catching my father repeatedly washing his hands, then seeing him struggle to turn off the bathroom light with his elbow to avoid germs. It's not hard to imagine why he'd build up rage inside, having to deal daily with a humiliating disorder that he did not understand.  Somehow, in the course of my childhood, I found the voice to let him know he was behaving badly, to convey the message in a way that communicated my love and, at times, defused his rage. My mother used to say, ''Michael, you're the only one who can placate your father.'' I'd guess that what reached him as much as my words was a child's na\u00efve attempt to make things right.  He was so mercurial -- from cruel to remorseful and back -- that he forced us to feel deeply and often. He could launch into a screaming fit if the kid next door accidentally kicked a ball into our yard, and if I got up the courage to challenge him -- ''He's a good kid, Dad, what do you think, he did it on purpose, Dad? We do the same thing, Dad.'' -- he'd stomp upstairs. Then, just when everyone was drained and humiliated and hoping he'd never come down again, there were the footsteps on the stairs, and we braced for the next explosion. ''You boys want to take a ride and get some ice cream?'' he'd say on a good day.  Besides my writer's voice, he influenced my own parenting style, though not in the ways he would have guessed. That same voice I used on my dad I use on my kids to make sure they know how much I love them even as I'm grounding them. I also repeatedly remind my kids that their friends are welcome at our home. And I've always strived to avoid arguing with my wife in front of our children. I've sworn a silent oath never to do to my kids what my father did to me.  PARENTING E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com",

            "fulltext": "I'D met the happily married man several times, always at one of the parties Doug gave in his loft in TriBeCa, but we never got to know each other very well. He was alarmingly kind, and of course married, but for some reason, his happily married wife and I didn't remember each other. Could be because Doug's loft seems to be the size of a football field, and when you are in a space the size of a football field, you usually don't get to know the people on the other side unless you have a pair of binoculars.  Doug knew that for a variety of reasons, mostly having to do with lack of funds, my living situation had once again become unmanageable. I was moving out of the room where I was living in the West Village, which I could no longer pay for -- the unromantic aspect of being a writer -- and I had no idea where I was going. So, in September, when Doug went on location to direct a hundred-million-dollar movie, he offered me the keys to his loft for a few months.  By the time he got back, the idea was, my life would be sorted out. And in fact, I didn't feel too bad about moving in. I figured that I could check his mail, water his plants and generally manage things, even though he has a staff of people taking care of him even when he's not there.  The weekend that my cat, Boo, and I were to move in, I discovered that Doug had also given loft keys to the happily married man and the happily married woman, who, as it turned out, had a happy baby. It's inappropriate to be furious with somebody who's doing you a favor. But since I work at home, I worried that I'd never be able to get any work done, not to mention that the thought of a screaming baby, happy or not, terrified me.  In the scrambling for options, seven friends offered alternatives that involved couches, beds and futons. But Doug's two-story loft, with the vast open space below and gorgeous bedrooms above, seemed to be my safest bet, as I would have my own room and the happy family would have theirs.  Still, the first weekend was overwhelming. Forbes magazine had already listed TriBeCa as the 12th most expensive neighborhood in the country, which, as a friend pointed out, meant that TriBeCa had become the most expensive square mile in the city. Boutiques, designer shops and strollers were everywhere.  Yet more noticeable than the outside, I could see inside that the happily married man and the happily married woman were excessively kind to each other. Everyone in the happy family, which now included me, was treated with total respect and fairness, something I don't see a lot of. Even more unnerving was to discover they were equally kind to each other even when they thought I wasn't there.  The happy baby was 15 months old at the point we all moved in together, an enchanting and joyful child except when she screamed. The first time I heard her cry, the crying lasted 45 minutes. It didn't really last that long, but it seemed to. I was afraid that something might be wrong with her, but the next morning the happily married woman explained what was going on. ''You're not supposed to pick them up for the first 10 minutes,'' she explained. ''It's not good for them.''  Friends explained to me that this kind of child rearing is called the Ferber method, which thankfully didn't exist when I was growing up. The approach struck me as a bit harsh, both for the child and for me, but I accepted this as my fate. I knew what I was getting into.  After a while, you get used to the sound of a baby wailing, especially if you don't have to do anything about it. You go back to sleep, or you leave the house. Or you lie on your bed and simply absorb the sound. There were times I connected with her pain. Other times I felt a tinge of jealousy that she was allowed to express her emotions so openly while we adults are encouraged to suppress ours altogether.  No matter, the loft was filled with a peacefulness. I considered inviting friends over just so they could see the couple in action: opening the refrigerator with love, taking out the trash with love; good mornings and good nights with love. But I didn't want to exploit their happiness.  One afternoon, I noticed that the happily married woman's expression was not as vibrant as usual. When I asked her why she was down, she told me that the happily married man had found them a great apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, but when she had gone to look at the place, the landlord wouldn't let her in. I couldn't imagine why until she went on to explain, ''Because of the color of my skin.''  ''In Brooklyn?'' I demanded.  ''Yes, in Brooklyn,'' she replied.  What I haven't mentioned is that the happily married man is an attractive white male and the happily married woman is a stunning black female. She told me that this sort of thing happens about once a month. I was devastated for them.  Every once in a while, I gave Doug updates about how things are going in the loft, usually when he dropped by between trips from Toronto, Paris or Rome. On the last visit, I urged him to observe the happy couple closely. I told him that maybe we could learn from them, because one thing Doug and I have in common is that we believe in true love without actually having ever committed to it. Or at least our commitments thus far have been sporadic. We also discussed the Ferber method and concluded that maybe our problem is that we were picked up too much when we were babies.  Not too long ago, the happily married man and the happily married woman pulled me aside and told me that they had just had a fight. I replied that I didn't believe them because they were smiling. ''It's true,'' one of them insisted. ''We were in a fight, and in fact, we're still having it.'' As they continued to tell me about their minor skirmish, I knew they were just trying to make me feel better about my life, which of course didn't work.  The fear of moving in with the happy family turned out to be more frightening than the reality. They didn't stand in the way of getting my work done, and I didn't lose that much sleep. And if it weren't for the happy baby, I wouldn't know, for example, that there are 15 1/2 steps between the floors of Doug's loft.  One recent weekend, I packed my bags and left. Another friend who watches over me had helped me find a place to live above an Italian restaurant in the Village. Even though the landlord warned me about the ghost who lives in the building, I moved in anyway. I've never been afraid of ghosts, and after staying in Doug's loft, I'm not afraid of happiness anymore.

Who has ridden along New York's 656 miles of subway lines and not wondered: ''What if I fell to the tracks as a train came in? What would I do?''  And who has not thought: ''What if someone else fell? Would I jump to the rescue?''  Wesley Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker and Navy veteran, faced both those questions in a flashing instant yesterday, and got his answers almost as quickly.  Mr. Autrey was waiting for the downtown local at 137th Street and Broadway in Manhattan around 12:45 p.m. He was taking his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, home before work.  Nearby, a man collapsed, his body convulsing. Mr. Autrey and two women rushed to help, he said. The man, Cameron Hollopeter, 20, managed to get up, but then stumbled to the platform edge and fell to the tracks, between the two rails.  The headlights of the No. 1 train appeared. ''I had to make a split decision,'' Mr. Autrey said.  So he made one, and leapt.  Mr. Autrey lay on Mr. Hollopeter, his heart pounding, pressing him down in a space roughly a foot deep. The train's brakes screeched, but it could not stop in time.  Five cars rolled overhead before the train stopped, the cars passing inches from his head, smudging his blue knit cap with grease. Mr. Autrey heard onlookers' screams. ''We're O.K. down here,'' he yelled, ''but I've got two daughters up there. Let them know their father's O.K.'' He heard cries of wonder, and applause.  Power was cut, and workers got them out. Mr. Hollopeter, a student at the New York Film Academy, was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He had only bumps and bruises, said his grandfather, Jeff Friedman. The police said it appeared that Mr. Hollopeter had suffered a seizure.  Mr. Autrey refused medical help, because, he said, nothing was wrong. He did visit Mr. Hollopeter in the hospital before heading to his night shift. ''I don't feel like I did something spectacular; I just saw someone who needed help,'' Mr. Autrey said. ''I did what I felt was right.''",

            "fulltext": "Wesley Autrey teetered back and forth on the edge of a subway platform yesterday, re-enacting how he dived onto the tracks of a southbound No. 1 train in Manhattan on Tuesday to save another man's life.  A little boy with black hair and a bowl cut followed each of his moves. Other passers-by at the 137th Street station let loose the occasional hurrah or hand clap. Still others riffled through newspapers, which featured Mr. Autrey's picture and headlines like ''Subway Superman.''  A few subway stops away, at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center on 114th street near Amsterdam Avenue, Cameron Hollopeter underwent a second day of medical evaluation. Police said Mr. Hollopeter, a first-year film student at the New York Film Academy, had suffered a seizure, which sent him convulsing off the platform and onto the tracks, where Mr. Autrey held him down as the train rumbled just inches above them.  Moments after the train came to a halt, Mr. Autrey recounted yesterday, Mr. Hollopeter asked if he was dead. ''I said, 'You are very much alive, but if you move you'll kill the both of us.' '' Both men emerged from the episode with little more than bruises, but Mr. Autrey also emerged a star.  Mr. Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker, said he knew something was different when he showed up for work later on Tuesday. His boss, he said, bought him lunch -- a ham-and-cheese hero -- and later told him to take yesterday off.  Then yesterday morning, as he walked to his mother's apartment in Harlem, ''a stranger came up and put $10 in my hand,'' he said. ''People in my neighborhood were like, 'Yo, I know this guy.' ''  Once at his mother's apartment, he held interviews in the living room with some of the national morning news programs.  After that, it was back to the scene, where he recounted Mr. Hollopeter's backward tumble off the platform and into the path of the oncoming train.  Throughout the day, Mr. Autrey's sister, Linda, 48, played the role of administrative assistant, logging invitations for the talk-show circuit, including requests from the David Letterman, Charlie Rose and Ellen DeGeneres shows. Phone calls from well-wishers came pouring in, including one from the mayor's office. Mr. Autrey said he had been offered cash, trips and scholarships for his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, who watched as he dived to the trackbed.  ''Donald Trump's got a check waiting on me,'' he said. ''They offered to mail it; I said, 'No, I'd like to meet the Donald, so I can say, Yo, you're fired.' ''  By the end of the day, the president of the New York Film Academy, Jerry Sherlock, had personally handed him a $5,000 check.  Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Autrey and Mr. Hollopeter met again. The meeting was closed to reporters, but afterward Mr. Autrey described how he stepped into Mr. Hollopeter's hospital room, where they shared a few laughs as Mr. Hollopeter's father stood by with tears in his eyes.  Shortly after 4 p.m., Mr. Autrey walked out of the hospital with Mr. Hollopeter's father, Larry, and into a throng of more than 30 reporters and camera operators who jammed microphones into their faces.  ''This is Cameron's father,'' Mr. Autrey began. ''He's a very, very, nice, nice man and, you know, I'm not used to this press,'' he said, as reporters shouted at them to lean closer to the microphones and camera shutters popped like party favors.  Mr. Hollopeter was nervous, his hands shaking, as he read from handwritten notes.  ''Mr. Autrey's instinctive and unselfish act ---- '' Mr. Hollopeter said, hesitating, as reporters inched closer. ''There are no words to properly express our gratitude and feelings for his actions. Cameron is recovering and stable. Now he needs his rest, and our wishes are that you respect his privacy. May God's blessings be with Mr. Autrey and his family.''  The teary father then slipped back into the hospital, apparently overcome with emotion.  ''Me and the families are trying to make some plans so his family can meet my family and we can have a little gathering,'' Mr. Autrey said, before breaking into a hearty laugh. ''Without the media!''  Mr. Autrey was asked to reflect on the experience.  ''Maybe I was in the right place at the right time, and good things happen for good people,'' Mr. Autrey said.  Then he hopped into his brother-in-law's tan Toyota Corolla. As the car pulled away, Mr. Autrey had some final words: ''All New Yorkers! If you see somebody in distress, go for it!''",

            "fulltext": "THE ways we think we are affecting our children as parents and the actual impact we have are two different matters. Already I see evidence of this with my four. My richest memories of their childhood and their richest memories are not the same memories. They'll say, ''Remember that time, Dad'' and I don't, even though I was there, and I'm in the story.  From a young age, they are editing our family's life through their filters.  I lived this with my own father. In several basic ways, he shaped me: He was a newspaperman who valued education and family. But the most vivid memories I have of my childhood, I know, are not the ones he would have selected. Those memories have pushed me to try and be a different sort of parent than he was.  One of the most central influences he had on me -- developing my voice as both a writer and parent -- came about in ways that he never would have guessed and that I myself did not recognize until well into my adult years.  As a young reporter, I was constantly in search of my writer's voice, since I'd been told all real writers -- as opposed to journalists -- had one. In the early going, this produced ludicrous results as I discovered my voice was exactly the same as whatever literary giant's I happened to be absorbed in that week. (Particularly deadly for newspaper readers was my Faulkner phase.)  By my third newspaper and my 30th birthday, I had given up; I'd resigned myself to being a journalist without a voice.  And then one night after work at The Miami Herald, I went out to Johnny Raffa's Lobo Lounge with a terrific editor, Doug Balz. After a few beers, Doug asked where my distinctive writing voice came from.  I was stunned. Someone thought I had a voice? This was the moment I'd been waiting for, except I had no clue what my distinctive voice was. I had to ask him.  He told me I had an ability to poke fun at people in my writing, to accurately portray their foibles and yet still convey my genuine affection for them.  And the moment he said it, I knew where it came from. My ''writer's voice'' was the mechanism I'd developed that let me live with my father and hold onto his love. The voice was so central to my being while growing up, it was inaudible to me.  My dad was a good, loving man, but difficult and troubled. On the street where we grew up, the houses were so close together every neighbor could hear the next neighbor's business. We knew who the drinkers were, who the adulterers were, who was out of work. Dad was none of these. He drank in moderation, came home to my mother and worked steadily as a newspaper copy editor -- seven days a week at one point, to put us through college.  But as the whole block had to know, Dad was a vicious screamer. He was floridly profane and verbally abusive, usually toward my mother, and it could go on, with rest breaks, for hours. Throughout high school, I did not bring home friends for fear my father would have one of his explosions.  It wasn't until after he died, in 1980, at the age of 65, that I got some insight into his rage. Piecing it together with family members, I guessed that my father suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mental illness that can compel people to obsessively repeat rituals. In some ways, this served my dad well. He was the slot man at The Boston Herald -- the final person to check stories before they were printed, to pore over every piece of copy to make sure no error got into the paper.  Today, this illness has become a part of mainstream culture. My father most likely had the same disorder as the amusing private investigator on the TV show ''Monk.''  However, if there were funny parts when I was growing up, I don't remember them. I do remember, as a boy, catching my father repeatedly washing his hands, then seeing him struggle to turn off the bathroom light with his elbow to avoid germs. It's not hard to imagine why he'd build up rage inside, having to deal daily with a humiliating disorder that he did not understand.  Somehow, in the course of my childhood, I found the voice to let him know he was behaving badly, to convey the message in a way that communicated my love and, at times, defused his rage. My mother used to say, ''Michael, you're the only one who can placate your father.'' I'd guess that what reached him as much as my words was a child's na\u00efve attempt to make things right.  He was so mercurial -- from cruel to remorseful and back -- that he forced us to feel deeply and often. He could launch into a screaming fit if the kid next door accidentally kicked a ball into our yard, and if I got up the courage to challenge him -- ''He's a good kid, Dad, what do you think, he did it on purpose, Dad? We do the same thing, Dad.'' -- he'd stomp upstairs. Then, just when everyone was drained and humiliated and hoping he'd never come down again, there were the footsteps on the stairs, and we braced for the next explosion. ''You boys want to take a ride and get some ice cream?'' he'd say on a good day.  Besides my writer's voice, he influenced my own parenting style, though not in the ways he would have guessed. That same voice I used on my dad I use on my kids to make sure they know how much I love them even as I'm grounding them. I also repeatedly remind my kids that their friends are welcome at our home. And I've always strived to avoid arguing with my wife in front of our children. I've sworn a silent oath never to do to my kids what my father did to me.  PARENTING E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com",

            "fulltext": "Barbaro was said to be resting comfortably last night after his months of slow, smooth recovery were interrupted by 36 hours of pain caused by damaged tissue in his left hind hoof.  The colt's owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson, and the veterinarian who cared for him while he was racing, Dr. Kathleen Anderson, said yesterday that they remained optimistic that Barbaro would fully recover. They indicated that this latest setback, part of a long and harrowing convalescence, was not as serious as previous episodes.  Each of them visited Barbaro and said the colt's condition was improving as the day went on. Anderson said Barbaro was eating well and resting quietly in his stall in the intensive care unit of the George D. Widener Hospital for Large Animals in Kennett Square, Pa., when she left him in the late afternoon.  ''I do not think it as dire as it was in July,'' Anderson said in a telephone interview.  That was a reference to the period when laminitis, an often-fatal disease caused by uneven weight distribution in the limbs, first afflicted Barbaro.  ''It's a step back, a disappointment and a shock because we thought we were over the hump,'' Anderson said. ''But it's not insurmountable.''  Veterinarians removed the damaged tissue Tuesday night, and Barbaro was listed in stable condition. The situation, however, was described as a ''significant setback'' to his efforts to properly regrow a hoof that was destroyed by laminitis, according to a statement released by the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center in Kennett Square.  Barbaro, last year's Kentucky Derby winner, has been recovering at the center since he shattered his right hind leg in the opening yards of the Preakness Stakes on May 20. In fact, his recovery was going so well that the Jacksons were making plans to move him to a facility or farm in Kentucky before winter set in.  Roy Jackson said the colt had shown discomfort in the past 36 hours primarily from a cast put on last week that was intended to help re-align a bone in Barbaro's left hind hoof. The cast was removed Tuesday night. Some new separation of a portion of his hoof was found, and the tissue was removed.  ''There was an area of his hoof where he was bothered by the cast, and by getting that cast off he has already shown some relief,'' Jackson said in a telephone interview yesterday afternoon after visiting Barbaro. ''I just left him and he was eating away at the hay, standing and putting weight on it better. The way it was explained to me was, the tissue removed was like getting an in-grown toenail removed.''  While the original fracture in Barbaro's right hind leg appears to be healing well, veterinarians have always said they were more concerned about the severe laminitis that prompted the removal of 80 percent of the colt's left hoof.  Until Tuesday, Barbaro's convalescence had been going well enough for the Jacksons and the colt's surgeon, Dr. Dean Richardson, to consider discharging him from the hospital for a more pastoral environment on a farm.  Richardson did not respond to requests for an interview yesterday.  It takes a year for a horse to regrow a hoof, Anderson said, and Barbaro was six months into the process and doing very well, except for a portion of his inside heel. Still, when Anderson visited last week, she said the colt was at the top of his form and looked ready to take flight in the Kentucky bluegrass.  ''He was looking ready and forward to big green pasture -- we all wanted it for him,'' she said. ''This sets things back, but not all the way to six months ago.'' She added: ''It's not an overwhelming problem; it can heal given enough time. We all have to dig down and regroup. He's had better days, but he's had a lot more worse ones, too. He's a fighter.''  As a longtime owner, Roy Jackson said he understood that a horse's health could change ''day to day or sometimes minute to minute.''  He and his wife have spent tens of thousands of dollars on Barbaro's care and have said repeatedly that they would continue to do so as long as the colt can be free of pain and shows a will to live. Barbaro's move is postponed indefinitely, but Jackson said yesterday that the colt appeared to be meeting those standards.  ''Hopefully this is just a hitch in the road,'' he said. ''All we can do is give him the best care and say our prayers.''  HORSE RACING",

            "fulltext": "In the minutes before an overdose of an anesthetic was given to Barbaro on Monday morning to terminate his life, Dr. Dean Richardson took a moment to say goodbye. For Richardson, the surgeon who worked so hard to save Barbaro's life and who developed an emotional attachment to his famous patient, it was a final, and intensely poignant, moment.  As he spoke at a news conference at the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center later in the day, Richardson, the chief of surgery at the Center's Widener Hospital for Large Animals, was clearly upset. He choked up and stopped talking several times, in one instance for at least 10 seconds. He would then take a deep breath to regain his composure and begin speaking again.  Even amid the tears, the 53-year-old Richardson, who has been an equine surgeon at the New Bolton Center for 27 years, had other work to do. Not long after Barbaro was euthanized at 10:30 a.m., Richardson had to attend to another horse. It was an obligation, he said, that helped take his mind off Barbaro. But as the day wore on, the sadness was there, even outright grief.  ''I knew that if this day came, it would be very difficult to keep my composure,'' Richardson said. ''It is what it is. It's not the first horse I've cried over.''  The decision to end Barbaro's life came more than eight months after he shattered his right hind leg in the opening moments of the Preakness Stakes and was taken to the New Bolton Center. Barbaro's owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson, were determined to do everything possible to save Barbaro's life, and in the tall, even-tempered Richardson they found an experienced surgeon with a national reputation who would share their devotion to the difficult task. For Richardson, in some respects, it was the challenge of a lifetime.  In the months that followed, Barbaro and Richardson had any number of good days. In December, Barbaro was doing so well that there was talk that he might soon be released from the New Bolton Center and continue his recovery at a farm in Kentucky. It seemed possible that he would eventually be able to recover enough to move on to a life as a sire.  Richardson was among those who began saying that a corner had been turned in Barbaro's recovery.  ''I'm human,'' he said Monday. ''There were many times I was optimistic he would make it. But at the same time, I am smart enough to know intellectually that all these challenges were there throughout and remained. But it would be hard to get up and go to work every day if I didn't think this could work.''  Only a week ago, Richardson was in Beverly Hills, Calif., with the Jacksons, to accept a special citation at the horse racing industry's annual awards dinner, an event that primarily honors the sport's top horses of the previous year. The award cited the Jacksons and the team at the New Bolton Center for their efforts to save Barbaro.  But by then, a new set of problems had begun for Barbaro. The condition of his left hind foot, which developed laminitis in July and imperiled his life, was again proving troublesome. As the week progressed, the difficulties mounted. But through it all, to the final moments, Richardson found it hard to give up. A graduate of Dartmouth and the Ohio State College of Veterinary Medicine, the son of a Navy doctor, he battled until he had to surrender.  ''I'm very comfortable we made the right decision, which was something that was very difficult to do,'' he said. ''As your typical egotistical surgeon, I would have loved to prove what I can do on a daily basis. But you have to do what is best for the patient.''  Only once on Monday did Richardson's sadness turned to anger -- when he was asked how much Barbaro's care since May 20 had cost. He refused to answer the question and barked at the questioner, ''It's not relevant.''  ''The only gratification I will get out of this is that this horse had eight, nine months of time, the vast majority of which he was a happy horse,'' he said.  Richardson said his experiences with Barbaro would make him an even better surgeon.  ''If I had a horse come in with the same injury tomorrow, I honestly believe I'd have a better chance of saving his life and that's because I probably wouldn't make the same mistakes,'' he said, adding, ''You have to believe you're going to get better at what you do.''

            "fulltext": "In eight months of waiting for Barbaro's shattered bones to heal, the horse's owners and his veterinarian said they had not seen the Kentucky Derby-winning colt become so uncomfortable that he would refuse to lie down and rest. Until Sunday night.  So on Monday morning, the owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson, and the veterinarian, Dr. Dean Richardson, decided enough was enough. At 10:30 a.m., Barbaro was euthanized, ending an extraordinary effort to save the life of a remarkable racehorse whose saga had gripped people around the world.  Many had watched in early May as Barbaro dispatched 19 opponents in the Kentucky Derby in dominating fashion, by a six and a half lengths. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 summoned memories of Affirmed, Seattle Slew and Secretariat, the last three winners of the Triple Crown. But two weeks after that triumph, on May 20, many more were horrified when Barbaro pulled up in the opening yards of the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. His fractured right hind leg dangled awkwardly while his jockey, Edgar Prado, tried to soothe him.  In recent weeks, Barbaro's ailments had become overwhelming: complications with his left hind leg lingered, an abscess in his right hind heel was discovered last week and, finally, a new case of the painful and often fatal condition called laminitis developed in both of his front feet.  ''That left him with not a good leg to stand on,'' Dr. Richardson said Monday at an emotional news conference here at the George D. Widener Hospital for Large Animals. ''He was just a different horse. You could see he was upset. That was the difference. It was more than we wanted to put him through.''  The Jacksons were red-eyed as they explained that it had become clear their horse could not live without pain after a setback over the weekend that required a risky surgical procedure on his right hind leg. The couple had spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to save Barbaro's life, and Ms. Jackson thanked the people who had expressed support for Barbaro through cards, letters, messages and even holy water.  ''Grief is the pain we all pay for love,'' she said.  Fifty feet away, in the hospital's lobby, flowers and notes of condolences continued to arrive. The eight-month effort to nurse Barbaro back to health had riveted people around the world and had reminded casual fans about the beauty, mystery and heartbreak that is part of thoroughbred racing.  The day after his breakdown at the Preakness, Barbaro endured more than five hours of surgery as Dr. Richardson and his team used 27 screws to piece the right hind leg back together. In July, after laminitis had developed in Barbaro's left rear hoof, Dr. Richardson proclaimed the chances for survival as poor. The condition is frequently caused by uneven weight distribution among a horse's legs.  Despite having 80 percent of his hoof removed, Barbaro bounced back, and by mid-August, he was grazing outside the hospital here each day as Dr. Richardson fed him by hand.  The Jacksons visited the colt here each day and fed him grass from their farm in nearby West Grove, Pa. Before Christmas, they were encouraged enough by Barbaro's recovery that they were making plans to move him to a farm in Kentucky, where he could roam the bluegrass and avoid the Northeast winter.  Earlier this month, however, veterinarians discovered that Barbaro's left hind hoof was not growing back properly, and they had to remove some damaged tissue. Last week, the horse developed a deep bruise in his right heel, which Dr. Richardson tried to protect by performing a risky surgery Saturday. He tried to build a framework of metal pins, bars and a plate around the right hind leg to take all the weight off the fragile bone structure, which was already being held together with a matrix of screws.  By Sunday night, laminitis had begun to ravage Barbaro's front legs, and the Jacksons decided there was little else left to do. Barbaro was in too much distress. When they and Dr. Richardson saw the colt struggling Sunday night in a sling designed to take pressure off his legs, they determined Barbaro had lost his will to live.  ''We just reached a point where it was going to be difficult for him to go on without pain,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''It was the right decision. It was the right thing to do. We said all along if there was a situation where it would become more difficult for him, then it would be time.''  As news of Barbaro's death became known early Monday, horsemen felt the loss deeply. Like Seattle Slew, Barbaro left Churchill Downs undefeated in six races. His victories were remarkable for their versatility: on grass, on dirt and at distances of a mile to a mile and a quarter.  The trainer Michael Matz, a former equestrian who won a silver medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, decided as soon as Barbaro arrived as a 2-year-old at his training center in Maryland that this was a preternaturally talented colt.  Mr. Matz aimed to make him the 12th Triple Crown champion, the first in 28 years, with an unorthodox approach. In six of the previous nine years, horses had captured the Derby and the Preakness only to fall short of the Triple Crown and immortality in the Belmont Stakes, the longest and most grueling of the three. Mr. Matz opted for a lighter-than-usual racing schedule for Barbaro, resting him for five to eight weeks between starts. He raced him only once in the 13 weeks before the Derby.  Mr. Matz and the Jacksons had even discussed returning Barbaro to the turf for a European campaign, perhaps culminating in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the most famous race in Europe.  Beyond Barbaro's burgeoning talent, all of his human connections were beguiled by his personality, which blended intelligence with an old soul's temperament, as one of Mr. Matz's assistants, Peter Brette, said.  Gretchen Jackson, who with her husband had been breeding and racing thoroughbreds for more than 30 years, broke the golden rule of horse ownership: She fell in love with Barbaro.  So did much of the world. The gates of the hospital here have been adorned with signs proclaiming love for Barbaro and beseeching him to heal -- ''Grow Hoof Grow'' -- since his arrival. The fruit baskets filled with green apples and carrots, elaborate flower arrangements and get-well cards arrived by the truckload. Since early June, a Barbaro Fund has attracted more than $1.2 million in donations for the hospital, which is part of the New Bolton Center at the University of Pennsylvania.  Online message boards were swamped with Barbaro news and for months became a virtual waiting room. On Monday, one of them, operated by Alex Brown, an exercise rider at the nearby Fair Hill Training Center, had its daily traffic nearly double to 15,000 visitors in a single hour.  ''I love you Barbaro,'' read one message posted by Cheryl -- NY. ''Everyone in my family is praying for you & lighting candles. Stay strong & don't give up! XXOO.''  The Jacksons said they would remember most the good things that had come from Barbaro's brief but brilliant life -- from his Kentucky Derby victory to how he had raised the public's awareness about everything from veterinary medicine to anti-slaughterhouse legislation.  ''Our hope is that some of these issues don't die,'' Mr. Jackson said.  While the couple acknowledged that the decision to put Barbaro down was difficult, neither they nor Dr. Richardson expressed regrets. Even after months on end of being confined in a stall here in the intensive care unit, Barbaro had never been anything but calm and relaxed, Dr. Richardson said.  ''The vast majority of the time he was a happy horse,'' he said.  When that was no longer true Sunday night, all agreed on what had to be done.  Barbaro ate some grass for breakfast Monday morning. He was tranquilized and then a slight overdose of anesthetic was fed to him through a catheter that had already been fitted to him. ''It could not have been more peaceful,'' Dr. Richardson said. He fought back tears throughout the news conference.  When he was asked to make sense of the deep feelings Barbaro had summoned from complete strangers and from those who knew him best, Dr. Richardson perhaps wrote Barbaro's epitaph:  ''People love greatness,'' he said. ''People love the story of his bravery.''",

            "fulltext": "Classical music often focuses on unearthing the old: on resurrection rather than decline. But ''DECASIA'' focuses on decline itself. This film symphony (its name a gloss on ''Fantasia,'' corrupted by ''decay'') consists of a score by MICHAEL GORDON and a video by BILL MORRISON edited from a trove of decaying silver-nitrate film from the early 20th century. The result is a tapestry of images that keep dissolving before the viewer's eyes as Mr. Gordon's music probes at tonality with deliberately mistuned chords. The work, something of a cult classic, is available on DVD but is by all accounts far more powerful in a theater, with live music provided (as it was for the piece's New York concert premiere in 2004) by TACTUS, the Manhattan School of Music's contemporary-music ensemble. Thursday through Saturday at 7 and 9:30 p.m., Angel Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101; $25.  Another blend of old and new takes place on Saturday, Mozart's birthday, when the Masters Reimagined series at Merkin Concert Hall ushers him past his overhyped 250th birthday into the wonderful world of 251. MATT HAIMOVITZ, the acclaimed cellist, and URI CAINE, the jazz pianist, join in a two-part program that first presents Mozart ''straight'' (in a performance of the K. 563 Divertimento, with Mr. Haimovitz) and then ''modern,'' in the premiere of Mr. Caine's ''Mozart Project,'' with his own ensemble performing his updated versions of Mozart excerpts. At 8 p.m., 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $30 in advance, $35 at the door.  Back to resurrection: The GOTHAM CHAMBER OPERA, which has put itself on the opera lovers' map by exploring less-known works from all over the repertory, is turning to outright comedy this year with Rossini's ''Signor Bruschino,'' in which he honed the comic style that catapulted subsequent opera buffas like ''L'Italiana in Algeri'' or ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' to such success. It has not been performed in New York since its American premiere at the Metropolitan Opera in 1932-33 (on a double bill with ''Elektra''). Opens Thursday at 7:30 p.m. (performances continue next week), Harry de Jur Playhouse, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200.  Another highlight this week is THE SONG CONTINUES, the annual series of recitals and master classes that the Marilyn Horne Foundation puts on at Carnegie Hall. This year the master classes have the spotlight: they will be taught by Barbara Cook, Evelyn Lear and Ms. Horne herself. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 5:30 and 7:30 p.m., Friday at 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall and Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $5 to $45.

            "fulltext": "If Rossini had been in the audience on Thursday night at the Harry de Jur Playhouse, he would surely have found the stylish and witty new production of ''Il Signor Bruschino'' by the Gotham Chamber Opera as cheekily funny as everyone else did.  The revival was overdue. ''Il Signor Bruschino,'' the last of five one-act farces Rossini wrote for the Teatro San Mois\u00e8 in Venice between 1810 and 1813, was last staged in New York in 1933, according to the Gotham company.  In this frothy, youthful comedy, Rossini experiments with the comic gift for mistaken identities evident in his later opera ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia.'' The Venetian poet Giuseppe Maria Foppa wrote the libretto for ''Bruschino,'' based on ''Le Fils par Hazard,'' a French farce. Two young lovers, Florville and Sofia, want to marry. But Florville is the son of an enemy of Gaudenzio, Sofia's guardian, who in any event has already promised her to the eminent Bruschino family. Florville waylays and impersonates the legitimate groom, then convinces Gaudenzio that he is Bruschino's son.  Thanks to Robin Guarino's clever directing, an opera that could be mere bumbling slapstick is sharp, with snappy comic timing. Donald Eastman's set updates the action to the Via Veneto in Rome in about 1960. The costume designer Martin Pakledinaz presents Florville, sung by Alek Shrader, as a sort of Marcello Mastroianni, and Sofia, sung by Lisa Hopkins, as a demurely dressed Anita Ekberg.  There were other Felliniesque touches, like a Vespa, a bicycle, a priest and a scampering little boy who knocks on a door to mirror the moment in the overture when the violinists tap their music stands with their bows.  ''Il Signor Bruschino'' has plenty of tongue-twisting recitative and vocal acrobatics, but none of the strong cast seemed trapped in a coloratura torture chamber. At times they even made a merry farce of Rossini's bel canto obstacle course.  There was fiery chemistry between Ms. Hopkins and Mr. Shrader, both promising performers, who sang with good phrasing and control. Eric Jordan gave a fine, confident performance as the jovial, fabulously named Gaudenzio Strappapuppole, who almost seems a personification of Rossini, a cheery, witty gourmand.  Signor Bruschino was updated from a generic buffo character to an oily, scholarly-looking, suit-clad neurotic, excellently acted and sung by Marco Nistico.  As the maid Marianna, Emily Langford Johnson was a sexy, Sophia Loren-like flirt, while Filiberto, the burly barman, was sung with aplomb by Matthew Lau. Steven Goldstein, as the police commissioner and priest, was also strong.  Neal Goren, Gotham's artistic director, conducted a lively, tight performance of the chirpy score. Rossini reportedly declared that he was ''born for opera buffa.'' On Thursday night it seemed that this cast had been as well.  ''Il Signor Bruschino'' continues through Feb. 3 at the Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org.

            "fulltext": "Not many tenors these days excel in the full-bodied, lyric Puccini and Verdi repertory once owned by the likes of Carlo Bergonzi, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Luciano Pavarotti. The closest we have may be the Italian tenor Marcello Giordani, who took over the role of Rodolfo on Wednesday night for the first of four final performances in the Metropolitan Opera's current revival of Puccini's ''Boh\u00e8me.'' His Mimi was the Chilean soprano Cristina Gallardo-Dom\u00e2s, which united the stars of the Met's acclaimed Anthony Minghella production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly.''  It was as Rodolfo that Mr. Giordani made his 1995 Met debut, and it is always rewarding to hear the role sung by a true Puccini tenor. Still, he has been branching out in recent years into weightier repertory, like Verdi's Manrico and, at the Met, the hefty title role of Berlioz's ''Benvenuto Cellini.'' While such choices testify to his adventurousness, they may explain why his Rodolfo seemed to have lost some of the velvety grace and glowing richness of earlier years. At times he ended melodic phrases abruptly and halted in his delivery. At his best Mr. Giordani can certainly invest a Puccini phrase with vibrant sound and soaring lyricism.  Ms. Gallardo-Dom\u00e2s may not have a conventionally beautiful sound, and soft high singing does not come naturally to her. The earthy expressivity and subtle intensity of her singing, however, made her an affecting Mimi.  There were strong performances from the hearty baritone Dwayne Croft, a veteran Marcello; the bright-voiced soprano Ainhoa Arteta as Musetta; and the robust young baritone Aaron St. Clair Nicholson as Schaunard, the role of his Met debut last fall. The most complete vocal and dramatic portrayal came from the charismatic bass-baritone John Relyea as Colline. The bass Paul Plishka did double-duty as the hapless landlord Benoit and the wealthy Alcindoro. Carlo Rizzi was the very capable conductor.  Audiences still swoon when the curtain goes up on the bustling, two-tiered Caf\u00e9 Momus set in Act II of Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant and critic-proof 1981 production. This is one show the new general manager, Peter Gelb, will probably leave be.  ''La Boh\u00e8me'' will be performed tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and Feb. 3 at 1:30 p.m. at the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center.  MUSIC REVIEW",

I could listen to her sing the phone book, but she is devoting her recital at Carnegie Hall on Monday to French art song, for which she has a particular affinity. With the pianist MALCOLM MARTINEAU supporting her, Ms. Graham will sing works, both beloved and obscure, by more than 20 composers, among them Bizet, Franck, Faur\u00e9, Lalo, Gounod, Debussy, Chausson, Duparc, Ravel, Honegger and Poulenc. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $80.  New music is plentiful this week, not least because the JUILLIARD SCHOOL's annual FOCUS FESTIVAL is under way. JOEL SACHS, who assembles and directs Focus, gives each year's concerts a unifying theme, sometimes stylistic, sometimes geographical. This year's series looks at contemporary Hungarian music, with ''contemporary'' defined as post-Bartok. Several of the featured composers -- Gyorgy Kurtag, Gyorgy Ligeti, Peter Eotvos and Istvan Marta, most notably -- are heard frequently in New York, but many of the others on the program are not. That's where to look for the surprising unknowns that Mr. Sachs invariably turns up. Monday through Friday at 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required on Friday.  Coincidentally JOHN SCOTT is presenting the complete organ works of Ligeti (and Jonathan Harvey) on Sunday afternoon at St. Thomas Church. Mr. Scott's concert is part of the Miller Theater's Ligeti tribute. At Miller itself the big draw this week is a Composer Portrait concert devoted to FRANK ZAPPA's classical works, as well as a few transcriptions of his experimental rock pieces, to be performed by the FIREWORKS ENSEMBLE and the ZEPHYROS WINDS. Sunday at 5:15 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street, (212) 854-7799; free. Friday at 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25, $15 for students.  Zappa is not the only rock star whose classical (or at least arguably classical) scores are being heard this week. DAVID BYRNE is represented as well, by his ''Songs From 'The Knee Plays,' '' composed in 1985 for a Robert Wilson production. Thursday at 9 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall; $35 to $45.",

Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200.  Broadway  'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)  'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)  'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  Off Broadway  'AS YET THOU ART YOUNG AND RASH' An abstract collage of shards of feeling built out of Euripides' ''Suppliant Women,'' this meditation on grief and the death of children in senseless war offers plenty of parallels to current society without doing anything so obvious as explicitly referring to them. The five-member cast, led by three beautiful middle-aged women, is strong; the director, David Herskovits, has helped them shape an evocative piece that might be too nonliteral for some tastes, but is both moving and distinctive (1:10). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette)  'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)  *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger)  'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  'GET YOUR WAR ON' Based on the absurdist comic strip of David Rees, this sardonic history lesson of the past six years will delight Bush-haters (1:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)  'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)  'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates)  'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)  'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)  'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)  'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)  'RIDDLELIKELOVE (WITH A SIDE OF KETCHUP)' This one-woman show, in which Julie Fitzpatrick tells of her friendship with a deaf woman, is cloying and thin, but the sign-language interpretation provided at each performance gives it an interesting extra dimension, helping to bring the subject to life (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)  'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)  'THE SCENE' Theresa Rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in Manhattan. Tony Shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, Charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to Patricia Heaton's frazzled chat show booker. Enter femme fatale Clea, played by the gifted Anna Camp, and goodbye, Charlie (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood)  * 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Ginia Bellafante)  '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)  * 'THE VIETNAMIZATION OF NEW JERSEY (AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY)' A revival of Christopher Durang's satire of war, family life and Bicentennial fever, on the 30th anniversary of its debut at the Yale Repertory Theater, swishes along at the speed of a Nascar race. Blanche Baker is a gem as an out-of-it 1970s matron who just can't dust off the Eisenhower era. the Beckett Theater, on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante)  * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  Off Off Broadway  'FLUKE' A meditative collage of enigmatic riffs on ''Moby-Dick'' presented by the rambunctious experimental company Radiohole (1:30). Collapsable Hole, 146 Metropolitan Avenue, at Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-2251. (Zinoman)  Long-Running Shows  'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Tuesday. (Zinoman)  'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)  'PARTY TIME' This multimedia work by the Talking Band looks great, but it's really just a reworking of the old two-guys-in-a-foxhole plot. Here the foxhole is a tank in a desert war; its two occupants (Will Badgett and Joe Roseto) sing about their lives and fears as they try to find a rendezvous point. It's visceral without being illuminating (1:00). LaMaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)  'THE RAPTURE PROJECT' Marionettes of various faiths clash in this confusing modern take on an old brand of Sicilian puppet theater by Great Small Works. A Susan Sontag puppet makes an appearance, as does one that calls to mind a former New York City police commissioner, but more often than not, the musical accompaniment is the liveliest thing about the show (1:30). The Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)  'YOU BELONG TO ME: DEATH OF NATIONS, PART V' The fifth, choppily considered installment of the writer and director Josh Fox's millennial play cycle examines the final days of three wars. Should we think about war primarily in terms of the havoc it wreaks on love and sex? He seems to think so (3:00). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Tuesday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.  * 'ABDUCTION: THE MEGUMI YOKOTA STORY' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Japanese) This documentary about the titular 13-year-old girl -- who vanished on the way home from school in Niigata, Japan, in 1977, and was revealed as a pawn in a North Korean spy-training program -- succeeds as a true crime story, a thumbnail history of a painful recent chapter of Asian history and as a portrait of lives transformed by trauma. Meandering in places, but compassionate and engrossing throughout. (Matt Zoller Seitz)  'ALPHA DOG' (R, 117 minutes) Based on a true Southern California crime, Nick Cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? Well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. Oh, and committing murder. (Manohla Dargis)  'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger)  'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott)  'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Dargis)  * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)  'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)  * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)  'CODE NAME: THE CLEANER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) Cedric the Entertainer clogs the arteries of what could have been a savvy riff on the ''Bourne'' films with way too much ham, playing a janitor who wakes up with amnesia, a dead man beside him. A missing computer chip fuels the plot, aided by Lucy Liu and Nicollette Sheridan. Though it's all too dumb to amuse grownups, it's harmless fun for tweener types. (Genzlinger)  'COMEDY OF POWER' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) Isabelle Huppert is brisk and fierce as a French investigative judge going after corrupt fat cats. The director, Claude Chabrol, is more interested in the forms of ruling-class behavior than in the details of high-level criminality, but his detached, complacent style makes for an interesting contrast with Ms. Huppert's conviction. (Scott)  'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Jeannette Catsoulis)  * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)  'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott)  'FREEDOM WRITERS' (PG-13, 123 minutes) Hilary Swank uses her characteristic neediness to fine effect in a true-to-life story about a teacher making a difference in a Southern California high school. The writer and director Richard LaGravenese provides the smartly laid foundation, but it's the kids who give the film its strong emotional tug. (Dargis)  * 'GOD GREW TIRED OF US' (PG, 90 minutes) This sober, uplifting documentary, which won two major awards at last year's Sundance Film Festival, follows the resettlement in the United States of three Sudanese young men uprooted as children by the civil war. Handsomely photographed, and inspirational but not cloyingly so, it is the rare contemporary documentary that doesn't leave a residue of cynicism and outrage. (Stephen Holden)  'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)  'GURU' (No rating, 166 minutes, in Hindi) The Tamil director Mani Ratnam makes the case for India's growing economic clout with this entertaining epic about the rise and rise of Gurukant Desai, a fictitious Mumbai polyester manufacturer. The actress Aishwarya Rai, as Guru's wife, is a welcome presence, but the picture belongs to Abhishek Bachchan, who gives a rich, varied performance in the title role. (Andy Webster)  'HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER' (PG, 87 minutes) Like Dreamworks's ''Shrek'' comedies, ''Happily'' is a grab-bag parody set in a fantasyland derived from bedtime stories and Disney films. The adopted chambermaid Ella (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar, drawn like Winona Ryder) and the poor dishwasher Rick (Freddie Prinze Jr.) battle Ella's wicked stepmother, Frieda (Sigourney Weaver). Despite self-aware touches, this is another tired kidsploitation product in which a wasp-waisted ing\u00e9nue and a shallow beau drive the plot and live happily ever after. (Seitz)  'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)  * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)  * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)  'MISS POTTER' (PG, 92 minutes) In ''Miss Potter,'' Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, her face pickled in cheeriness, is Beatrix Potter, the creator of Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin and Mrs. Tittlemouse, among other beloved characters in children's literature. As portrayed by Ms. Zellweger, Potter is almost as chipper as Julie Andrews's Mary Poppins, a proto-feminist, proto-environmentalist and perfect lady to boot. There was plenty of drama in Potter's life, but the movie turns major conflicts and losses into minor setbacks in a charmed, entirely virtuous life. The movie is far too nice for its own good. (Holden)  'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) In this chaotic, overstuffed family comedy, Ben Stiller is a night watchman at the American Museum of Natural History, where the exhibits come to life at night and attack him and one another. This computerized spectacle spares no expense, but the storytelling is weak, and the hit-or-miss jokes miss more than hit. (Holden)  'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zo\u00eb Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis)  * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott)  'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)  'PRIMEVAL' (R, 94 minutes) A giant crocodile named Gustave terrorizes Western journalists in war-torn Burundi. Not as much fun as it might have been, but not as terrible either. (Scott)  'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)  * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)  'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)  'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. DJ (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz)  'TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Thai) A western weepie from Thailand, filmed in garish color. In spite of the relentless genre pastiche, it has a charming sincerity. (Scott)  'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)  * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)  'WE ARE MARSHALL' (PG, 128 minutes) This fact-based story of a West Virginia college town recovering from the death of its entire football team in a 1970 plane crash is a stiff, manipulative dud that gets wrong everything ''Friday Night Lights'' got right. Matthew McConaughey hams it up as the college's goofy new coach, who whips the replacement team into decent shape. (Holden)  Film Series  ROBERT ALTMAN REMEMBERED (Tonight through Tuesday) A tribute to the late American filmmaker winds up with several seldom seen Altman films: ''Three Women,'' ''Buffalo Bill and the Indians,'' ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' ''Tanner '88,'' ''Health,'' ''A Wedding,'' ''Secret Honor'' and ''Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean.''

Matt Zoller Seitz, who contributes to The New York Times and publishes The House Next Door Web site, is joined by the director Albert Maysles tomorrow for a screening of Mr. Maysles's 1968 cin\u00e9ma-verit\u00e9 study ''Salesman,'' and Stuart Klawans of The Nation on Sunday presents Nora Jacobson's hard look at real estate development in Hoboken, N.J., ''Delivered Vacant.''

This week's offerings include Li Yu's Chinese film ''Dam Street,'' about the friendship between a washed-up opera singer and a 10-year-old child, which concludes an extended run, with screenings tonight through Monday. On Thursday there's the Kurdistan-French co-production ''Kilometre Zero,'' a story of the ethnic conflict between Kurds and Iraqis set during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, written and directed by Hiner Saleem. (Through Jan. 28.) Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr)  KEN AND AZAZEL JACOBS (Tonight through Tuesday) Anthology Film Archives is holding the premiere engagements of two new films from the avant-garde eminence Ken Jacobs (whose epic exercise in associative editing, ''Star Spangled to Death,'' has recently been released on DVD) and Azazel Jacobs, a son of Mr. Jacobs who is following in his father's footsteps. ''The Goodtimeskid,'' is by the younger Mr. Jacobs and is a 77-minute color feature that follows two men with the same name and a woman involved with them both over the course of 24 hours in Los Angeles. ''Two Wrenching Departures,'' by the senior Mr. Jacobs, is a black-and-white video piece. First produced as a live performance, it is about two of Mr. Jacobs's friends, the underground filmmakers Jack Smith (''Flaming Creatures'') and Bob Fleischner (''Banners''), who died within a week of each other in October 1989.

(Kehr)  Pop  Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.  * 'THE AMERICAN BEAUTY PROJECT' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Grateful Dead had its origins in the folk revival, but it took a while for the band to find the right balance between long-form psychedelic jams and small-scale, acoustic country-folk. A diverse group of musicians gathers this weekend to pay tribute to the Dead's two eureka albums from 1970. Performing songs from ''Workingman's Dead'' tomorrow are the Klezmatics, Ollabelle, the Holmes Brothers, Jim Lauderdale, Larry Campbell and Tim O'Reagan of the Jayhawks. Playing from ''American Beauty'' on Sunday are Mark Eitzel, Jay Farrar, Espers, Toshi Reagon, Jorma Kaukonen, Dar Williams, Mr. Lauderdale, Ollabelle and Mr. Campbell.

(Ben Sisario)  ARAMIR\u00c8 (Tonight) This folk ensemble from the Salento region of Italy is dedicated to one of the lesser-known traditions of the country, the Greek-influenced music of the southeast of Italy's ''heel.'' With strings, accordion, flute and lots of tambourine, it pays particular attention to the pizzica, a galloping six-beat dance related to the tarantella and long used as a faith-healing cure for spider bites. At 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Sisario)  * CAMERA OBSCURA (Wednesday) Like their fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, led by the expressively plain-voiced Tracyanne Campbell, is in love with wistful 1960s folk-pop and plays a country-leaning variation on it with taste and finesse. With the Essex Green. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $15.50 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)  * KRISTIN CHENOWETH (Tonight) This Tony Award-winning treasure plays the Metropolitan Opera House; she's only the third musical-theater person the Met has ever presented in a solo gig. Appearing with a 12-piece orchestra and dancers, she is to add some opera arias to her usual repertory. At 8, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $50 to $200. (Sisario)  CLIPSE (Wednesday) Comeback stories are rare and sweet in rap. In 2002 this Virginia duo rose all the way to No. 4 with sly rhymes about the criminal life and brutally minimal rhythm tracks by the Neptunes. Since then the Clipse struggled in music-industry purgatory but triumphed with ''Hell Hath No Fury'' (Re-Up Gang/Jive), another cold, lean and virtuosic exercise that was one of the best hip-hop albums of 2006. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)  COLD WAR KIDS (Wednesday) The craggy guitars, verge-of-a-breakdown vocals and elliptical songwriting of this band from Austin, Tex., put it at the top of the music-blogger food chain last year. Now comes the hard part: maintaining popularity as the Internet eye roves again. This month the band is bouncing back and forth between New York and Los Angeles each week in a ''bicoastal residency.'' With Illinois and the Virgins. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario)  MARK EITZEL (Tonight) Depression is Mr. Eitzel's element; as leader of the American Music Club and through a solo career, he has anatomized melancholy down to the molecular level. In a weary voice, with tunes that blur folk songs and torch songs in a smoky haze, he looks at estrangement and betrayal, loneliness and separation, and bad luck. At 8, Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $12. (Jon Pareles)  DIAMANDA GAL\u00c1S (Sunday) Though she is invariably dressed in black, with her face in witchy streaks of makeup, Ms. Gal\u00e1s needs only her voice to terrify and seduce. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Sisario)  * GLOBALFEST (Sunday) A one-night crash course in some of the best of what is called world music only because there is no other name for it, Globalfest, now in its fourth year, offers a dozen performers from around the planet. Among them, performing on three stages, are the suave Brazilian songwriter Lenine; Dengue Fever, a band from Los Angeles that resurrects the manically eclectic rock of pre-Khmer Rouge Cambodia; Les Primitifs du Futur, a French retro jazz-blues-Gypsy string band; Sara Tavares, a sensuous Cape Verdean singer; Lila Downs, whose take on Mexican rancheras and cumbias can be raucous or reverent; Le Trio Joubran, three oud-playing Palestinian brothers; and Andy Palacio and the Garifuna Collective, from Belize. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com or globalfest-ny.org; $40. (Sisario)  GOB IRON (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jay Farrar of Son Volt and Anders Parker of Varnaline have built careers on the idea of ragged, rock-tinged roots music: a little less grungy than Neil Young, a bit more plebeian than Bob Dylan. On ''Death Songs for the Living'' (Transmit Sound/Legacy), their joint album as Gob Iron, they repaint centuries of American music by the Carter Family, Josh White and Stephen Foster in gray, bleak tones; even Clarence Ashley's sprightly ''Coo-Coo Bird'' gets a despondent rewrite. Tonight at 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; tomorrow at 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario)  PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students offer their tribute to Black Sabbath, and if there is any guitar riff especially appropriate for 12-year-olds, it's ''Iron Man.'' At 2:30 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $10. (Sisario)  HOLMES BROTHERS AND ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Tuesday) Steeped in blues and gospel, Sherman and Wendell Holmes harmonize and raise the rafters with songs that draw hope from hard times. Their version of gospel is a close neighbor of Southern soul and country. They are joined by Allen Toussaint, the musical statesman from New Orleans, for two sets. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Pareles)  JERRY LEE LEWIS (Tonight) People pounded on pianos and hollered about hellfire before Jerry Lee Lewis, but nobody put it together in quite his way, which is the rock 'n' roll way. Now 71, Mr. Lewis recently released his first new album in 11 years, ''Last Man Standing'' (Artist First), which features appearances by the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton, all happily overshadowed. With Jack Grace. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $90. (Sisario)  LIGHTNING BOLT (Sunday) At first it is hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt -- a stalwart of the big noise-punk scene in Providence, R.I. -- is being made by only two people. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario)  LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Tonight and tomorrow night) Now in its ninth season, this series has greatly expanded from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. Tonight the Broadway soprano Judy Kuhn offers songs by Laura Nyro, who, along with Joni Mitchell, established the model for confessional, force-of-nature women's songwriting. Tomorrow Michael Franks plays his own music, including recent Brazilian-inspired works. At 8:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out. (Sisario)  LUNA LOUNGE (Tonight and tomorrow night) For a decade beginning in 1995, the Luna Lounge was one of the better rock dives on the Lower East Side, and not just for its foosball table; its tiny back room was host to thousands of bands who played free, including some, like Interpol and the Strokes, who went on to bigger things. A year and a half after losing its lease, the club reopens with roomier digs in Brooklyn, and if the bookings are any indication, the indie tradition will continue even if the no-cover policy will not. The Comas, a band from North Carolina with psychedelic leanings, headlines tonight with Falcon, from Brooklyn. Tomorrow features three appropriately little-known New York bands, Orange Park, the Picture and Motel Creeps. At 8, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, lunalounge.com; $10 tonight, $5 tomorrow. (Sisario)  HUGH MASEKELA, KLEZMATICS (Sunday) The South African flugelhorn player Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. The Klezmatics love the laughing, moaning melodies of traditional klezmer music. They also love jazz, rock and downtown improvisation, and they bring all those styles to bear on their music, which can be raucous, hypnotic, reverent and dizzying, sometimes all in one quick-changing piece. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)  ERIN McKEOWN (Tuesday and Wednesday) A smiley sprite whose knack for wordplay and light touch on the guitar have sometimes evoked Tin Pan Alley, Ms. McKeown took the plunge in her new album, ''Sing You Sinners'' (Nettwerk), recording 12 nuggets by Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Fats Waller and others (along with one by herself). If her voice is not quite up to the subtleties of wit the songs demand, her joy of discovery is sincere. With Sean Hayes. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario)  MEXICAN INSTITUTE OF SOUND (Tomorrow) A one-man mash-up of Mexican and Latin American music of the past and perhaps the future, Camilo Lara, from Mexico City, artfully mingles cumbias and cha-chas with dub and slippery electronica. Like Moby, he spins a dream of groovy eternal life through sounds that retain their kitsch and dance potential forever. With the Gritty Midi Gang. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $10. (Sisario)  * MISSION OF BURMA (Tonight) In the early 1980s this innovative and widely influential Boston band brought sharp, brainy guitar minimalism to American postpunk, and since reuniting in 2002 after almost 20 years, it still plays with passion and smarts. Here the band appears with two worthy descendants: Oneida and Turing Machine, both of Brooklyn. At 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario)  ANDERS PARKER (Wednesday) Mr. Parker, who led the band Varnaline, immerses his songs in the stoic drama of country and folk music, resulting in a melancholy that is sometimes indistinguishable from cynicism. (''The hours I've wasted here I could have wasted anywhere.'') At 9 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario)  BOB SEGER AND THE SILVER BULLET BAND (Thursday) In the fall Mr. Seger released ''Face the Promise'' (Capitol), his first new album in a decade. It's O.K., but a better illustration of what remains powerful in Mr. Seger's music was his performance of ''America the Beautiful'' at Game 1 of the last World Series: in a tender, soulful rasp, he evoked rock's gospel roots, and made a simple patriotic ode bring a stadium roaring to its feet. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $79.50. (Sisario)  * RICKY SKAGGS WITH BRUCE HORNSBY (Sunday) One of the most virtuosic musicians in bluegrass, Ricky Skaggs sends his fingers flying in a blur over mandolin, guitar and fiddle. He performs with Bruce Hornsby, whose years playing with the Grateful Dead made him a more versatile and playful musician. The two of them have a new album, due in March, that looks particularly versatile and playful: they do a version of Rick James's ''Super Freak.'' Sunday's concert also features opening sets by Shawn Colvin and Paul Thorn. At 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $55 in advance, $60 at the door. (Sisario)  SUBDUDES (Tomorrow) The Subdudes, from New Orleans, make cozy, mostly unplugged roots-rock: straightforward sentiments in tunes that mix a little country, a little blues, a little soul, a little zydeco and a little swing. The group's original lineup disbanded in 1996, but three founding members have revived the band and since 2004 released two new albums. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles)  ZS (Sunday and Monday) The Zs, one of the most active avant-rock groups in New York, plays kinetic pieces that sputter forth in Morse code dots of percussion and saxophone. On Monday it plays with Dave Longstreth, whose band Dirty Projectors constructs elaborate ''glitch operas'' with precise harmonies and stark pluckings of guitar and strings, all arranged slightly out of whack. Sunday at 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. Monday at 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934, zebuloncafeconcert.com; no cover.

AMPERSAND/KNEEBODY (Tuesday) The guitarist Tim Ziesmer features his own rock-influenced compositions in Ampersand, with Chris Speed on tenor saxophone, Dave Ambrosio on bass and Ted Poor on drums.

(Nate Chinen)  * THE BAD PLUS (Tuesday through Thursday) The pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer David King constitute the Bad Plus, a delivery system for smartly sweeping original songs as well as wryly affectionate renditions of pop tunes. They caused a stir among jazz purists when they first headlined at the Village Vanguard a few years ago; by now the engagement has become a happy ritual, and the band has nothing to prove but its own continuing vitality. (Through Jan. 28.) At 9 and 11 p.m. (with a 12:30 set on Jan. 27), Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)  * DON BYRON (Monday) Jazz has many card-carrying eclectics these days, but none more self-assured than the clarinetist Don Byron, who will match wits with two very different pianists: Ursula Oppens, a classical interpreter known for the range of her interests, and Kenny Barron, an improviser with a soulfully sophisticated style.

Handel's early pastoral opera has been the subject of debate since it was written. Probably first performed for a private group at a country estate, it was later revived as a staged opera by another manager eager to capitalize on Handel's Italian-opera success -- in competition with Handel's own opera company. Now, New York, having experienced the work on an operatic scale in City Opera's 2001 production, can sample it in a more intimate form: presented by the five-member Aulos Ensemble (acclaimed early-music specialists) and four vocal soloists at the Met -- not the opera, but the museum. At 6:30 p.m., Medieval Sculpture Hall, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. (Anne Midgette)  'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Wednesday) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Boh\u00e8me'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera for its first airing of the new year, and the Chilean soprano Cristina Gallardo-Dom\u00e2s returns to sing Mim\u00ec, the role with which she made her house debut in 1996. Her Rodolfo is the excellent tenor Marcello Giordani; they both have the vocal and dramatic chops to make an impact in Zeffirelli's massive sets. Ainhoa Arteta is Musetta, Dwayne Croft is Marcello, and Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 tickets remaining. (Vivien Schweitzer)  'THE FIRST EMPEROR'  (Monday and Thursday) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread interest among the general public in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score to ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' have resulted in a sold-out run for ''The First Emperor.'' Alas, though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving, ponderous and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. But his music seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. There are two more performances. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org. (Anthony Tommasini)  * 'MOSTLY OPERETTA' (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) The Austrian Cultural Forum's innovative festival, which pairs 20th-century operetta in intimate recitals with contemporary visuals in an effort to move the genre into the 21st century, winds up this week with three programs by Viennese singers who specialize in operetta: two programs that pay homage to some composers forced to emigrate by the Nazis, and a selection of Kurt Weill's songs arranged into what the forum's director calls ''a kind of 'Winterreise.' '' At 7 p.m, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required. (Midgette)  * 'IL SIGNOR BRUSCHINO' (Thursday) Mention Rossini and most people come up with ''The Barber of Seville,'' but this work -- in which the composer honed the comic gift that came to the fore in ''Barber'' and other ''opere buffe'' -- hasn't been staged in New York since 1933. The Gotham Chamber Opera has set itself apart among the city's small opera companies with quality performances of less-known operas (with good singers), conducted by the company's founder, Neal Goren: it is opening this frothy piece of fun with a gala performance on Thursday. (The run continues, at normal ticket prices, next week.) At 7:30 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org; $300. (Midgette)  'THE TENDER LAND' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In 1976, when the enterprising Bronx Opera Company first presented Copland's ''Tender Land,'' the composer participated in rehearsals and attended productions. For its current production, the company is using the effective chamber version of the orchestral score arranged by Murry Sidlin. Royston Coppenger is the director, and Michael Spierman conducts. At 2 p.m., Heckscher Theater, El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (718) 960-8833, bronxopera.org; $20 to $35. (Tommasini)  * 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tuesday) The admirable soprano Hei-Kyung Hong gives a beautifully sung and deeply felt portrayal of Violetta in the Met revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production. The other news is the promising performance of an artist who, like Ms. Hong, is also from South Korea: the tenor Wookyung Kim, singing Alfredo in his Met debut season. As a Verdi tenor, Mr. Kim is a little green. But he has an appealing and robust voice, and at his best, sings with ardor and flair. The baritone Charles Taylor, who was ill on opening night, is scheduled to sing Germont. Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175. (Tommasini)  Classical Music  * ALARM WILL SOUND (Tomorrow) This supremely inventive new-music ensemble offers an expansive look at the music of Edgard Var\u00e8se in Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series. Among the 10 works on the program are the early ''Grand Sommeil Noir''; ''Ionisation,'' for percussion ensemble; ''Density 21.5,'' for flute; and several orchestral works. The main curiosity, though, is an orchestrated arrangement of the ''Po\u00e8me \u00c9lectronique,'' which is normally heard in the electronic tape version that Var\u00e8se completed in 1958. At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25; $15 for students. (Allan Kozinn)  DANIEL BARENBOIM  (Tomorrow and Sunday) In a charming and revealing program note (available on carnegiehall.org), Mr. Barenboim writes of having been reared from his earliest years on Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier.'' When he arrived at 12 for his first lesson in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, this formidable teacher opened the score to the Prelude in E minor from Book 1 and told him, ''Play it for me in A minor.'' This weekend Mr. Barenboim, a formidable pianist, will play that prelude (in the original key) in his two-program survey of the complete 48 preludes and fugues from Bach's monumental work. Book 1 tomorrow at 8 p.m., Book 2 on Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108. (Tommasini)  KRISTIAN BEZUIDENHOUT (Thursday) This South African fortepianist gave a fine recital at the Miller Theater in November, and returns with another program, as part of the Boston Early Music Festival's series in the Morgan Library & Museum's intimate new hall. His program includes Mozart's Sonata in F (K. 494) and Variations on ''Unser dummer P\u00f6bel meint'' (K. 455); Benda's Sonata in A minor; and Haydn's Variations in F minor. At 7:30 p.m. (preconcert lecture at 7), Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org; $45; $35 for members. (Kozinn)  CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) Music for four-hand piano used to be a staple of the repertory, particularly in the days before recordings, when the way most people enjoyed music was to play it themselves. In this program seven pianists (including Charles Wadsworth, a past director of the society, and Wu Han, a current co-director, as well as Gilbert Kalish and Anne-Marie McDermott) take on works for four hands by Mozart, Mendelssohn, Faur\u00e9, Stravinsky and Lutoslawski (whose Variations on a Theme of Paganini is the only one to employ two separate pianos). Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Midgette)  * 'DECASIA' (Thursday) The composer Michael Gordon and the filmmaker Bill Morrison have collaborated on this enveloping multimedia work. Mr. Morrison's contribution is a fast-cut montage of antique films, in which bubbles and other signs of decay create patterns as crucial to the work as the images of cowboys, flappers, factory workers, dancers, parachutists and exotic scenes from the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. Gordon's powerful 65-minute score -- played by an orchestra deployed in the balconies -- evolves from a faint, metallic rattle to a barrage of percussion, electric guitars, brass choirs, woodwinds and strings. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101; $25. (Kozinn)  * HILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Sunday) In its performance on the Music Before 1800 series, this British vocal ensemble, here in a quartet configuration (David James, Rogers Covey-Crump, Steven Harrold and Gordon Jones), sings the Lassus Requiem, with antiphons and motets by Palestrina interposed between the movements. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 to $40; $5 off for students and 62+. (Kozinn)  KIRILL GERSTEIN (Sunday) The Metropolitan Museum presents the third of four young up-and-coming pianists in its Accolades series. This week the spotlight is on the Russian pianist Kirill Gerstein, who won first prize at the 2001 Arthur Rubinstein Piano Competition and was awarded the 2002 Gilmore Young Artist Award. He will perform Haydn's Sonata in D (Hob. XVI:37), Schumann's whimsical ''Humoresque,'' Ligeti's \u00c9tudes, Busoni's Sonatina No. 6 and an arrangement of the Scherzo from Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony. At 2:30 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $20. (Schweitzer)  * MOSCOW SOLOISTS (Thursday) Wu Man, the fleet-fingered and adventurous Chinese pipa player, frequently adds the sound of her exotic instrument to Western ensembles. With the violist Yuri Bashmet and his Moscow Soloists (a group formed in 1992 and made up of young graduates of the Moscow Conservatory), she will perform Tan Dun's Concerto for String Orchestra and Pipa (a pipa is a Chinese lute), a work whose premiere she performed in 2001. The program also includes Toru Takemitsu's ''Nostalgia'' and his Three Film Scores for Strings, and Hikaru Hayashi's Concerto for Viola and Strings, ''Elegie.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 and $40. (Schweitzer)  NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Thursday) Riccardo Muti, the exacting Italian maestro, is in town for two weeks to conduct the Philharmonic. This weekend's program offers the brilliant violinist Vadim Repin in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto and Scriabin's strangely mystical and musically visionary Symphony No. 3, ''Le Divin Po\u00e8me.'' On Thursday Mr. Muti presents the first of three performances of an all-Italian program, with ballet music from Verdi's ''Macbeth,'' Respighi's ''Feste Romane'' and a little-known piano concerto from 1885 by Giuseppe Martucci, a work admired by Toscanini, Mahler and, of course, Mr. Muti. Gerhard Oppitz is the soloist. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96. (Tommasini)  JORGE FEDERICO OSORIO (Monday) This Mexican pianist has recorded everything from Brahms to Ponce (and, most recently, Mozart violin sonatas with Ani Kavafian) but has only infrequently performed in New York. His solo recital juxtaposes works by two Spanish composers, Soler and Alb\u00e9niz, with preludes by Debussy, showpieces by Liszt and Beethoven's Sonata No. 30. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $20 to $45. (Midgette)  * 'REQUIEM FOR DARFUR' (Monday) The Democracy Council, a human-rights advocacy group, is sponsoring this performance of Verdi's magisterial Requiem by musicians from orchestras including the New York and Berlin Philharmonics and the Met and Philadelphia Orchestras. The event, which benefits Unicef and other charities involved in aid work in Darfur, has Mia Farrow as its host, and features as soloists the soprano Alexandra Deshorties, the mezzo-soprano Sarah Heltzel, the tenor Scott Piper and the bass Morris Robinson; George Mathew conducts. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $27 to $500. (Schweitzer)  RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Tomorrow) Even by its own adventurous standards, the Riverside Symphony is offering an offbeat program tomorrow. The most eclectic item is Villa-Lobos's Harmonica Concerto. The harmonica virtuoso Robert Bonfiglio says he has performed the work more than 350 times. I've never heard it. Have you? Here is your chance, on a program that also offers Mozart's ''Haffner'' Symphony and Honegger's Neo-Classical Symphony No. 4 (''Delights of Basel''). George Rothman conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $50. (Tommasini)  ABBEY SIMON (Tuesday) The Walter W. Naumburg Foundation is offering a retrospective concert series in which it presents former winners of its competition. Mr. Simon, the pianist, won in 1941, and his recordings of the Romantic repertory have always been highly regarded, with Chopin as a particular favorite. At his ''Naumburg Looks Back'' recital, he plays music of Chopin and Schumann. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)  * 'THE SONG CONTINUES' (Tuesday through Thursday) The master classes are going to be a hotter ticket than the recitals at the Marilyn Horne Foundation's annual celebration of the art of song. Leading off at Zankel Hall is the celebrated Barbara Cook; the next night it's the soprano Evelyn Lear; on Thursday it's Ms. Horne herself. The duo recitals by young artists supported by Ms. Horne's foundation, like Joslin Romphf, a soprano, and Lee Poulis, a baritone, on Wednesday; or Hanan Alattar, a soprano, and Timothy Falton, a tenor, on Thursday, have been relegated to the 5:30 time slot at Weill Recital Hall. (The series continues with a gala concert next Friday.) Master classes, Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; recitals, Wednesday and Thursday at 5:30 p.m.; Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 for master classes; $5 for recitals; some events sold out. (Midgette)  TAKACS QUARTET (Tonight) This string quartet has undergone a few personnel changes in recent years, and in the process its sound and focus have improved considerably. A Beethoven cycle at Lincoln Center two years ago showed it to be in remarkable form. This time Takacs offers Debussy's Quartet and Shostakovich's Quartet No. 11, before returning to Beethoven for the Quartet in A minor (Op. 132). At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $45. (Kozinn)  * TOKYO STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) This venerable quartet continues its residency at the 92nd Street Y and its commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Schumann's death with a performance of his String Quartet in A minor. The program also includes Schumann's poignant song cycle ''Dichterliebe,'' sung by the fine Canadian lyric baritone Russell Braun, accompanied by the pianist Carolyn Maule. Paul Hecht, an actor, will read poems from Heinrich Heine's ''Lyrisches Intermezzo,'' on which Schumann based these songs. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer)  Dance  Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.  RUTH CANSFIELD DANCE (Tonight through Sunday night) In its first New York performances, this Canadian company will present three dances by Ruth Cansfield, set to music by Debussy, Rachmaninoff and Crumb, that explore characters' hidden stories, movement without artifice and voyages of the soul.

(Dunning)  CHEZ BUSHWICK: 'AMBUSH: A CURE FOR APAP' (Tomorrow) Bless the Bushwickites for this shrug at the phenomenon of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, which brings dance producers to New York City en masse to assess the talent during a hectic few days -- frustrating to some dance artists -- of conferences and performing. Contributors to the Bushwick program are Matthew Barney, Jonah Bokaer, Foofwa d'Imobilit\u00e9, Sam Kim, Jennifer Lacey, Antonietta Vicario and Jeremy Wade. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Fire Proof, 119 Ingraham Street, Brooklyn, (718) 418-4405, www.bam.org/events; $5.

For this event's 10th anniversary, the Japan Society has relocated to the Joyce. But the eclectic, pop-influenced sampler should be as strange and beguiling as ever. Two programs feature work by Pappa Tarahumara, Kim Itoh & the Glorious Future, Leni-Basso and Noism07. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $30; $23 for members. (Claudia La Rocco)  * LOWER LIGHTS COLLECTIVE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Members of this multimedia group have worked with some pretty impressive people in dance. And how can you go wrong with a company that describes its collaborative process as ignoring one another while allowing for the subtle influence of what is seen out of the corner of the eye? In its new ''CRAM,'' the group will pour dance; a ''live horror film''; sound and noise installations; a ''living sculpture'' using potatoes as percussion; and an orchestra of instruments made from architectural salvage into every cranny of this space. At 8, Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15.

This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)  COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. It covers medical innovation, military hardware, frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)  * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)  * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,' through Feb. 19. The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad, and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)  * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92) portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)  * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)  * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,' through Jan. 29. This gripping show reminds us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org. (Holland Cotter)  * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)  WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)  Galleries: Chelsea  * ROBERT IRWIN: 'WHO'S AFRAID OF RED, YELLOW AND BLUE 3' In the past, Robert Irwin has paid homage to Joseph Albers. Now he makes a bow to a different kind of perceptual magician, Barnett Newman, turning Newman's 1966-70 paintings titled ''Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue'' into a kind of self-reflective architecture. Optical illusionism has long been Mr. Irwin's calling card, but here he has achieved it by bare-bones means, offering quieting visual fare for an overstimulated world. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-7000, pacewildenstein.com, through Feb. 3. (Cotter)  * JAPAN, INC. See this show of work by six painters who are either Japanese or inspired by Japanese culture primarily for Iona Rozeal Brown's dynamic new canvas ''King Kata.'' Through sharpened color and scale and by taking more liberties with her sources, Ms. Brown has markedly increased the visual punch of her characteristic kimono-and-cornrows cross-cultural fusion of cartoons, Japanese woodblock actor prints and gangsta chic. Her contribution underscores the vacuousness of much contemporary realist painting. Kravets Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, through Feb. 17. (Smith)  Other Galleries  * 'THE CONSTANT POSSIBILITY OF ERASURE,' through Jan. 29. Organized by Donna Harkavy and Gracie Mansion, this excellent group show is at once witty and elegaic, exploring transience as an existential reality and as a conceptual ploy in late-20th-century art. Robert Rauschenberg's 1953 ''Erased De Kooning'' is an important reference point, present through Mike Bidlo's painstaking recreation. Joseph Beuys, Gary Simmons and Christian Xarec all have chalk pieces on blackboards, while Allan Kaprow preferred drawing, and simultaneously erasing, chalk pictures on the sidewalks or streets. Joanne Stamerra Hendricks uses erasers as a medium, and Jim Dingilian uses smoke. Dorsky Gallery Curatorial Projects, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-6317. (Cotter)  * OLIVER HALSMAN ROSENBERG: 'DADA FOR GRANDMA,' through Jan. 28. Mr. Rosenberg conceived this show of a dozen lovely, small gouache paintings with references to the zodiac, the Kabala and Egyptian and Hindu cosmology as a tribute to his grandmother Yvonne Halsman who died last year. She was the wife of the Dada photographer Phillipe Halsman, and Dada zaniness has its part in the show. The artist has turned the paintings into an ingeniously low-tech ''prayer wheel'' set into motion by the visitor pedaling his grandmother's exercise bicycle. Mr. Rosenberg, a founder of the alternative space Triple Base in San Francisco who is, with Clint Taniguchi, half of the collaborative Crust & Dirt, has other drawings in a box at Triple Candie, worth a look. Little Cakes, 625 East Sixth Street, Apt. 1B, East Village, (646) 342-1056. (Cotter)  Last Chance  BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. Not surprisingly, her celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. It reduces these often vivid portrayals to the size of their natural, magazine habitat and allows the viewer to skim for the good ones, as if turning pages. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000; closes on Sunday. (Smith)  * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK' If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, sometimes with bits of colored glass scattered over them. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces that he artfully cut, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the city's wired energy and architectural vivacity. The two groups are united for the first time in this show, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)  * THE MET: 'BRUSH AND INK: THE CHINESE ART OF WRITING' If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Cotter)  EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MERENGUE: VISUAL RHYTHMS' AND 'THIS SKIN I'M IN: CONTEMPORARY DOMINICAN ART FROM EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO'S PERMANENT COLLECTION,' Although ''Merengue,'' the larger of the two shows at El Museo, is made up almost entirely of paintings, it is about music, namely the national popular music of the Dominican Republic. Most of the 40 or so pictures, dating from the 1930s to the 1990s, document the music being performed or danced to; a few seem to be formal responses to its percussive beat. In a second, smaller show, merengue's vaunted joie de vivre gets some critical prodding from artists of Dominican descent living in New York. El Museo Del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)  P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ALTERED, STITCHED AND GATHERED' Art by users might be the subtitle here, given that the show's 26 artists operate in the capacious gap between modernist assemblage and postmodern appropriation. Everything from e-mail messages to Wal-Mart plastic hangers and the movie ''Rambo'' are reused, often to comment on history, consumerism and war. Earlier efforts by Yoko Ono, Ben Vautier and Jaques Villegl\u00e9 provide background. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org, closes on Tuesday. (Smith)  * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD' This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)  Correction:  January 30, 2007, Tuesday  A classical music entry in the Listings pages of Weekend on Jan. 19 misstated the history of the performance in New York of ''Il Signor Bruschino,'' by Rossini, which the Gotham Chamber Orchestra is performing through Saturday.

The event started in 2004 as a world-music showcase for concert bookers gathered at the annual conference of the Association of Performing Arts Promoters, and it has outgrown its initial home at the Public Theater. This year it moves to Webster Hall, so there's room for a general audience. A dozen acts are in the lineup, each offering a different perspective on how the traditional meets the present. LENINE, one of Brazil's most beloved songwriters, will play an acoustic set that's likely to merge the maracatu rhythms of Recife with his own gift for melody. SARA TAVARES draws on the Afro-Portuguese rhythms of the Cape Verde Islands, while ANDY PALACIO AND THE GARIFUNA COLLECTIVE play African-rooted music from Central America. LILA DOWNS carries the husky drama of Mexican tradition into songs addressed to both sides of the border. And Lucia Pulido, a Colombian singer based in New York, leads PALENQUE, which weaves jazzy accompaniments around traditional songs.  DENGUE FEVER is a Los Angeles band with a Cambodian lead singer and a taste for 1960s psychedelic rock from both California and Asia. BOOM PAN, an Israeli trio of guitar, tuba and percussion, delivers modal melodies with the twangy reverb of surf guitar. JULIA SARR, a singer from Senegal, and PATRICE LAROSE, a guitarist from France, mingle African vamps, French pop and a touch of flamenco.  A French contingent also includes the peppy BABYLON CIRCUS, which connects the horns and oompah of ska to accordion-driven cabaret, big-band swing and some political thoughts; LES PRIMITIFS DU FUTUR, playing jazzy songs that echo the 1920s and 1930s; and LE TRIO JOUBRAN, Palestinian brothers who adapt Middle Eastern classical pieces for the oud. American tradition is also on the bill with the CAROLINA CHOCOLATE DROPS, a string band revitalizing the African-American roots of old-timey music from the Piedmont.

            "fulltext": "To the Editor:  Brad Leithauser's review of Robert Fagles's new translation of the Aeneid (Dec. 17) flattens out the complexities of Virgil's epic. Leithauser suggests that the gods control the world of the Aeneid and that ''relatively little malice and unreasonableness and rapacity seem innate to our kind.'' Yet Virgil has one of his characters in Book 9 question whether his internal lust for war is prompted by the gods or whether people simply deify their own desires. Virgil's epic is full of these hints that Aeneas' god-given mission might be prompted by his own deified desires and that the epic gods are an allegorical, literary device. In addition, Leithauser states that ''Virgil was wrong'' to suggest that Rome's glory ''will never fade,'' but it's Virgil's characters who suggest this -- not Virgil. As Edward Rothstein put it in a recent New York Times column: ''The argument has been made that Virgil's project was actually ironic, anti-Augustan: he showed how civilization itself is drenched in blood, with self-celebratory history being written by the victors.''  Leah Kronenberg  New Brunswick, N.J.  The writer is assistant professor of classics, Rutgers University.  To the Editor:  ''Arms and the man I sing.'' Oops, or is it ''Wars and a man I sing''? Darn, or is it something or other else?  Why should one read Robert Fagles, or any other middleman, instead of actually reading Virgil? Why anything but ''Arma virumque cano''?  If one is too lazy to learn Latin, it is surely a waste of time to read Fagles under the illusion that one is reading Virgil. Try Shakespeare instead.  John Winkler  Arlington, Mass.",

            "fulltext": "To the Editor:  In her review of Robert Richardson's biography of William James (Dec. 17), Rebecca Newberger Goldstein misunderstands James's concept of ''the divided self,'' which is central to his interpretation of religion. Concerned to highlight the connection between James's personal experience and his philosophical views, she describes James as a ''deeply divided man'' because he wasted much time trying to decide what profession to pursue. She then claims that he defined the divided self as a ''technical term in psychology,'' implying that it means merely a self struggling to make a decision.  The fact is that the divided self is for James an essentially religious concept describing the inner turmoil and division so well expressed by the anguished words of St. Paul -- ''The good I would, I do not, and that I would not, that I do, O wretched man that I am.'' James rightly saw this as the confession of human sin, the conflict between the self that knows what ought to be done and the same self acknowledging its inability to do it. That the divided self had basically religious significance for James is shown in two of his other examples -- St. Augustine and John Bunyan -- each of whom has left us vivid accounts of his own grappling with the divided self that defines the human predicament in biblical religion.

Richardson's biography of William James discussed the same issue as one of the assigned paper topics: Compare Pascal's wager with James's will to believe.  Goldstein properly points to some similarities, but there is a major difference. If you win Pascal's wager you win salvation; if you win James's bet you gain something more suitable to a philosopher: new evidence. For some people the world looks entirely different after taking an art class than it did before. They see the same material objects; but everything takes on a different meaning. James is raising the possibility that the same is true for a spiritual universe. Before the leap the universe is solely material; afterward, thanks to our openness, we see the same universe as invested with religious meaning. James, the perfect amalgamation of religious and scientific temperaments, tried his entire life to make this leap, but was never satisfied with the evidence he saw.  Steven B.

This week, in his review of Barbara Ehrenreich's ''Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy,'' Pinsky considers the cultural importance of Carnival, rock concerts and other celebratory mass events -- phenomena not as far from the world of poetry as it might seem. ''The emotional force of mass gatherings has profound importance,'' he explained in an e-mail message. ''I think we are desperate for something to counterbalance performances, great though they may be, that we experience electronically. We crave something else, something more personal as well as communal.'' The public readings sponsored by the Favorite Poem Project, he says, ''are among the most interesting group events I have witnessed: less performance than participation, and with a spirit hard to name, but unforgettable, and generated not just by each reader or poem, but by everyone there, together.''

The measurements of the space on one wall and two or four or seven pictures require a kind of visual algebra that I have no aptitude for.

And should they be grouped or evenly spaced? Determining the correct amount of space between the pictures throws the calculations into ever greater confusion.  And then there are the structural issues of where to hang the hook. Once the most you could do was knock on the wall; when the sound changed, you knew you had hit on something solid -- with any luck, a stud that could support a nail and whatever was going to hang on it. If your house happens to conform to current construction standards, the studs are generally centered 16 inches apart, which makes it easy to determine where the supports are.  But if you still don't know, there are tools to help you. There is the stud finder, an electronic device outfitted with circuitry that is capable of detecting changes in material behind the surface it passes over; run it across a wall, and it beeps when it detects a stud.  Once the stud finder has located the studs in the wall, you can then use a laser level, a battery-operated device that shines a thin beam of light along the wall, eliminating the need to draw a line in pencil or otherwise mark the wall.  When it comes to the hanging itself, I had always thought traditional picture hangers to be sufficient. Even more dependable, I now learn, is the Hercules Hook, whose breathless ads on cable TV promise that it has the muscle to hang and hold up to 150 pounds. The hook has a curved rod of reinforced steel, sharpened at one end, that can simply be twisted, pushed and turned into the wall. Its curved form allows it to brace itself on the back of the wall, and it punctures the wall with surgical precision, leaving nothing but a pin-sized hole.  Despite having such tools available to me, when I finally faced the labored calculus of aligning the pictures and determining their appropriate proximity, I knew I was still without the most important tool of all, which was the intuition essential for such an endeavor. I called upon my friend and neighbor Myron Adams to help me. He has an instinctive knowledge about such things, some innate grasp of where things belong.  When I asked him how he came by this skill, he told me that his father, an architect, knew where everything was supposed to go. ''It seemed a little totalitarian,'' he said, ''but, in fact, it was very instructive.'' And as a teenager, Myron had once worked for an artist who hung her own paintings. ''She had no rules or tricks,'' he said. ''She was just a classy lady who knew how to eyeball things.'' Which, it occurred to me, would be a nice way to be remembered, and I became all the more determined to get the hang of it.  What with stud finders and Hercules Hooks, you might think hanging pictures is a high-testosterone enterprise that requires some kind of manly heft. That was not my experience. A different kind of stamina was called for, I found. Because for all the exacting tools at hand, it still remained an imprecise exercise. The calculations were made even more elusive by the fact that these were pictures of my family -- an old portrait of my great-great-grandmother Frances, who gazed down at us sternly across the distance the years have conferred on her; a watercolor of my mother that captured the tentativeness of her teenage years; and pastels of my sons when they were 10, staring out of their frames with the cheerful defiance that comes so naturally to young boys.  And then there was the question of those frames. Surrounding Frances is a heavy gilt frame with elaborate scrollwork; the portrait has a weight that might actually justify a Hercules Hook, if its name didn't seem like such an affront to her 19th-century reserve. A simple wood frame is around my mother, and with the boys the frames are more casual still. But for Myron, such visual inconsistency is cause for delight, just another sign of the generational disparity that makes life interesting. Almost effortlessly he managed to find a place on the wall for all of the portraits.  None of the subjects ever knew each other. My mother died long before her grandsons were born, so this is as close as they will ever come to being introduced. But with help from a stud finder, a laser level, a hammer and a handful of nails, they manage to keep company now on this 8-by-12-foot patch of blue wall. My mother and her grandsons are only inches apart from each other, and Frances, slightly above, presides over them, kind of classy in her own way and, for sure, eyeballing us all.  Still, there are no right angles in my old house, and none of the walls are plumb, so no matter how we tried to coerce order among these pictures, the grouping still seemed a little awry. Despite the arsenal of tools that promised absolute precision, nothing has quite managed to line up. At best, the portraits just kind of float contentedly in their improvisational closeness in the never-ending exercise of a family, probably any family, trying to find the order among its members.  I often step back and look at this gathering on the wall. There is no big picture, just as there are no strict rules about how a family composes itself. All of which, I suppose, is as it should be. Arranging these pictures on the wall was just another reminder of how difficult it is to understand the space between us; and how it is so rarely what we imagine or hope for.  HOME WORK",

Digital photography, in general, suffers from a more limited dynamic range than many types of film.  The Fujifilm FinePix S5 Pro is the second camera from Fuji that tries to improve on that record.  Like the S3 model it replaces (Fuji skipped over the S4), the S5 employs an unusual image-sensing chip. Each of its 6.17 million pixels has a secondary, smaller pixel to expand its light-gathering abilities. As a result, S5 users can expand the camera's dynamic range up to 400 percent in five increments. Alternatively, the camera's image processor can automatically choose the best level of expansion. With the earlier model, the feature was either just on or off.  The S5, which will be available next month for $2,000 without a lens, is otherwise very much like the Nikon D200 on which it is based. Fuji does include one novelty the Nikon lacks: software that analyzes images during playback to find faces and then enlarge them on the camera's rear monitor so you can see if someone blinked.

            "fulltext": "The Castle in the Forest  By Norman Mailer  477 pages. Random House. $27.95.  The wise beekeeper does not wear dark clothing, lest it pick up light-colored pollen. Italian bees are gentler and more chic than the Austrian variety. The mating box, capping fork and spur-wheel embedder are essential tools for apiculture. And all power in the beehive rests with a treacherous but fragrant bitch.  All this bee talk crops up in ''The Castle in the Forest,'' Norman Mailer's zzzzz-filled new novel about Adolf Hitler's tender, metaphor-fraught and (in this book's view) literally bedeviled boyhood. So it is not a stretch for the book's jacket copy to insist that ''now, on the eve of his 84th birthday, Norman Mailer may well be saying more than he ever has before.'' More about beekeeping -- absolutely.  Seldom is the banality of evil made this literal. In his first novel in a decade, Mr. Mailer has undertaken the ostensibly tough job of explaining Hitler's origins, then narrowed his attention to the nuts and bolts (talk about Freudian! And this book loves exclamation points!) of fractious family life.  He spies on the Hitler household by inserting a pantingly nosy narrator who poses as a Nazi Intelligence officer but claims to have been sent by the Devil. This observer, stiff and Viagran in prose style, is always eager to witness ''the most agreeable work of all -- that hard-breathing, feverish meat-heavy run up the hills of physical joy.''  Part demon, part actuary (or so it sounds when he speaks of his clients and budget), this narrator painstakingly analyzes Adolf Hitler's origins. He examines the implications of a doubly incestuous bloodline (which is not new speculation and is knottily complicated: it makes Adolf ''a First-Degree Incestuary One Step Removed.'') He leaves no stage of toilet-training unplumbed, finding much to work with in ''excretory dramas.''  As he puts it: ''As a devil, I am obliged to live intimately with excrement in all its forms, physical and mental. I know the emotional waste of ugly and disappointing events, the sour indwelling poison of unjust punishment, the corrosion of impotent thoughts, and, of course, I also have to engage caca itself.''  The narrator goes on to suggest (cue the bees) that young Adolf adapted the cruelty of the insect world to suit his own purposes and developed an iron will to thwart Alois Hitler, his overbearing father. For all the long-winded, claustrophobic intensity with which ''The Castle and the Forest'' dissects these matters, its conclusions turn out to have caca's sublety. With 467 pages of repetitive text, this is a big book with a jarring incongruity: its thinking is so small.  Long, monstrous story short: according to ''The Castle in the Forest,'' all the elements of classic Freudian character development were present during AdolfHitler's formative years. There were also certain kinks that made Hitler special. (Mr. Mailer loves these best.) By the time the novel leaves him, Hitler has been taught that some creatures must be extinguished so that others can survive, and that a terrified dog will still love its master. And his sister has told him that he ''just may not be a very good person.''  Little of this speculation is unexpected, despite the huge amounts of research implied by a lengthy bibliography. Freud, Jung, Milton, Wagner, Nietzche and ''Anna Karenina'' all helped Mr. Mailer conclude that Hitler's love (Mother) and hate (Father) relationships kindled his sympathy for the Devil. Although ''The Castle in the Forest'' does not bother with a discography, its built-in soundtrack blasts the Rolling Stones.  But this book is not strictly a character study. ''It is more than a memoir and certainly has to be most curious as a biography, since it is as privileged as a novel,'' the narrator explains, thus offering some idea of where its problems lie. In any case Mr. Mailer's casual insights are far sharper than his important ones. The weight of preparation might have numbed him, but the inherent ironies of ''The Castle in the Forest'' (with a title that turns out to be slyly ambiguous) can still bring out his gleeful side.  Sometimes Mr. Mailer can hammer home the obvious (''Alois saw bees as living a life with parallels to his own'') while still seeming to wink about his own heavy-handedness. At least it's best to hope that is what he's doing. To read a sentence like ''she sensed that the greatest provocation to her husband would be to comment on his pipe'' is to imagine a writer's cleverly pretending not to be clever -- and doing it with quite a bit of success.  When the narrator promises to spare the reader a description of a dinner that he then goes on to describe, the same kind of gamesmanship seems to be at play. Unfortunately, when Mr. Mailer suggests that the reader can skip a long foray into the Russia of Czar Nicholas II, he turns out to be giving good advice.  Tricky or not, ''The Castle in the Forest'' has Mr. Mailer's unmistakable hallmarks. They are hallmarks that, as ''The Naked and the Dead'' (1948) approaches a major anniversary, have been unmistakable for 60 years. The new book is lascivious, grandiose, cosmically critical (finding something Teutonic in technology and touting it as the Devil's own handiwork) and cantankerous, filled with grandstanding pronouncements on the nature of evil. About religious extremism, he writes: ''We love fundamentalists. Their faith offers us every promise of developing into the final weapon of mass destruction.''  The mass murderer Adolf Hitler is a child called ''Adi'' in this book. His menace comes alive only by implication. But his father, Alois Hitler, is true to his own father's ''tradition of apocalyptic intercourse in barn straw.'' His nature is as dangerous as his son's, but with one great difference: Alois is intoxicated by women. About Alois's connoisseurship of female anatomy, Mr. Mailer writes: ''This was as close as Alois ever came to admiring the Creator.''  Beleaguered, despotic, aggrieved, boastfully sensual and always ready to pontificate, Alois is yet another version of the devil Mr. Mailer knows.  BOOKS OF THE TIMES",

            "fulltext": "HOLLOW EARTH  The Long and Curious History of Imagining Strange Lands, Fantastical Creatures, Advanced Civilizations and Marvelous Machines Below the Earth's Surface.  By David Standish.  Illustrated. 303 pp. Da Capo Press. $24.95.  Jules Verne's ''Journey to the Center of the Earth,'' a survey of mid-19th-  century geological controversies thinly disguised as a ripping yarn set in a dinosaur-inhabited subterranean realm, was a best seller when it was first published in France in 1864. Five years later, an upstate New York alternative healer named Cyrus Teed had a vision revealing that the earth is hollow and that we're all living on its concave inner surface. He eventually renamed himself Koresh, and established a thriving colony of hollow-earthers in the wilds of Florida. Then, in 1871, ''The Coming Race,'' by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in which the narrator discovers an advanced civilization underground, helped give rise to dozens of science-fiction novels in which travelers penetrated the icy polar realms and descended into a well-lighted netherworld via a whirlpool or tunnel.  Where did the outlandish notion that the earth is hollow come from, and why did it capture the imagination of 19th-century Americans? In his entertaining new book, the journalist David Standish traces America's hollow-earth craze to one John Cleves Symmes, a St. Louis trader who in 1818 self-published a circular gravely announcing that ''the earth is hollow and habitable within; containing a number of solid concentric spheres, one within the other, and that it is open at the poles. ...'' The zone of ice near the poles, he argued, was merely a frozen ring surrounding a warm open sea leading to the interior.  The kookiest thing about Symmes's theory is how believable many found it. Not that it was without a semi-respectable scientific pedigree. As Standish recounts, several pioneering modern scientists and thinkers, including the English astronomer Edmond Halley, the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher and the Boston cleric Cotton Mather, had also advanced hollow-earth theories. (Since God would probably not have wanted to waste any space, Mather argued, an inhabitable hollow earth made perfect sense.)  Symmes was less persuasive as a scientist, however, than as an advocate for a national expedition to locate the polar opening. One of his converts, an Ohio newspaper editor named Jeremiah Reynolds, joined Symmes on his lecture tour and later embarked on a failed polar expedition. Reynolds's speeches and writings would in turn inspire the young Edgar Allan Poe to write ''Ms. Found in a Bottle,'' a career-launching story about a traveler sucked into an immense whirlpool at the South Pole. Poe later reprised the idea in ''The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym,'' which in turn inspired Jules Verne.  Standish's research is impressive, taking in everything from the British Enlightenment and American religious utopianism to such hollow-earth literature as Jacques Casanova's five-volume 1788 novel ''Icosameron'' (about a society of nudist hermaphroditic dwarves) to Edgar Rice Burroughs's Pellucidar novels, in one of which Tarzan descends into a ''Symmes's Hole'' via zeppelin. But his efforts to explain the popularity of hollow-earth-ism -- a Koreshan remnant survives today with the cult newsletter Hollow Earth Insider -- are weak. Standish rather lamely suggests it ''can be seen as a sort of ultimate metaphysical retreat to the womb.'' As for the proliferation of hollow-earth fiction from the 1870s on, it can be chalked up to the fact that writers needed ''somewhere to set improbable romances now that formerly remote, unknown corners of the earth were becoming less believable as settings the more they were explored.'' Ho-hum!  In the topsy-turvy America of the 19th century, in which the Civil War, industrialization, and urbanization caused all that was solid to melt into air (as a contemporary of Symmes put it), what could have made more sense than an inside-out world? Today, when utopian literature is so often dismissed as proto-totalitarian, we need dismissive explanations of hollow-earth mania like we need a Symmes's Hole in the head. If Standish's larger ideas are less than satisfying, it's not because he's wrong. It's only because we surface-dwellers have lost the capacity to imagine that another world is possible.

            "fulltext": "A TALE OF TWO LIONS  By Roberto Ransom.  Translated by Jasper Reid.  Illustrated. 114 pp.  W. W. Norton & Company. $19.95.  There are all sorts of books about lions. Accounts of lions who come to stay are always popular, as Joy Adamson discovered when she wrote ''Born Free'' and its sequels. These books succeed because the idea of sharing one's life with such a creature is, at some deep level, very appealing. Then there is writing in which lion imagery is used to make a point about the human rather than the leonine situation. In such a context, the lion is symbolic of vigor, of the masculine, of the untamable. Indeed, so burdened are lions with symbolism that it's surprising they manage to stagger even a few paces, let alone spring at their prey.  I came to ''A Tale of Two Lions,'' by the Mexican writer Roberto Ransom (translated by Jasper Reid, son of the well-known Scottish essayist and translator Alastair Reid), in a mood of enthusiastic anticipation, being well-disposed toward lions and their literary depiction. Ever since I read Russell Hoban's remarkable ''Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz'' some years ago, I have been looking for another piece of leonine magic realism.  Lion books need not be long, but they do need meat. And while Ransom's book is charming, it is perhaps a bit too brief to explore its theme of lions lost and found. Two main stories are brought together, to an extent, in a third, but ''A Tale of Two Lions'' is really just one long short story, or a shortish novella. The Thurberesque drawings that punctuate the book don't add a great deal to a story that, on its own, is perfectly engaging. There might also have been fewer pages of preliminaries, one of which bears a single sentence reminding us of the line used in old maps to fill unknown spaces: ''Here there are lions.'' (Perhaps this is a warning about the virtually blank pages we'll encounter later on?)  The first story takes the epistolary form and concerns a lion -- small enough to pass for a cat, but leonine in its exuberant habits -- that travels in an aircraft from Italy to the United States and then goes missing. In the next story, we are in a museum where a lion on display suddenly leaps out of an exhibit. (This is a lovely idea, and the relationship between the museum attendant and the lion is poignantly described.) Finally, we find ourselves in a circus, where the two lions meet. The first lion, Cattino, speaks Italian (a nice conceit), but all too soon both animals disappear. We are left wondering just who was who.  It's all very whimsical, but that, of course, is what a picaresque novel can be. Ransom's lions are elusive, and deliberately so: we see them, and then they appear to be something else; they are gone, yet they are somehow within us. It's like a half-remembered dream -- or an unexpected sighting of a real lion in the bush.  Alexander McCall Smith's most recent novel is ''The Right Attitude to Rain.''",

            "fulltext": "THE higher math of hanging pictures has always escaped me. The measurements of the space on one wall and two or four or seven pictures require a kind of visual algebra that I have no aptitude for.  There are rules, I know, but I can never quite remember them -- do you line up the frames from the bottom or from the top? They should be hung at eye level, I know, but whose eye? And should they be grouped or evenly spaced? Determining the correct amount of space between the pictures throws the calculations into ever greater confusion.  And then there are the structural issues of where to hang the hook. Once the most you could do was knock on the wall; when the sound changed, you knew you had hit on something solid -- with any luck, a stud that could support a nail and whatever was going to hang on it. If your house happens to conform to current construction standards, the studs are generally centered 16 inches apart, which makes it easy to determine where the supports are.  But if you still don't know, there are tools to help you. There is the stud finder, an electronic device outfitted with circuitry that is capable of detecting changes in material behind the surface it passes over; run it across a wall, and it beeps when it detects a stud.  Once the stud finder has located the studs in the wall, you can then use a laser level, a battery-operated device that shines a thin beam of light along the wall, eliminating the need to draw a line in pencil or otherwise mark the wall.  When it comes to the hanging itself, I had always thought traditional picture hangers to be sufficient. Even more dependable, I now learn, is the Hercules Hook, whose breathless ads on cable TV promise that it has the muscle to hang and hold up to 150 pounds. The hook has a curved rod of reinforced steel, sharpened at one end, that can simply be twisted, pushed and turned into the wall. Its curved form allows it to brace itself on the back of the wall, and it punctures the wall with surgical precision, leaving nothing but a pin-sized hole.  Despite having such tools available to me, when I finally faced the labored calculus of aligning the pictures and determining their appropriate proximity, I knew I was still without the most important tool of all, which was the intuition essential for such an endeavor. I called upon my friend and neighbor Myron Adams to help me. He has an instinctive knowledge about such things, some innate grasp of where things belong.  When I asked him how he came by this skill, he told me that his father, an architect, knew where everything was supposed to go. ''It seemed a little totalitarian,'' he said, ''but, in fact, it was very instructive.'' And as a teenager, Myron had once worked for an artist who hung her own paintings. ''She had no rules or tricks,'' he said. ''She was just a classy lady who knew how to eyeball things.'' Which, it occurred to me, would be a nice way to be remembered, and I became all the more determined to get the hang of it.  What with stud finders and Hercules Hooks, you might think hanging pictures is a high-testosterone enterprise that requires some kind of manly heft. That was not my experience. A different kind of stamina was called for, I found. Because for all the exacting tools at hand, it still remained an imprecise exercise. The calculations were made even more elusive by the fact that these were pictures of my family -- an old portrait of my great-great-grandmother Frances, who gazed down at us sternly across the distance the years have conferred on her; a watercolor of my mother that captured the tentativeness of her teenage years; and pastels of my sons when they were 10, staring out of their frames with the cheerful defiance that comes so naturally to young boys.  And then there was the question of those frames. Surrounding Frances is a heavy gilt frame with elaborate scrollwork; the portrait has a weight that might actually justify a Hercules Hook, if its name didn't seem like such an affront to her 19th-century reserve. A simple wood frame is around my mother, and with the boys the frames are more casual still. But for Myron, such visual inconsistency is cause for delight, just another sign of the generational disparity that makes life interesting. Almost effortlessly he managed to find a place on the wall for all of the portraits.  None of the subjects ever knew each other. My mother died long before her grandsons were born, so this is as close as they will ever come to being introduced. But with help from a stud finder, a laser level, a hammer and a handful of nails, they manage to keep company now on this 8-by-12-foot patch of blue wall. My mother and her grandsons are only inches apart from each other, and Frances, slightly above, presides over them, kind of classy in her own way and, for sure, eyeballing us all.  Still, there are no right angles in my old house, and none of the walls are plumb, so no matter how we tried to coerce order among these pictures, the grouping still seemed a little awry. Despite the arsenal of tools that promised absolute precision, nothing has quite managed to line up. At best, the portraits just kind of float contentedly in their improvisational closeness in the never-ending exercise of a family, probably any family, trying to find the order among its members.  I often step back and look at this gathering on the wall. There is no big picture, just as there are no strict rules about how a family composes itself. All of which, I suppose, is as it should be. Arranging these pictures on the wall was just another reminder of how difficult it is to understand the space between us; and how it is so rarely what we imagine or hope for.  HOME WORK",

            "fulltext": "EARLY AMIS: It's too soon to tell if Martin Amis's new novel, ''House of Meetings,'' reviewed on this week's cover, will climb onto the Times list in hardcover. The odds, historically speaking, are against it. Only two of Amis's books have appeared here, and just barely: his novel ''London Fields'' made the bottom of the list for one week in 1990, and ''Night Train,'' another novel, hung on for two weeks in 1998. ''House of Meetings'' is Amis's 19th book. His first, a novel called ''The Rachel Papers,'' was published in 1973, when Amis was 24. It did not receive a warm welcome in this newspaper. Writing in the Book Review, Grace Glueck described the book as a ''crotch-and-armpit saga of late adolescence'' that would probably not put Amis's father, the novelist Kingsley Amis, in a competitive mood. In the daily newspaper, Anatole Broyard wrote: ''Considering the advantages he has had, Martin has not covered himself with glory. Even allowing for his youth there is too much difference between his best and worst lines.'' Broyard went on to call Amis -- and this is not the kind of criticism a young novelist wants to hear -- a lousy writer about ''the minutiae of love.'' ''I find it difficult to imagine,'' Broyard added, by way of example, ''a room that 'smelled of breasts.' ''  NO OPINION: For more than two decades, the arrival of a new Amis book has been a genuine cultural event, both in England and the United States. Oddly, though, for the past three decades or so, none of Amis's books have been reviewed in this country's most austere and august literary journal, The New York Review of Books, according to a search of its electronic archives. Why not? Some have speculated it's because Amis, in 1980, accused Jacob Epstein -- son of the late Barbara Epstein, one of the review's editors -- of plagiarizing passages of ''The Rachel Papers'' in his own first novel, ''Wild Oats.'' (Amis observed at the time that ''Epstein wasn't influenced by 'The Rachel Papers,' he had it flattened out beside his typewriter.'') Epstein later admitted copying passages, and apologized. According to Robert Silvers, the editor of The New York Review, there is no Amis ban. ''We have sent previous books of his out for review,'' he said, ''but never received a review we could publish. It happens all the time.'' Silvers added that Amis's new novel will be reviewed in The New York Review of Books this month.  HORRORISM: Amis made news in Britain this fall not only for his new novel -- the London reviews were mixed -- but for an essay he published in The Observer, at around the time of the 9/11 anniversary, called ''The Age of Horrorism.'' In an interview on Australian television, Amis explained what he meant by the title. ''When you're on your sleigh going through Siberia and you hear a wolf howl, that is fear or concern. When the wolf is pounding after your vehicle, then that's terror, and horror is when the wolf is actually there. I think Islamism has turned up the dial of terror. This is an ideology that has freed itself from reason and it is feeding on death.''  DWIGHT GARNER  TBR",

It is always instructive to view Ms. Chast's captivating pen-and-ink drawings in the original rather than in a magazine reproduction because you can better appreciate the deftness of her short, squiggly lines; the marvelously abbreviated detail; and the luminosity of her colors. You might also witness mistakes and modifications; a few drawings here are stained with correction fluid, and others are patched with slivers of paper where the artist wanted to change bigger things.  The range usefully marshals a sense of how her drawings have changed stylistically; the early designs are usually minimal, black and white, and with an indefinite, conceptual link between the drawing and language elements. They tax the brain more than the eyes. By contrast, more recent drawings tend to confront, often very precisely, the humdrum trials of ordinary Americans coping with parenthood, work and growing old.  In a cartoon from 1998 titled ''Nancy Drew Mysteries: The Later Years,'' a confused elderly woman appears on a mock book cover asking herself: ''How did I gain eight pounds? I eat nothing!'' On another book cover, as she looks for keys, she says, ''I know I left them right there.''

            "fulltext": "KILLING JOHNNY FRY  A Sexistential Novel.  By Walter Mosley.  280 pp. Bloomsbury. $23.95.  t times in Walter Mosley's ''sexistential'' new novel, ''Killing Johnny Fry,'' it's unclear whether his hero, Cordell Carmel, is meant to be a lover or a big-game hunter. One of his conquests is described as bellowing ''like some large woodlands creature in ecstasy over the wild'' and flopping ''like a mackerel on the deck of a fishing boat.'' Manly and active to a fault, the descriptions Mosley favors for both Cordell's physical equipment and his talent with it might have been plucked from ''The Boys' Big Book of Phallic Metaphors.'' Cordell compares himself to ''a bullet'' entering ''the well-oiled chamber of a gun'' and ''a giant cruise ship coming into a port that was way too small.'' All that's missing is for Cordell to drop his drawers and have one of his partners inquire, ''Is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo?''  ''Killing Johnny Fry'' is a frankly pornographic novel, and I mean that as a compliment. It would be unfair to what Mosley is attempting here -- to put sex at the center of Cordell's existence and to turn the reader on in the process -- to describe the sex scenes with that wan word ''erotica,'' a word almost always used to demonstrate that the user is above those coarse enough to be aroused by mere pornography. And judged solely by its intentions to appeal to what prosecutors in obscenity cases used to call the prurient interest, the novel is a success. Good porn is tough to write and when talented writers decide it shouldn't be left to the hacks, the result can be something as joyous as Nicholson Baker's ''Vox'' and ''The Fermata.'' Or even something as voluptuously smutty as the porn-for-cash Alexander Trocchi turned out for Maurice Girodias's Olympia Press.  The story Mosley is telling here begins when Cordell, a translator, walks into his girlfriend Joelle's apartment and -- without her being aware of his presence -- finds her blissfully submitting to anal sex with an acquaintance of his named Johnny Fry. Fry is, to use a phrase Susan Faludi once quoted to describe a porn star, a life-support system for a penis. He is also the tormentor who sets Cordell on his sexual adventure. Cordell is hounded by the sight of Fry having sex with Joelle; by Fry's being better endowed than he is; and, just as generations of white men have been obsessed with white women having sex with black men, by the sight of Joelle with a white man. Deciding that everything about his life has been too safe, Cordell sets out not just to sleep with the women who cross his path, but to treat sex with them and with Joelle as a chance to strut his power and prowess. Impulsively, he also quits his job and decides to act as an agent for one of his new conquests, a young photographer whose specialty is genocide and starvation in Sudan. He also decides to murder Johnny Fry.  Any artist who tries to deal with sex graphically is almost inevitably accused of narrowing his or her outlook. And I can't imagine that ''Killing Johnny Fry'' won't provoke some of the disgust that has greeted far better novels that strip sex of its niceties (Philip Roth's ''Dying Animal'' comes to mind) and make the link between lust and feelings of power. Those are not attractive qualities, they are often male and Mosley shouldn't be condemned for trying to stay true to them. It should also be said that in ''Killing Johnny Fry,'' more than in many books that tackle this subject, the male protagonist here often submits to his partners, overwhelmed by sex as much as empowered by it.  The problem with this novel isn't that it's graphic or that Mosley uses the standard set-ups of pornography -- the horny neighbor, the girl picked up on the street. The problem is that it's silly. That there is an embarrassed (and embarrassing) quality to ''Killing Johnny Fry'' is no surprise. The violence that erupts in Mosley's Easy Rawlins detective novels often feels worked up, as if overblown descriptions of physical punishment were what the genre called for. (That white women are often the she-devils luring black men to their doom suggests Mosley takes some pulp fantasies too seriously.) There is something in Mosley that pulls back from the carnal madness Cordell gives himself over to, that presents it as the beginning of a journey toward redemption. Which makes Mosley something like a guy who's decided to hand out copies of ''The Watchtower'' at an orgy. The novel that ''Killing Johnny Fry'' most recalls is Norman Mailer's great and appalling ''American Dream,'' in which Mailer's protagonist, Rojack, confronts existential dread by indulging in murder and sex and the most insane macho daredevilry. But Mailer was inside that subject, feverishly so -- and because he so freely risked ridiculousness the book never felt ridiculous. Mailer wrote to make us feel that the fires of hell were a whisker away. Mosley stands by with the extinguisher.  Charles Taylor is a columnist for The Star-Ledger of Newark.",

However, far from a world with an all-powerful dictator at its head, the government in the novel is elected by a pool of individuals who, regardless of race or sex, have chosen to engage in military service. Such a government, essentially republican in character, compares quite favorably with the early American system, which limited the franchise based on all of these criteria, albeit replacing noble service with simple property ownership.  While many, myself included, would not choose to live in the world of ''Starship Troopers,'' Heinlein does prove prescient in providing insights into a question that has come to plague us: How does a society demonstrate that citizenship includes both rights and responsibilities? A shallow reader might imagine that he or she should take the world presented as a utopia. However, as in most of his greatest works, Heinlein's goal is to press us to think more deeply about our own societal limitations -- limitations in this case more evident now than back in Heinlein's day.

            "fulltext": "This summer, readers interested in American wealth will be able to pick up Robert Frank's new book -- and the other Robert Frank's new book.  Robert Frank, a reporter who covers private wealth for The Wall Street Journal, and Robert H. Frank, an economist and professor at Cornell University (who also contributes to The New York Times), have both written books dealing with the culture of wealth in the United States. Mr. Frank's ''Richistan: A Journey Through the American Wealth Boom and the Lives of the New Rich,'' will be published by Random House's Crown imprint in June, while Professor Frank's ''Falling Behind: How Rising Inequality Harms the Middle Class,'' will be published by the University of California Press in July.  Both writers, who are telephone acquaintances, sounded more amused than annoyed by the coincidental timing. ''If Robert Frank comes out with a book on economic inequality, it's going to be confusing,'' said Professor Frank, who said that people occasionally mistake him for the journalist. But, he added, the other Robert Frank ''is entitled to his name and any subject he wants to write about.''  Mr. Frank's regard for the professor goes beyond just his name. ''I'm a huge admirer of his work. I've read and loved every book that he's written,'' he said. ''He's a renowned and respected and highly trained economist, and I'm a mere journalist.''  The writers also rely on small distinctions to separate their public identities. ''I use my middle initial, so this helps,'' said Professor Frank, who has some experience sharing his name. (His literary agent also represents the photographer named, yes, Robert Frank.)  The journalist Mr. Frank, whose longtime byline is ''Robert Frank'' and whose middle initial is L., had considered using that initial with ''Richistan'' (early copies of the book's jacket have it). But he has now decided to publish the book without the initial, he said Friday. Both men also said that their books, while superficially related, were very different in tone and purpose. Mr. Frank described ''Richistan'' as a ''colorful and fun'' collection of stories about the lives and lifestyles of wealthy Americans. ''Falling Behind'' examines the pressures facing middle-class Americans as a result of uneven income gains.  Professor Frank's book already has its first endorsement -- from Mr. Frank, who has read a manuscript copy. ''I think his book is great and I hope people buy it,'' Mr. Frank said.

No team with a record as bad as the Saints' 3-13 last season had ever made the conference championship the next season. But here are the Saints, and, tailback Deuce McAllister said, ''This may be destiny.''  It may be many things, but two stand out:  Can the Bears' celebrated defense rise from the doldrums and handle McAllister, quarterback Drew Brees, the all-around threat Reggie Bush and those dangerous receivers?  Which Rex Grossman will show up at quarterback for the Bears?  Last week, Grossman was mostly good in an overtime victory against the Seahawks, and the Saints' secondary has been vulnerable to the long pass. Grossman was erratic during the regular season, with 23 touchdown passes and 20 interceptions. ''What's important is those players have a belief in him,'' Saints Coach Sean Payton said.  Although the Bears' defense has lost some of its dominance because of injuries, linebacker Lance Briggs said, ''We tweak a little, we're right back where we were.''  The Bears will have an advantage from a home crowd, and Chicago weather in January can be shocking to a dome team from a warm-weather city.  Reporter's Pick: Saints  New England (14-4) at Indianapolis (14-4)  6:30 p.m., CBS  History favors the Patriots. They have won three of the last five Super Bowls, Coach Bill Belichick is 13-2 in playoff games and quarterback Tom Brady is 12-1. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is 4-10 against the Patriots. In two playoff games this season, he has thrown one touchdown pass and five interceptions.  Or maybe history will favor the Colts in the American Football Conference title game. They beat the Patriots 11 weeks ago, when Brady threw four interceptions, and he threw three last week against the Chargers.  Still, the Patriots have won five straight games, and they always seem to come up with defensive innovations. They will need offensive fire because the Colts, who have suffered on defense all season, have turned into a defensive power.  Reporter's Pick: Patriots  PRO FOOTBALL",

They are small and versatile backs, and whoever has the better game will most likely be headed to the next round of the playoffs -- unless they cancel each other out, as they have done twice this season.

The Giants, under their new play-caller, Kevin Gilbride, have vowed to be more committed to the run.

            "fulltext": "AMERICAN FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  SEEDING --1  TEAM -- San Diego Chargers (West champions)  The Chargers have won 10 in a row, including the finale over Arizona to clinch home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs. If the seedings hold up, their first game could be a doozy: against New England, whose coach, Bill Belichick, would surely try to confuse quarterback Philip Rivers in his first playoff game, and whose solid run defense would give LaDainian Tomlinson one of his biggest challenges of the season.  RECORD -- 14-2  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 2  TEAM -- Baltimore Ravens (North champions)  Baltimore beat Buffalo yesterday, using its fifth interception return for a touchdown to secure the second seeding and a first-round bye. The Ravens have won four in a row and their offense has been energized since Brian Billick took over the play-calling. But a run in the playoffs will still be all about their top-rated defense. Baltimore held the Chargers to 13 points in October to hand San Diego its first loss.  RECORD --13-3  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 3  TEAM -- Indianapolis Colts (South champions)  The Colts held off the Dolphins yesterday to secure the third seeding, but the Dolphins, playing a meaningless game, moved down the field with ease late in the fourth quarter, a bad omen for Indianapolis. The defense is not as good as it was last year, and the Colts will go only as far as their porous run defense - the worst in the league - allows them. The Chiefs have a star running back in Larry Johnson, and that could mean another early exit for the Colts.  RECORD -- 12-4  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Kansas City  SEEDING -- 4  TEAM -- New England Patriots (East champions)  After an erratic season, the Patriots go into the playoffs on a roll after pounding Vince Young (five sacks, three turnovers) and the Titans yesterday. They remain an intimidating playoff opponent because of Tom Brady, who has had a superb season despite a dearth of receiver talent. But the Jets held the Patriots to 14 points in Foxborough in November.  RECORD -- 12-4  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Jets  SEEDING -- 5  TEAM -- Jets  The Jets defeated the Raiders yesterday to secure a wild-card spot, completing a remarkable rookie regular season for Coach Eric Mangini, who took over a team that won only four games last season. The Jets started looking like a serious threat when they beat the Patriots in Foxborough in mid-November. Now they are going back for another visit, another chance for Bill Belichick to offer Mangini a warm welcome back.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- New England  SEEDING -- 6  TEAM -- Kansas City Chiefs  The Chiefs snuck in when the Broncos lost to the 49ers in overtime yesterday and Pittsburgh beat Cincinnati. The Chiefs survived Trent Green's severe concussion in the season opener because they leaned heavily on running back Larry Johnson. Coach Herman Edwards will no doubt do that again when he faces his friend Tony Dungy's suspect run defense.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Indianapolis  NATIONAL FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  SEEDING -- 1  TEAM -- Chicago Bears (North champions)  The Bears wrapped up the top seeding long ago on the strength of their dominating defense, rendering last night's game against the Packers meaningless. But the Bears still have not answered the biggest question about a potential run to the Super Bowl: What happens if quarterback Rex Grossman struggles? It is a question that could shape the postseason for the N.F.C., especially if the Bears face the Saints, who have a top-five pass defense, in the conference championship game.  RECORD -- 13-3  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 2  TEAM -- New Orleans Saints (South champions)  The Saints, the feel-good story of the season, may also be the most dangerous team in the N.F.C., and after their decimation of the Giants in Week 15, everyone knows it. Drew Brees, Reggie Bush and Deuce McAllister rested for most of the Saints' meaningless loss to the Panthers yesterday. Bush versus Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher in the conference championship would be a blockbuster.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 3  TEAM -- Philadelphia Eagles (East champions)  The Eagles finished the season with five consecutive victories behind the backup quarterback Jeff Garcia, who has been so effective leading a balanced offense that Donovan McNabb's mother is worried about her injured son's future. The Eagles defeated the Giants, 36-22, just two weeks ago, and they seem to be getting stronger and more confident by the week. Their offense, improbably, is in the top five in the league.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Giants  SEEDING -- 4  TEAM -- Seattle Seahawks (West champions)  The Seahawks blew out the Buccaneers in their season finale, but they had lost three in a row before that. They are nowhere near the powerhouse team that went to the Super Bowl last season. And the final game was costly: Cornerback Kelly Herndon broke his left ankle (another cornerback, Marcus Trufant, didn't play because of a sprained ankle) and linebacker Leroy Hill sustained a concussion.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Dallas  SEEDING -- 5  TEAM -- Dallas Cowboys  Less than a month ago, the Cowboys had a two-game lead in the N.F.C. East and looked like the best team in the conference. But yesterday, with a chance to win the division, they lost to the Lions at home, their third loss in their final four games. Quarterback Tony Romo was voted into the Pro Bowl, but he has struggled in those three losses. Seattle's Qwest Field is one of the loudest, most difficult stadiums in the league. Seattle's secondary is injury-riddled, so the complaining Dallas receivers should get plenty of action.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Seattle  SEEDING -- 6  TEAM -- Giants  The Giants survived a near-complete collapse and rediscovered their offense to sneak into the playoffs with almost no momentum. They played the Eagles close for a while two weeks ago, but their defense was gashed up the middle by the Eagles' rushers. Earlier in the season, the Giants forged an epic comeback to beat the Eagles in Philadelphia. But that was a long time ago, and if they beat the Eagles next week, it will be an even greater comeback for the season.  RECORD -- 8-8  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Philadelphia  PRO FOOTBALL",

Manning will almost certainly own every passing record before he retires, but he is 5-6 in playoff games and is in danger of inching into Dan Marino's shoes as the best quarterback to never have won a Super Bowl.  In a conference call earlier this week, the former Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason said that if the Colts lose Sunday, Manning will be lumped into the same category as the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez: players who make the most money, but haven't won championships.  Colts Coach Tony Dungy arrived in Pittsburgh as a defensive back when Terry Bradshaw was winning Super Bowls for the Steelers, but he remembers when the jury was still out on Bradshaw. Manning, after nine years in the N.F.L., may be only halfway through his career.  \"I don't think you judge him until his career is over,\" Dungy said.",

            "fulltext": "A young, rebuilding Rutgers team might have learned something Wednesday night. It probably is not going to win a jump-shooting contest.  Against the Syracuse zone defense, Rutgers could do little else but shoot long-range jumpers, a strategy that failed. Hitting 18 of 61 shots (29.5 percent) from the field and scoring just 20 points in the paint, the Scarlet Knights were no match for Syracuse, losing by 68-58.  Only the reserve guard Courtney Nelson, who led Rutgers with 14 points, seemed to be in any rhythm for the Scarlet Knights (8-8, 1-2 Big East). But he made only 3 of 9 field-goal attempts.  ''I thought we did a good job of getting the ball inside, but, of course, any time you see a zone you've got to make shots,'' Rutgers Coach Fred Hill said. ''There are a lot of different ways to attack a zone, but you've got to make shots to loosen things up a bit. We got some great looks, but they didn't go down.''  The Orange (13-4, 2-1 Big East) offered a far more diverse attack. Shooting 46.9 percent, they got solid interior play from Darryl Watkins (9 points, 10 rebounds) and Demetris Nichols (12 points, 7 rebounds), as well as good perimeter shooting from guard Eric Devendorf, who led all scorers with 19 points.  ''These games are made for Eric,'' Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. ''Teams will go way out with their defense. That creates space for him to get to the basket.''  The Orange also helped itself at the free-throw line, making 18 of 21 attempts.  Rutgers was cold throughout, making 9 of 32 field-goal attempts during an opening half that ended with Syracuse leading, 28-25. Ten Syracuse turnovers helped Rutgers stay close.  The Orange got an immediate lift from an unlikely source. Guard Andy Rautins, who was averaging 5 points a game, scored 9 of Syracuse's first 11 points. He did not score again.  Syracuse took control early in the second half. A dunk by Nichols with 16 minutes 4 seconds left extended the lead to 39-30, and for Rutgers, it would only get worse. When Roberts dunked with 4:55 to go, the Orange had a 60-43 lead. Rutgers cut the deficit in the closing minutes, and when Marquis Webb scored on a putback with 54.4 seconds left, the lead was 6 points. Nichols responded by making a pair of free throws, and seconds later, Devendorf sealed the game by making two more free throws.  ''The shots weren't falling,'' Rutgers forward J. R. Inman said. ''It just wasn't outside. We were missing midrange and a lot of shots we usually hit. It was an adjustment for us. We haven't played a team that big down low. When you see a zone and with a lot of big, athletic guys, it's hard to adjust.''  The loss came just four days after Rutgers played what might have been its best game of the season, a 54-42 victory at Cincinnati. The 42 points were the fewest scored against Rutgers by a Big East opponent.  The Orange have beaten Rutgers six straight times, which includes an 86-84 overtime victory last season at the Carrier Dome. Three of Syracuse's four losses have come against teams that were ranked at the time.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL",

            "fulltext": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass., Jan. 18 -- If the New England Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts and advance to the Super Bowl, it will be a milestone for their 43-year-old backup quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, who has never reached the Super Bowl in 20 N.F.L. seasons.  \"Every year I watch it, I think, 'Got away from me again,' \" Testaverde said. \"Hopefully, this year will be a little different.\"  The chance to win the Super Bowl, and another chance to play for Bill Belichick, lured Testaverde out of a brief retirement when he signed with the Patriots on Nov. 14 as a backup to Tom Brady. Testaverde's main role is to offer advice and encouragement as a stable presence in a locker room already loaded with experience.  The quarterback duel between Brady and Peyton Manning will be a dominant theme during Sunday's American Football Conference championship game, and Brady has the upper hand, with three Super Bowl titles and two playoff victories over Manning.  Because of those losses, and his failure to reach the Super Bowl, Manning has been targeted for criticism despite a brilliant career. But Testaverde finds it hard to fathom that Manning does not have the makeup to lead a team to a championship,  \"I don't know Peyton personally as well as I do Tom, but I think from what I've seen, he has a lot of the same instincts and ability as Tom does,\" Testaverde said. \"He's obviously one of the best. A lot of people don't give him as much credit as he deserves, because he hasn't won the big game yet. It's more than one player when it comes to winning in this sport. A guy as good as he is, sooner or later, he's going to get one, he's going to get a ring.\"  Though Testaverde barely played this season, a personal high point occurred Dec. 31, when he threw a touchdown pass to Troy Brown during the Patriots' 40-23 victory over Tennessee. The pass was completed with less than two minutes left in the game, and some Titans were not happy. But Belichick wanted Testaverde to become the first N.F.L. player to throw touchdown passes in 20 consecutive seasons, and Testaverde appreciated the opportunity.  \"I didn't expect to go in the game at that point, and then when I did, I really didn't think we were going to be throwing the football,\" Testaverde said. \"That situation shows that he does have a sense of history. He lets the team know the accomplishments of certain guys, because guys are proud to be a part of it, too.\"  Even if the Patriots win the Super Bowl, Testaverde did not guarantee that he would retire -- again.  \"This is what I love to do,\" he said. \"I can't think of anything better, and this is a great situation.\"  FOUR PATRIOTS ARE AILING At least four Patriots had flu symptoms Thursday, three days before New England takes on Indianapolis in the A.F.C. championship game.  Receiver Troy Brown, linebacker Tedy Bruschi, offensive tackle Ryan O'Callaghan and defensive tackle Mike Wright were ailing, but all were expected to be available for Sunday's game.  The hard-hitting safety Rodney Harrison, one of New England's key defensive players, was on the field at the beginning of Thursday's practice, although he missed the previous two playoff games with a knee injury. His status for Sunday was uncertain. Only the beginning of practice was open to the news media, so it was not known how much Harrison participated.",

            "fulltext": "Penn State (8-4) vs. Tennessee (9-3)  Outback Bowl, Tampa, Fla., 11 a.m., ESPN  The possible return of Penn State Coach Joe Paterno to the sideline will be the dominant story line in this battle between two traditional powers.The 80-year old Paterno fractured his shinbone and tore two knee ligaments in during a loss at Wisconsin in November. He'll return for his 22nd New Year's Day Bowl game. He enters with a 15-6 record. Tennessee, which did not play in a bowl game last season, is looking for a chance to put an exclamation point on a recovery year.  Auburn (10-2) vs. Nebraska (9-4)  Cotton Bowl, Dallas, 11:30 a.m., Channel 5  Auburn, which beat Florida and Louisiana State, could be the best team not playing in a Bowl Championship Series game. Auburn is 32-5 the past three seasons. Only Southern California and Texas have been better. For Nebraska, this game provides another chance to show that the program is inching back toward prominence under Bill Callahan. The Cornhuskers won the Big 12 North for the first time since 1999, and their 9-4 record is the best since Callahan took over as the coach three years ago.  Wisconsin (11-1) vs. Arkansas (10-3)  Capital One Bowl, Orlando, Fla., 1 p.m., Channel 7  You may not see two better young tailbacks on the field at the same time all season. The Arkansas sophomore tailback Darren McFadden will be a heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy next season after rushing for 1,558 yards and 14 touchdowns. McFadden, who often lines up at quarterback to confuse defenses, has also thrown three touchdowns passes. Wisconsin features the freshman star P.J. Hill, who led the Big Ten with 1,533 yards and 15 touchdowns. Hill is the latest in a long line of plodding but powerful Badgers backs.  Georgia Tech (9-4) vs. West Virginia (10-2)  Gator Bowl, Jacksonville, Fla., 1 p.m., Channel 2  The Yellow Jackets will be without their senior quarterback Reggie Ball because of academic reasons. Tech fans who have watched Ball flutter passes for four seasons may think that's a good thing. Two November losses ended West Virginia's national title hopes. Look for a blowout win today to fuel the hype for the Mountaineers to be a title favorite next season. It will be interesting to see, however, how an underrated Tech defense can handle West Virginia's dangerous spread attack.  Southern California (10-2) vs. Michigan (11-1)  Rose Bowl, Pasadena, Calif., 5 p.m., Channel 7  Both teams have been persistent in saying it is not a letdown to play in the Rose Bowl. If that is true, this could be the best game of the bowl season. Southern California is out to prove that its offensive gridlock against U.C.L.A. was a fluke. Michigan clearly has a better defense than the Bruins, who followed their upset of the Trojans by being trounced by a mediocre Florida State team in the Emerald Bowl. The Wolverines are coming off a 42-39 loss at Ohio State, but they appear to have more talent that the Trojans.  Boise State (12-0) vs. Oklahoma (11-2)  Fiesta Bowl, Glendale, Ariz., 8 p.m., Channel 5  After Rhett Bomar was booted from the team in August, the referees robbed Oklahoma of a September game at Oregon and Adrian Peterson broke his collarbone in October, things could have fallen apart for the Sooners. Instead, they have put together perhaps the most impressive season in the Bob Stoops era, considering the circumstances. Peterson is expected to return for the game. They will face an undefeated Boise State team that is getting its first crack at an elite team since losing, 48-13, at Georgia to open last season. If Boise, from the Western Athletic Conference, pulls off the upset and completes an undefeated season, it will cap one of the most surprising seasons in recent college football history.

            "fulltext": "In trying to create a brighter future for quarterback Eli Manning, Giants Coach Tom Coughlin continues to reach into his own past.  In 1997, Coughlin, then the coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, hired Chris Palmer as his offensive coordinator. Palmer replaced Kevin Gilbride, who had taken the head-coaching position with the San Diego Chargers.  Coughlin has made a similar move now, hiring Palmer as the Giants' quarterbacks coach to replace Gilbride, who was elevated to offensive coordinator. An announcement is expected today.  Palmer, 57, spent last season as the quarterbacks coach for the Dallas Cowboys, who changed to the inexperienced quarterback Tony Romo from the veteran Drew Bledsoe at midseason, with good results.  Palmer was the offensive coordinator of the Jaguars in 1997 and 1998. In 1997, Mark Brunell led the American Football Conference in passer rating and was named to the Pro Bowl.  In 1999, Palmer became the coach of the expansion Cleveland Browns. He was fired after two seasons; quarterback Tim Couch, chosen with the first overall pick in the 1999 draft, struggled to live up to expectations.  From 2002 to 2005, Palmer was the offensive coordinator of the Houston Texans, helping develop another No. 1 overall pick, quarterback David Carr.  The tie between Palmer and Gilbride runs deep. Each played quarterback at Southern Connecticut State -- Palmer graduated in 1972, two years before Gilbride. Both are in the university's Sports Hall of Fame.  Palmer's first coaching experience in the N.F.L. was as the receivers coach for the Houston Oilers from 1990 to 1992. Gilbride was the team's offensive coordinator.  The Giants were 8-8 in 2006 and lost six of their final eight regular-season games. They made the National Football Conference playoffs as a wild-card team, but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round.  Before the final regular-season game, Coughlin stripped the offensive coordinator John Hufnagel of his responsibilities and handed them to Gilbride.  Manning, the first choice in the 2004 draft, was inconsistent most of the season and showed few signs of progress from the previous season.  ''I've only had one quarterbacks coach in the N.F.L.,'' Manning said during a conference call Thursday when asked about his ideal coach. ''I'm just looking for someone who's obviously smart, intelligent. Someone who we can have a good relationship and just really communicate well together and be on the same page with things. Someone who has good drills and is going to be hard on me and coach me and make sure that everything that I'm doing, I'm doing to get better.''  PRO FOOTBALL",

            "fulltext": "Patriots Put a Stop to the Titans' Run  Corey Dillon ran for two touchdowns and Tom Brady threw for one as the Patriots defeated the Titans, 40-23, dashing Tennessee's hopes for a playoff spot. The host Titans (8-8) had won six games in a row and needed to beat the Patriots and hope the Jaguars, Bengals and Broncos lost. All three did, but the Titans proved no match for the Patriots (12-4), who will play the Jets in a wild-card game Sunday.  With New Orleans (10-6) set to play host to its first playoff game in the rebuilt Superdome in two weeks, Coach Sean Payton removed several key players early in the Saints' 31-21 loss to the visiting Panthers. Quarterback Drew Brees played only one full series and was 4 of 5 for 46 yards. Reggie Bush rushed for an early touchdown but played little more than a quarter, and running back Deuce McAllister had the day off. Carolina finished 8-8.  Shaun Alexander rushed for 92 yards and scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter as the Seahawks defeated the Buccaneers, 23-7. Visiting Seattle (9-7) had little to play for after clinching the National Football Conference West title; they will play host to Dallas in the first round Saturday. Tampa Bay finished 4-12.  Chargers and Ravens Finish 1-2 in A.F.C.  Philip Rivers threw two touchdown passes after spraining his right foot, and LaDainian Tomlinson also limped off after wrapping up his first rushing title as the Chargers defeated the visiting Cardinals, 27-20. The Chargers (14-2), who have won 10 in a row, clinched home-field advantage throughout the American Football Conference playoffs. Rivers and Tomlinson, who had one of his legs stepped on, said they would have played if the result had been more important, but the Chargers had already earned a first-round bye. Tomlinson ran for 66 yards, giving him 1,815 this season. Arizona finished 5-11.  Using a stellar performance from the defense and an efficient effort from the offense, the Ravens beat the Bills, 19-7, to earn the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C. Chris McAlister returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown and the host Ravens (13-3) allowed only 39 yards rushing. Buffalo finished 7-9.  Colts Finish Strong, but Cowboys Do Not  Peyton Manning threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score as the Colts held on to beat the visiting Dolphins, 27-22. Manning's two scoring passes gave him 275 in his career, moving him ahead of Joe Montana into seventh on the career list. Indianapolis (12-4), which blew a chance to earn a first-round bye by losing four times in the previous six weeks, will play host to Kansas City in a wild-card game Saturday. Cleo Lemon was solid in his first N.F.L. start for Miami (6-10), finishing 18 of 36 for 210 yards.  Done in by repeated mistakes from quarterback Tony Romo and a few more by cornerback Terence Newman, the Cowboys lost To the visiting Lions, 39-31, and blew their chance to stay alive in the N.F.C. East race. ''I can't tell you how disappointed I am, I really can't,'' Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells said. As much as Dallas (9-7) wanted to win the game, Detroit (3-13) might have been better off losing it. By winning, they gave the Raiders the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. But even the Lions could not refuse the gifts the Cowboys gave them, from a penalty on Newman that wiped out an interception return for a touchdown on the game's first snap to Romo's two fumbles and an interception.  In Other Games  Steven Jackson had a career-high 4 touchdowns and 142 yards rushing, helping the visiting Rams defeat the Vikings, 41-21. Jackson's 59-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter prevented Minnesota (6-10) from establishing a postmerger N.F.L. record for fewest yards rushing allowed in a season. They missed by 15 the mark of 970 yards set by the Ravens in 2000. The Rams finished 8-8.  Despite losing running back Ron Dayne (ankle) and tight end Jeb Putzier (broken foot) to injuries in pregame warm-ups, the Texans defeated the visiting Browns, 14-6. Houston (6-10) won back-to-back games for the first time since 2004 and tripled its victory total from last season. Cleveland finished 4-12.  PRO FOOTBALL",

            "fulltext": "After the New England Patriots throttled the Jets on Sunday, 37-16, someone asked Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi if the Patriots took their game to another level during the playoffs.  ''The next level to us is the Super Bowl,'' he said. ''And we haven't been there in a while.''  A while? The Patriots won their most recent Super Bowl title two seasons ago. Only one championship has been decided since then, and it went to the Pittsburgh Steelers.  ''That's a while to me,'' Bruschi said.  So it is these days in New England, where a trip to the Super Bowl is a rite of winter. But this winter will be a bit longer for the Patriots if they are to reach their fourth Super Bowl in six seasons. In their three title runs, they did not have to take the long way. The Patriots had first-round byes and needed only two victories, the first at home, to make it to the Super Bowl.  Last season, when the Patriots had to play a first-round game, they beat the Jaguars. The next week, they lost to the Broncos in Denver, 27-13. Of course, the Steelers won the Super Bowl after winning three playoff games on the road.  The Patriots were 12-4 this season, but that earned them only the fourth seeding in the American Football Conference. And their victory over the Jets set up a meeting with the San Diego Chargers, an opponent that no team wants. The Chargers have a 10-game winning streak and are unbeaten at home. The Patriots, as the lowest-seeded team remaining, cannot be the host for the A.F.C. championship game.  The Patriots were 7-1 on the road, with their only loss a 21-0 shocker at Miami.  But none of their previous road opponents had the offensive firepower that the Chargers possess. The game presents excellent matchups. The up-and-coming quarterback Philip Rivers against Tom Brady, the best playoff quarterback in the game. Brady will also go against one of the best pass rushers in the game, Shawne Merriman. Chargers tight end Antonio Gates matches against whatever combination of defenders have to chase him.  The biggest matchup will be the Patriots' front seven, the best in the league, against Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson, the N.F.L.'s most valuable player. Tomlinson, who was also named offensive player of the year, rushed for 1,815 yards and 28 touchdowns this season.  ''He's explosive,'' cornerback Asante Samuel said of Tomlinson. ''If you sit back, he'll gas you like he does everyone else.''  Chargers Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who has notably failed in previous postseasons, goes up against Bill Belichick, perhaps the best coach of his era. Still, this is the most balanced team Schottenheimer has ever had, and he has said that Tomlinson is the best running back ever to play in the league. Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork called the Chargers ''hands-down the best team in the N.F.L.''  Tomlinson has faced the Patriots only three times since he came into the league in 2001, but he has turned in memorable performances, averaging 141.7 yards. In 2002, he ran for 217 yards and 2 touchdowns. Last season, he had 134 yards and 2 touchdowns as the Chargers scored 24 unanswered points in the second half to win, 41-17. Samuel remembered feeling as if a professional team were playing a college team in that game, with a sense of hopelessness that the Patriots rarely have.  ''He killed us last year,'' Belichick said Monday. ''We're usually looking at the back of his jersey. We haven't done very well against him. He's killed a lot of people besides us, and he's killed us. A team might keep him down for a few carries, but it's just a matter of time before he breaks out, in one way or another, and gets in the end zone.''  The Patriots had the fifth-best run defense in the league this season (they were 12th against the pass and 6th over all), but the perception is that the Patriots lack tremendous speed among their linebackers, a potential liability against Tomlinson. The Jets, who did not have much of a running game, used the speedy Leon Washington to slash through the Patriots' defense. He averaged 4.5 yards while being defended by Bruschi, although he had only 11 carries.  Safety Rodney Harrison, who is critical to holding off a multipronged offensive attack, missed the game against the Jets because of a right knee injury sustained in the regular-season finale against the Titans. On Monday, Belichick said Harrison was day to day and would not say if he would be available Sunday.  In their most successful seasons, the Patriots relied on Harrison in the playoffs to disrupt an explosive offense -- usually that of the Colts and Peyton Manning -- with his hard hits and intensity. Manning and the Colts play the Ravens on Saturday in Baltimore. On Sunday, perhaps without Harrison, New England again faces the most dangerous offensive player, this time in Tomlinson.

The Mets had made it clear that they had little interest in re-signing Floyd, 34, who is known for his powerful bat and upbeat personality. Floyd was hindered by injuries in his four years with the Mets. He played only 97 games last season, hitting .244 with 11 home runs and 44 runs batted in.  The Chicago Sun-Times first reported the deal yesterday.  Floyd will return to his native Chicago to play for a team that struggled for the past two seasons. The Cubs, however, hired Lou Piniella as manager and signed Alfonso Soriano as a free agent this off-season. With Derrek Lee, Aramis Ram\u00edrez and Soriano, the Cubs are loaded with powerful right-handed hitters. The addition of the left-handed Floyd would give Piniella more flexibility with his lineup. Floyd would probably share time in left field with Matt Murton.  Floyd, who spent time on the disabled list last season because of ankle and Achilles' tendon injuries, returned to the Mets at the beginning of September. He caught the last out of their division-clinching game against the Florida Marlins on Sept. 18.  The Mets signed Moises Alou to a one-year contract Nov. 20. Alou, who played right field in 81 of his 98 games with San Francisco last season, will probably fill Floyd's spot in left.",

            "fulltext": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The snap was there, the hold was good and the kick was perfect.  David Akers hit a 38-yard field goal with no time remaining to give the Philadelphia Eagles a 23-20 victory over the New York Giants in a wild-card playoff game on Sunday.  A day after Dallas lost to Seattle when quarterback Tony Romo fumbled the hold on what could have been a go-ahead field goal, the Eagles executed a seemingly routine play that has cost teams important games in recent weeks.  Brian Westbrook had 141 yards rushing, including a spectacular, slashing 49-yard TD run in the second quarter. His 65-yard punt return for an apparent score in the third quarter was nullified by a penalty on rookie Torrance Daniels.  Jeff Garcia threw for 153 yards, one touchdown and played efficiently enough to win for the sixth time in seven starts since replacing an injured Donovan McNabb.  Eli Manning threw two touchdown passes to Plaxico Burress, including an 11-yard strike that tied it at 20 with 5:03 left.  In what probably was his last game, Tiki Barber ran for 137 yards for the Giants. A three-time Pro Bowl running back, Barber plans to retire after 10 seasons in the NFL.  The Eagles are far from finished, though.  Counted out after a knee injury ended Donovan McNabb's season in Week 11, the Eagles (11-6) have won six straight games. They'll play at New Orleans (10-6) next Saturday night.  The Giants overcame a second-and-30 on their tying scoring drive as Manning completed consecutive passes of 18, 14 and 11 yards to Burress.  But the Eagles drove right down the field, mixing in short passes and Westbrook runs. That set up Akers' winning kick.  Led by Garcia and a rejuvenated defense, Philadelphia turned it around after a 24-point loss in Indianapolis, captured its fifth division title in six years and earned the No. 3 seed in the conference.  Meanwhile, the dysfunctional Giants (8-9) fell apart after a 6-2 start. They lost four in a row and six of seven before a win at Washington last week put them in the playoffs.  While the Eagles moved within one victory of their fifth trip to the NFC championship game in six years, the Giants face an uncertain offseason. Coach Tom Coughlin might not be back, Barber is retiring and the embattled Manning probably will hear more criticism after failing to win a playoff game for the second straight year.",

The service, which should be in operation by the end of March, will consist of eight channels and will include popular shows from NBC, CBS, Fox and MTV, they said. ESPN is reportedly also in negotiations to offer programs, which will be offered for the cellphone screen soon after they appear on television.  What is significant is that the programs will be among the first full-length television shows to be offered to cellular subscribers in the United States. In Europe, where mobile phone technology is more advanced, such programming is more widely available.  It will also make the mobile phone more competitive with devices like the iPod from Apple Computer. In 2005, Apple announced that it would offer shows from the Walt Disney Company's ABC network for sale through its iTunes Store. Other entertainment companies quickly followed suit.  Media companies will receive a fee based on consumer subscriptions. A spokesman for Verizon Wireless could not be reached for comment on Friday evening.  In the deal, Verizon is joining with MediaFLO U.S.A., a subsidiary of Qualcomm, which has created technology to transmit high-resolution video through its own dedicated network. MediaFLO's quality rivals European and Asian standards, media executives say.  Verizon Wireless and Qualcomm have been partners for some time; they first announced an agreement to work together in 2005. MediaFLO was reported by those apprised of the Verizon deal to be in talks to offer television shows through other wireless phone companies as well.

Orbitz's parent company, Travelport, has hired the investment bank UBS to explore an initial public offering for the subsidiary, according to a person briefed on the plan.  Travelport hopes to hold an offering for Orbitz in the second quarter and is considering listing the shares on the New York or London stock exchanges, this person said, adding that it expected to sell about a third of Orbitz's equity at a price that could value the entire business at $2.5 billion to $3 billion.  Orbitz, which allows customers to find and book airline and hotel reservations online, was part of the publicly traded Cendant until August, when a private buyout firm, the Blackstone Group, took Travelport private for $4.3 billion in cash. The sale was part of Cendant's split into four companies, which resulted in Cendant's being renamed the Avis Budget Group.  In addition to Orbitz, Travelport owns Galileo, a reservation-booking service for travel agents and corporations, and Gullivers Travel Associates, a wholesaler. Travelport recently agreed to buy Worldspan, a service that competes with Galileo, in a $1.4 billion deal.  Travelport's business-to-consumer segment, which includes Orbitz and CheapTickets, reported net revenue of $193 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 -- about 30 percent of Travelport's total revenue during the period.  A spokesman for Travelport declined to comment on the potential Orbitz offering.  Orbitz competes with consumer travel sites like Expedia, which was spun off from IAC/InterActiveCorp as a public company in 2005, and Travelocity, which is owned by Sabre Holdings.  Late last year, two private equity firms, Silver Lake Partners and the Texas Pacific Group, agreed to take Sabre private for $4.3 billion.  Cendant paid $1.25 billion in cash for Orbitz in November 2004. At the time, Orbitz was publicly traded but controlled by an alliance of major airlines that created it.",

            "fulltext": "Only weeks after closing its deal for BellSouth, AT&T is embarking on an ambitious strategy to show customers the benefit of its owning 100 million phone lines.  In an announcement expected Friday, AT&T will introduce AT&T Unity, a pricing package that allows its cellular customers to call any AT&T landline customer without incurring additional usage fees or using their wireless minutes. While AT&T wireless customers can already call each other free, the new plan will extend the program on a large scale to landline customers, enlarging what AT&T likes to call its ''community.''  ''I think it's a very significant development,'' said Mark A. Winther, a telecommunications analyst with IDC, a technology consulting firm. ''It's taking the emphasis away from price and putting it on the value of being part of the community.''  Mr. Winther said the package would probably appeal to high-volume customers, both in the consumer market and in small businesses, not to the shopper looking for the lowest monthly rate. The plans apply only to AT&T wireless packages starting at $59.99 for 900 anytime minutes a month.  To subscribe to a AT&T Unity plan, a customer would need to have AT&T wireless service as well as a landline plan that offered unlimited local and long-distance service. AT&T's unlimited local and long-distance landline service starts at $40 a month if bought online.  The pricing plan comes weeks after AT&T closed its $85.8 billion acquisition of BellSouth, the largest telecommunications merger in history. With the merger, AT&T became the sole owner of Cingular Wireless, and on Monday the company dropped the Cingular brand in favor of the AT&T name. AT&T previously owned 60 percent of Cingular, and BellSouth owned 40 percent. The combined company offers wireless and landline service in 22 states.  ''This is the first of many products that are going to come out of the AT&T-BellSouth merger,'' said Ralph de la Vega, group president of regional wireline operations for AT&T, of San Antonio.  Mr. Winther said other carriers would probably try to respond with new bundling options, but that AT&T would have an advantage because of its large coverage area.  Other wireless carriers, like T-Mobile with its myFaves option, already allow customers to call landline numbers free, but those are typically restricted to a handful of designated numbers. AT&T's strategy is a logical step in telecommunications marketing, Mr. Winther said, following on the popularity of bundled packages that combine phone, broadband and cable services on one bill.",

            "fulltext": "After falling behind Google in Internet search and advertising, Yahoo is trying to remain No. 1 in the battle to deliver information and online services to mobile phones.  Yahoo's latest weapon is software that will let users find information like weather, news, stock quotes and sports scores more quickly on their cellphones. The software, called Go for Mobile 2.0, was unveiled Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, just as Google announced a partnership to put its own mobile software on Samsung cellphones.  Internet services on mobile phones remain a tiny market today, especially in the United States. But industry analysts and Internet companies believe they will eventually outgrow the market for computer-based Internet services as the capabilities of cellphones and the bandwidth of wireless networks improve rapidly.  ''We view the mobile Internet today as entering an era where the PC-based Internet was in '96 or '97,'' said Steve Boom, Yahoo's senior vice president for broadband and mobile. ''It is just on the cusp of taking off.''  For Yahoo, securing a leading position in that market is especially important. The company has struggled over the last year, as Google solidified its lead in search and leaped ahead in online video by acquiring YouTube. Yahoo has also been criticized as lacking initiative and being slow to capitalize on Internet trends like social networking, now dominated by MySpace and Facebook.  Yahoo's introduction of mobile software was reported Monday in The Wall Street Journal. The software, a revamped version of technology that the company introduced last year, makes it easy to move among various online services providing news, sports scores, maps, weather, movies, photos and e-mail. The free ad-supported services will be tailored to match a user's settings, like ZIP code and stock preferences, on Yahoo's existing online services.  The software will also be equipped with a search service, oneSearch, that will interpret a user's intent and deliver results accordingly. For instance, when a user searches for a sports team, the service will make a bet that the user is interested in the latest scores, a team profile and news related to the team, and return those first. More general Web links, like those returned in typical Internet searches, will be de-emphasized.  ''It's the kind of thing that Yahoo very much needs to extend further onto the mobile platform,'' said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm based in Bethesda, Md.  The service is already available on about 70 handset models and is expected to be on some 400 devices by the end of the year, Mr. Boom said. Yahoo has signed agreements with handset makers to preload or distribute the software. Yahoo is also encouraging users to download the software directly onto their devices.  Yahoo's mobile services were used by 6.8 percent of cellphone users in the United States in October, according to Telephia, a research firm. That made Yahoo, whose most popular wireless service is e-mail, the No. 1 mobile Internet company. But in mobile search, Google already tops Yahoo, according to Telephia.  Google said its cellphone search, e-mail and map products would be preloaded on Samsung phones. Deep Nishar, Google's director of wireless products and strategy, said the company's mobile search service already emphasized results that users typically want, like sports scores and movie times and locations.  To succeed, both companies will need to secure cooperation from wireless carriers, which could prove a challenge for some time as several offer competing services, said Julie Ask, an analyst at Jupiter Research.  Yahoo said some overseas carriers had agreed to support its services. Mr. Boom said it was ''a matter of time'' before American carriers followed suit. As an incentive, Yahoo is offering to share revenue from any advertising on the system, he said.  Ms. Ask noted that, for now, most cellphone advertising consists of text messages sent directly to users, and that ad revenues from mobile search and Web browsing are minuscule.",

Downloads from file-sharing networks are generally free, and have long occurred outside the control of copyright holders. The cost of for-pay downloads, about 90 percent of which go through iTunes, generally includes a licensing fee.  But not many of the freeloaders are actually downloading mainstream content, according to the new data on downloading, which was gathered by the NPD Group, a consumer-research firm, through tracking software installed in 12,500 households. Only about 20 percent of the videos downloaded from file-sharing networks were TV shows, and 5 percent were mainstream movies, while just under 60 percent were pornographic movies.  The relative scarcity of pirated movie downloads may have more to do with legal and business pressure than with users' tastes. Many file-sharing networks are struggling to find accommodation with the movie and recording industries; for example, BitTorrent, a service whose software is on about 80 million computers, struck a deal in 2005 with the Motion Picture Association of America to remove infringing content from the search index on its Web site.

In September, the Times Company announced that it would sell its Broadcast Media Group as it refocused its strategy on its newspaper and digital businesses. The deal, expected to close in the first half of this year, comes as the Times Company and other newspaper companies struggle to maintain advertising revenue and circulation.  ''Our focus now should be on the development of our newspapers and our rapidly growing digital businesses and the increasing synergies between them,'' Janet L. Robinson, president and chief executive of the Times Company, said yesterday in a statement.  Oak Hill Capital Partners, which was founded in the 1980s by Robert M. Bass and others, does not own other media assets. It is one of several private equity firms that have expressed interest in media properties lately.  Advertising revenue and circulation growth have suffered at the Times Company recently, as they have with many other newspaper companies, as consumers spend more time on the Internet. The company owns The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune as well as 15 local newspapers, 35 Web sites and 2 New York City radio stations.  Total ad revenue for the Times Company has been down more than 3 percent every month since July compared with the same month in the previous year, reversing gains in the earlier months of 2006. As of November, ad sales were down 0.8 percent for the first 11 months of the year compared with the period in 2005.  The Times Company reported in early December that its companywide ad sales were down 3.8 percent in November from November 2005.  Times Company stock closed at $23.34 yesterday, down about 14 percent from a year ago.  In late December, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating for the Times Company's long-term corporate debt from A- to BBB+.  The Times Company increased the prices that subscribers to The New York Times pay by 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 and increased the price of its Sunday papers in the Northeast. The price increases are expected to produce about $12 million in additional revenue a year.  The broadcast group has been a profitable part of the Times Company. The nine TV stations generated $139 million in revenue in 2005, about 4 percent of total revenue, and, according to a forecast issued in September, are expected to account for about $150 million in 2006, helped by political ad spending.  The Times Company acquired the nine stations, which have 900 employees, over the last 35 years, beginning with a station in Memphis in 1971. The company most recently acquired a station in Oklahoma City in 2005. Four of the stations are affiliated with CBS, two with NBC, two with ABC and one with My Network TV, which is owned by the News Corporation.  The Times Company is also selling one of its radio stations, WQEW, to ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, for $40 million. That deal is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.",

            "fulltext": "AOL said Monday that it had agreed to buy TradeDoubler, a Swedish company that matches Internet advertisers with online media owners and e-commerce sites, as AOL tries to grab a bigger share of the booming global market in Internet advertising.  The deal, at 6.3 billion Swedish kronor, or $900 million, would be AOL's first major acquisition since Randy Falco was named chief executive in November, after the company's shift to a free, advertiser-supported portal from a subscriber-based service.  ''If you want to get a good hold on the European Internet advertising market, TradeDoubler is the best bet,'' said Mats Bergstroem of Nordea Securities in Stockholm.  Internet advertising is growing more than 25 percent a year, according to media buying agencies.  AOL, which is owned by Time Warner, already owns Advertising.com, an agency based in America that buys online media owners' advertising space and selects ads to fill it.  TradeDoubler's main business model is slightly different. It works on behalf of online marketers, gathering ads and offering them to Internet media owners and other Web sites, which can choose which ones to run. An electronics retailer, for instance, could select advertising from a computer maker, and the companies would share revenue from any online transaction that resulted from clicks on the ads.  TradeDoubler operates in 18 European countries but its reach outside Europe is limited. AOL hopes to bolster its Internet advertising presence in Europe after it sold its broadband operations in Britain, France and Germany.  Those agreements came after AOL dropped subscriber fees in the United States and moved to a business model based on advertising.  ''There's a good fit when it comes to geography -- that's obvious,'' the chief executive of TradeDoubler, Martin Henricson, said. ''But there is also a good fit in terms of products and services.''  But analysts said the price AOL and TradeDoubler agreed on -- 215 kronor a share -- might not be enough to satisfy shareholders. AOL said it had the support of investors holding 20 percent of TradeDoubler's shares. It said the offer represented a 20 percent premium to the average share price for TradeDoubler over the last 90 days.  ''Not only does our offer provide an attractive premium valuation, but it also will enable TradeDoubler to play a key role in our strategic focus on growing our online advertising business in Europe,'' said Jeffrey L. Bewkes, president and chief operating officer of Time Warner.  But a Swedish pension fund called Alecta, which has a 10 percent stake in TradeDoubler, said it would vote against the agreement.  ''Our view is that the bid of 215 kronor per share doesn't reflect the value and the growth we see in the future,'' the head of equities at Alecta, Peter van Berlekom, said.  Mr. Bergstroem, the Nordea analyst, said he thought AOL would prevail eventually but probably at a price of more than 230 kronor a share. TradeDoubler stock was already trading at near that price Monday, closing at 227 kronor, up 29 kronor. Mr. Bergstroem said Internet advertising specialists like Adlink Internet Media, which is based in Germany, or ValueClick, which is based in Los Angeles, might be interested in bidding.  The scale of deal-making in online advertising has been growing as the business races ahead. Last month, the Publicis Groupe agreed to buy Digitas, a specialist in Internet marketing, for $1.3 billion.  Online ad techniques that can demonstrate measurable results, including Google ads linked to keyword searches and TradeDoubler ads linked to sales leads, are in particular demand.  ''What it all boils down to is that an advertiser wants performance,'' Mr. Bergstroem said.",

            "fulltext": "Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage house, capped a record earnings season for the major brokers yesterday by announcing a 68 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit.  Merrill's results, like those of its peers, were propelled by a buoyant market for mergers and acquisitions, especially buyouts, and strong results from trading and principal investments.  With the fourth-quarter results in, banks up and down Wall Street are looking more like Goldman Sachs, the competitor that everyone may love to hate but tries to imitate.  At Goldman, where fourth-quarter profit soared 98 percent, more than 64 percent of its profit last year came from trading and principal investments.  Merrill Lynch's results are starting to reflect that trend.  In the fourth quarter, investment banking and principal transactions, including net interest profit, constituted 57 percent of total net revenue, compared with only 45 percent of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005.  ''Trading has become a bigger part of Wall Street's business,'' said Jeffrey Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners.  Over all, Merrill earned $2.35 billion, or $2.41 a share -- sharply higher than forecasts -- compared with $1.37 billion, or $1.41 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The firm also increased its dividend 40 percent, to 35 cents a common share.  Merrill shares fell $1.41, to $95.40 in trading yesterday.  On a conference call with investors, Jeffrey N. Edwards, Merrill's chief financial officer, said the results put Merrill on ''the strongest competitive footing ever as we enter 2007.''  Later, in an interview, he said: ''The most encouraging thing is the continued growth in the pipeline. It's up from the third quarter and is the highest period end pipeline we have ever had.''  For the year, Merrill reported record net earnings of $7.5 billion, up 45 percent from the previous year, on record revenue of $34.7 billion.  For the fourth quarter, trading and investment banking reported revenue of $5.4 billion, up 55 percent from the quarter a year ago and up 21 percent from the third quarter. Fixed-income revenue was up 70 percent, to $2.3 billion, while equity revenue increased 49 percent, to $1.8 billion.  Debt and equity underwriting surged, but strategic advisory services dropped a surprising 18 percent from the previous year to $286 million. Revenue in the Global Private Client business, part of global wealth management, increased 10 percent, to $3.1 billion.  Merrill attracted $22 billion in new client money, up from $17 billion a year ago, bringing total assets managed to $1.5 trillion.",

            "fulltext": "Profit at Verizon Communications fell 38 percent in the fourth quarter, after one-time charges, but the company reported yesterday that it had narrowed the gap with AT&T Wireless in the race for new long-term subscribers.  Verizon's wireless businesses, which is jointly owned by Verizon and the Vodafone Group, added 2.3 million new customers in the quarter, the bulk of them on long-term contracts. It added 1.9 million in the third quarter.  ''We have no intentions of slowing down growth,'' Dennis F. Strigl, Verizon's president, said in a conference call with analysts. ''Our goal is to continue to take share quarter after quarter.''  Verizon's gain of 2.3 million wireless customers inched it closer to AT&T, giving it 59.1 million subscribers at the end of 2006 compared with AT&T's nearly 61 million.  Verizon earned $1.03 billion, or 35 cents a share, down from $1.66 billion, or 59 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The company said the decline was a result of taxes from the sale of its business in the Dominican Republic and costs related to the spinoff of the directory publishing business.  Excluding the one-time charges, Verizon earned 62 cents a share, slightly beating analysts' average forecast of 61 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.  ''They had a very strong quarter,'' said Christopher Larsen, a telecommunications analyst with Credit Suisse. ''They are the owners of new- customer generation.''  Shares of Verizon increased 20 cents yesterday to close at $38.03. The shares have climbed from a 52-week low of $30.10 in May.  For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Verizon's revenue totaled $22.60 billion, an increase of 26 percent over $17.93 billion in the period in 2005, with much of that gain attributed to Verizon's acquisition of MCI's long-distance business.  About $10.10 billion of the revenue came from Verizon's wireless business, up 16.3 percent from $8.69 billion a year earlier.  Mr. Strigl called 2006 a repositioning year. ''We have come out of 2006 a leaner, more efficient company, more focused than where we were a year ago,'' he said yesterday. ''We're very well positioned for a strong 2007.''  Mr. Strigl said Verizon planned to announce today a new pricing option that would add wireless service to its list of services that already includes wired phone, television and Internet, a move he says would give Verizon an advantage over its rivals. However, he added, Verizon has no plans now to match AT&T's new Unity plan that gives AT&T Wireless customers unlimited calling to AT&T's wired-phone customers.  As with AT&T, Verizon's traditional telephone service has been shrinking. The number of phone customers in Verizon's local network declined by nearly 900,000 in the quarter, to 45.1 million. The business services operation that was formed by the acquisition of MCI generated $5.3 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, up 2.7 percent from a year earlier.  Verizon invested $23 billion to expand its high-speed network for Internet and television, in an effort to compete with Comcast and other cable companies moving into the telecommunications business.  During the fourth quarter, Verizon's network, called FiOS, added 165,000 Internet customers and 89,000 television customers. Expanding the service reduced earnings by 10 cents a share in the fourth quarter, and during the first quarter will reduce profit by 11 cents, Verizon said.  Mr. Larsen, the analyst, said that the investment was justified as a critical part of Verizon's three- to five-year growth plan. The executives said the company expected 2007 capital expenditures of $17.5 billion to $17.9 billion. Verizon executives declined to forecast earnings for the year ahead.  Mr. Strigl also confirmed a report yesterday in USA Today that Verizon had been in discussions with Apple Inc., starting two years ago, to sell the Apple iPhone, the combination cellphone, digital music player and organizer that Apple announced this month.  A deal would have given Verizon exclusive rights to sell the iPhone instead of Cingular.  Mr. Strigl said Verizon turned down a possible deal with Apple because it was demanding a share of subscriber revenue and control over servicing the device.  Mr. Strigl said he had no regrets about turning down Apple.  ''We're happy to let someone else experiment with this phone,'' he said. When the time is right, Mr. Strigl said, Verizon will have a ''very competitive offering.''  Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&T Wireless, would not provide details of his company's contract with Apple for iPhone.",

            "fulltext": "The tax system in the United States is supposed to mitigate inequality. But a recent report by Congress's budget agency provides fresh evidence that Bush-era tax cuts have done more to reinforce inequality than to redress it.  The agency found that in 2004, the latest year for which comprehensive data were available, the top 1 percent of households pocketed 14 percent of total after-tax income in the United States, up from 12.2 percent in 2003. That increase, the third largest in one year since the agency started keeping track in 1979, works out to an extra $128 billion. And yet despite that hefty gain, the effective federal tax rate of the top 1 percent decreased slightly.  In contrast, the share of after-tax income going to households in the middle of the income distribution fell to 15 percent in 2004, down from 15.4 percent in 2003 -- the equivalent of a $29 billion loss. In that time, the share of their income going to federal taxes stayed about the same.  One of the reasons the rich are getting so much richer than everyone else is that investment income is highly concentrated among the richest Americans and has grown robustly through much of the Bush years -- unlike wages and salaries. But the rise in investment income hasn't caused rich Americans' income taxes to rise substantially because -- thanks to the tax cuts of 2003 -- investments are now taxed at about the lowest rates in the code.  Another reason for the after-tax advance of upper-income Americans is that an ever larger share of their salaries escapes the payroll tax that pays for Social Security benefits. The annual amount of income subject to the tax -- now $97,500 -- has been adjusted upward each year since 1982, in line with the increase in average wages. But as pay raises at the top of the income scale have increasingly exceeded the average wage gain, incremental adjustments in the wage cap have been inadequate. In 1982, only about 10 percent of all wages escaped the tax. Today, that figure is estimated at 15 percent. The administration has yet to call for raising the cap, though doing so is a matter of simple fairness.  Unfortunately, with the administration having abandoned fiscal prudence for the past six years, it's practically inevitable that inequality will worsen. The bill for the deficit-financed tax cuts of the Bush era will arrive in the years to come. It's likely that the costs will be borne by all, even though most of the benefits have accrued to the few.  Editorial",

            "fulltext": "Families earning more than $1 million a year saw their federal tax rates drop more sharply than any group in the country as a result of President Bush's tax cuts, according to a new Congressional study.  The study, by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, also shows that tax rates for middle-income earners edged up in 2004, the most recent year for which data was available, while rates for people at the very top continued to decline.  Based on an exhaustive analysis of tax records and census data, the study reinforced the sense that while Mr. Bush's tax cuts reduced rates for people at every income level, they offered the biggest benefits by far to people at the very top -- especially the top 1 percent of income earners.  Though tax cuts for the rich were bigger than those for other groups, the wealthiest families paid a bigger share of total taxes. That is because their incomes have climbed far more rapidly, and the gap between rich and poor has widened in the last several years.  The study offers ammunition to supporters and opponents of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which are all but certain to touch off a battle between the president and the Democrats who just took control of Congress.  Democratic leaders have taken pains to avoid an immediate fight over the tax cuts, most of which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. But Democrats are looking for ways to increase revenue well before then, in part because they want to spend more on education and energy without increasing the deficit.  Economists and tax analysts have long known that the biggest dollar value of Mr. Bush's tax cuts goes to people at the very top income levels. One reason is that two of his signature measures, tax cuts on investment income and a steady reduction of estate taxes, overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest households.  But the Congressional study offers additional insight because it incorporates information about what people paid in 2004, the first year in which taxpayers could take full advantage of the cuts on stock dividends and capital gains.  The study estimates that the effective federal income tax rate, which excludes payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, declined modestly for people in the middle- and lower-income categories.  Families in the middle fifth of annual earnings, who had average incomes of $56,200 in 2004, saw their average effective tax rate edge down to 2.9 percent in 2004 from 5 percent in 2000. That translated to an average tax cut of $1,180 per household, but the tax rate actually increased slightly from 2003.  Tax cuts were much deeper, and affected far more money, for families in the highest income categories. Households in the top 1 percent of earnings, which had an average income of $1.25 million, saw their effective individual tax rates drop to 19.6 percent in 2004 from 24.2 percent in 2000. The rate cut was twice as deep as for middle-income families, and it translated to an average tax cut of almost $58,000.  In its report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the overall effective federal tax rate edged up to 20 percent in 2004, from 19.8 percent the year before.  But even with that increase, Americans faced lower tax rates than any time since 1979. If President Bush has his way, those rates could decline even more as the estate tax on inherited wealth is gradually phased out by the start of 2010.  Mr. Bush and his Republican allies in Congress want to permanently extend that tax cut and almost all of the others that Congress passed in his first term. The cost of doing that would be more than $1 trillion over the next decade, a cost that would hit the Treasury at the same time that the spending on old-age benefits for retiring baby boomers begins to soar.  The budget office offered little commentary on its new estimates, but many of its numbers spoke for themselves.  The report shows that a comparatively small number of very wealthy households account for a very big share of total tax payments, and their share increased in the first four years after Mr. Bush's tax cuts.  The top 1 percent of income earners paid about 36.7 percent of federal income taxes and 25.3 percent of all federal taxes in 2004. The top 20 percent of income earners paid 67.1 percent of all federal taxes, up from 66.1 percent in 2000, according to the budget office.  By contrast, families in the bottom 40 percent of income earners, those with incomes below $36,300, typically paid no federal income tax and received money back from the government. That so-called negative income tax stemmed mainly from the earned-income tax credit, a program that benefits low-income parents who are employed.  Put another way: rich families were the undisputed winners from President Bush's tax cuts, but people in the bottom half of the earnings scale were not paying much in taxes anyway.",

            "fulltext": "Spending on health care in the United States increased in 2005 at the slowest pace in six years, mostly because of much slower growth in spending on prescription drugs, the government reported Monday.  It was the third consecutive year of slower growth in the nation's medical bills. Total health spending reached nearly $2 trillion in 2005, growing only a bit faster than the economy as a whole, officials said.  But with new medical technology becoming available every month and with a generation of baby boomers approaching old age, federal officials made no bold claims about having tamed health costs.  ''It is unclear whether this phenomenon is temporary or indicative of a longer-term trend,'' said Aaron C. Catlin, the principal author of the government's annual report on health spending, published in the journal Health Affairs.  Health care accounted for 16 percent of the economy in 2005, measured by gross domestic product, slightly higher than the 15.9 percent share in 2004. Over all, health spending increased 6.9 percent last year, the lowest rate of growth since 1999.  Federal officials said wages had not kept up with the growth of health spending, but, they added, the numbers did not show a huge shift in the burden of health costs from employers to employees. Households spent 6 percent of personal income on health care in 2005, up from 5.4 percent in 2001, officials said.  The most remarkable finding was that spending on prescription drugs grew just 5.8 percent in 2005 -- to $200.7 billion, representing 10 cents of every dollar spent on health care. It was the first time since 1993 that drug spending grew more slowly than total health spending, thanks to efforts by state officials, private insurers and employers.  Medicaid, which provides coverage for more than 50 million low-income people, accounted for much of the deceleration. Medicaid spending on prescription drugs grew an average of 15.4 percent a year from 1994 to 2004, but in 2005 it increased just 2.8 percent, said Mr. Catlin, an economist at the Department of Health and Human Services.  States, which administer the Medicaid program, pooled their buying power, negotiated larger discounts with drug manufacturers, made greater use of low-cost generic drugs and took other steps to rein in drug spending. As a result, Mr. Catlin said, 42 states showed slower growth in Medicaid drug spending in 2005 than in 2004.  Total spending on prescription drugs displayed a similar pattern. The total keeps rising, but the rate of increase has declined every year from its peak of 18.2 percent in 1999. Private insurers have used higher co-payments to discourage the use of certain brand-name drugs. Another reason for the slowdown, federal officials said, was a decrease in the number of new drugs approved.  Home health care was, by far, the fastest-growing category of health spending. Spending on home care rose 11 percent, to $47.5 billion in 2005, the third straight year of double-digit growth.  Health spending averaged $6,697 a person in 2005. But the average is somewhat misleading because health spending remained highly concentrated among a relatively small number of Americans. One percent of the population accounted for nearly one-fourth of all health spending, and 5 percent of Americans accounted for nearly one-half of all spending.  After remaining constant for two decades, this pattern has begun to change slightly. In recent years, officials said, spending became a little less concentrated. More of the health care dollar is being spent on prescription drugs, which are taken by a broad cross-section of the population, rather than on inpatient hospital care, which generates high costs for a smaller segment of the population.  Spending on hospital care grew 7.9 percent in 2005, as in the prior year, while spending for doctors increased 7 percent, slightly less than in 2004.  ''The growing use of prescription drugs largely explains the declining concentration of health care expenditures,'' said Samuel H. Zuvekas, an economist at the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",

            "fulltext": "American companies sold more goods like airplanes, cars and precious metals overseas in November, helping to narrow the trade deficit for a third consecutive month.  Despite the improvement, the United States is still on track to end 2006 with a record trade imbalance, eclipsing the $716.7 billion deficit in 2005.  The Census Bureau reported yesterday that the trade deficit -- the amount by which the value of America's imports of goods and services exceeded the value of its exports -- fell to $58.2 billion in November, the smallest it has been since July 2005. In October, the deficit was $58.8 billion.  Yesterday's figures surprised many economists, most of whom expected the deficit to widen. Through November, the cumulative deficit for 2006 was $701.6 billion, well within reach of the previous record.  But some economists expect the trade outlook to improve this year as a weaker dollar combined with a slower domestic economy and stronger growth overseas help narrow the disparity between imports and exports.  ''The factors that are causing the improvement are really in the case of exports and the strengths of the economies abroad,'' said Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with the Bank of America. ''Japan continues to grow moderately, and emerging Asia is growing at a good clip, led by China. Then Europe also continues to at least outperform expectations. When you put all of that together, that's a boost to U.S. exports.''  In November, exports grew to $124.8 billion, from $123.7 billion in October. The increase was fairly broad-based. Exports of consumer goods like jewelry and sporting goods rose, as did exports of heavy duty goods like parts for commercial aircraft.  At the same time, imports are slowing. American businesses imported $183 billion worth of goods and services in November, up $500 million from October. That brought the three-month moving average for imports down to $184.3 billion, the lowest level since June.  The gap narrowed in November in part because Americans bought fewer goods from China, one of the nation's main trading partners. The net deficit with China fell to $22.9 billion in November, down from $24.4 billion in October. Also, the trade gap shrank because of the third monthly decline in petroleum imports, a factor that economists expect to help improve the trade gap this year if oil prices continue falling.  The Chinese government reported its full-year trade figures yesterday as well, posting a record surplus of $177.5 billion with the world as a whole in 2006. China's exports, and its surplus, continue to grow rapidly; the 2006 surplus was 75 percent greater than 2005's. Imbalanced trade with China has become an issue straining relations with the United States.  Top American officials, including the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, traveled to China last month to press for a shift in the country's trade and currency policies. China accounts for a larger portion of the deficit than any other country.  A reason that Washington says that trade with China remains one-sided is the exchange rate. China keeps its currency, the yuan, loosely pegged to the dollar and the euro at a level that many economists say is undervalued, making its exports affordable and imported goods more expensive.  But economists expect Chinese imports to have less appeal in the United States as a slowing housing market damps consumer appetites.  ''I imagine as U.S. domestic demand growth slows,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist with Capital Economics, ''the wider trade deficit with China will probably continue to grow, but probably at a slower pace.''  Also yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that inventories at American wholesalers accumulated in November at the fastest pace in three months, a sign that imports could slow further.  Surplus Widens in Canada  OTTAWA, Jan. 10 (Bloomberg News) -- Canada's trade surplus widened more than expected in November to the largest since March, as exports of cars and energy products rebounded.  The surplus widened to 4.67 billion Canadian dollars ($3.97 billion), from a revised 3.76 billion Canadian dollars in October, Statistics Canada said. Exports rose 2.8 percent, to 38.1 billion Canadian dollars ($32.4 billion).",

            "fulltext": "China's trade surplus soared to a record $177.47 billion last year as exports continued to rise briskly, China's customs administration announced Wednesday night.  China's widening trade surplus -- it was $102 billion in 2005 -- has been a slowly festering political issue with the United States. Democrats have promised to give it greater attention this year after taking control of Congress in the November elections.  The official New China News Agency said the Ministry of Commerce had previously expected the country's trade surplus to be $168 billion.  Trade data released Wednesday was only a snapshot of total Chinese trade last year, and included few detailed breakdowns by country or product. Chinese officials had previously released figures showing that their country's trade surplus with the United States for the first 11 months of last year was nearly equal to China's entire trade surplus with all other countries, and there has been no sign that this changed in December.  But China's trade surplus narrowed slightly in December, to $21 billion, after hitting $22.9 billion in November and $23.83 billion in October. Ben Simpfendorfer, a currency strategist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said China's trade surplus appeared to be leveling off at a very high plateau.  Compared with economists' expectations, he said, the trade surplus in December ''looks just a touch bigger, but not remarkably so.''  China's surplus in December 2005 had been $11.02 billion, which was China's third-largest monthly surplus ever at the time but has now been exceeded in 9 out of 12 months in 2006.  China's trade surpluses in December sometimes vary widely, however, and many Western experts treat them with caution.  Chinese statisticians have long tended to make a lot of adjustments to December figures in many categories, not just trade, so that full-year figures either reflect more clearly the statisticians' sense of actual economic performance or correspond more closely to government leaders' economic targets.  Among the handful of categories for which China did release full-year figures, the most eye-catching was steel. Chinese steel exports rose 110 percent last year, the government said.  Steel has been at the center of international trade disputes for decades, and some American steel companies and unions are now encouraging the United States government to take action against Chinese steel exports.  Franklin Lavin, the undersecretary of commerce for international trade, said in a speech in Hong Kong on Dec. 8 that China should cut subsidies for its steel industry to reduce the possibility of facing legal action.",

            "fulltext": "President Bush never used the phrase ''energy independence'' in his State of the Union address last week, and it is just as well. His program for cutting gasoline demand is ambitious in scope, but modest in effect, according to experts.  The reason is that the United States has fallen down a very deep well, and it's hard to get out. Last year, the United States imported 60 percent of the oil it consumed. If, as Mr. Bush proposes, we cut gasoline consumption 20 percent by 2017 -- about 2.1 million barrels a day -- then the share of oil imported will fall only by 4 or 5 percentage points.  In fact, the government expects the share of imported oil to fall anyway, to less than 56 percent, because of a rise in domestic production, mostly from the Gulf Coast.  Domestic production has fallen sharply since the mid-1970s, but the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the Energy Department, expects production to rise to almost six million barrels a day by 2017, up from a little over five million barrels a day now.  Mr. Bush is also proposing an increase in fuel-economy standards and an increase in the production of ethanol and other gasoline substitutes, hoping to keep oil consumption relatively steady. Without such intervention, oil consumption is forecast to rise to just over 23 million barrels a day in 2017, from nearly 21 million barrels a day today.  ''It's an enormous challenge,'' said John Felmy, the chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association.  Production of ethanol from corn has already put pressure on food prices, according to some agriculture experts, but Mr. Bush's plan involves tripling the production of corn ethanol, and making huge amounts of ethanol from cellulose, which is not now done commercially.  Integrating that much ethanol into the fuel supply will involve many more rail-tanker cars or trucks, because ethanol cannot be shipped in conventional pipelines. In addition, the gasoline formula with which it is mixed has to be changed, or the mixture evaporates too easily, causing air pollution.  The actual amount of ethanol produced will depend on what is technically feasible and on the price of oil. But at the rate of change suggested by the Bush plan, energy independence is about a century away.  The Basics",

            "fulltext": "In the last 30 years, no major economy in the world has grown at the speed of China's, and no other country has been able to do it year after year, for over a decade.  And on Thursday China did it again, saying that its economy grew by a whopping 10.7 percent in 2006, the fastest pace in more than a decade, with only modest signs of inflation.  ''This is pretty impressive,'' said Shen Minggao, an economist in Beijing for Citigroup. ''I'd say 2006 was about the best year in a decade -- fast growth and low inflation.''  The 10.7 percent growth recorded in 2006 was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit economic growth and China's strongest year since 1995, when the economy grew 10.9 percent.  The economic miracle -- fueled by soaring exports and huge investments in buildings, roads and cities -- goes on even in the face of frequent warnings from government officials and private specialists about asset bubbles, excessive bank lending and an overheating economy.  ''Right now, the economy is growing at the upper limits of what is acceptable,'' said Li Lianfa, an economist at Peking University. ''The government is facing a lot of challenges.''  Chief among them are balancing the supersize growth and heavy investment, and trying to distribute the riches as evenly as possible.  Analysts say the government is determined to keep the economy revving, but is also wants to prevent anything from spoiling the party before 2008, when Beijing is to play host to the Olympic Games.  To help cool the economy, Beijing has raised interest rates and pressured banks to temper lending, with some results. Fixed-asset investment slowed in the latter part of last year, for instance, and economic growth in the last months of 2006 slowed from a feverish second-quarter pace of 11.5 percent.  Many economists are now forecasting that Beijing will take additional steps, possibly raising interest rates again early this year.  Beijing is also under pressure to allow the Chinese currency, the yuan or renminbi, to appreciate more quickly against the dollar, in the hope of easing the country's trade surplus with the United States.  The yuan has strengthened somewhat against the dollar, climbing to about 7.8 yuan to the dollar, from 8.26 yuan in 2005.  Economists have warned that if the yuan does not continue to appreciate against the dollar and other major currencies, China could face protectionist action, which could pose an even more serious threat to economic growth.  These are the trials of a country where everything is red hot -- foreign investment, trade, real estate and stock prices, which climbed more than 130 percent last year and have soared even higher in the opening weeks of this year.  Although inflation, driven largely by higher food prices, jumped to 2.8 percent in December, from 1.9 percent in November, analysts say they are not overly concerned about inflationary pressure. The core inflation number, excluding volatile items like food, was modest, with inflation rising just 1.5 percent in 2006.  But other economists say that accelerated growth often leads to higher prices, and that there could be a lag before stronger signs of inflationary pressure are seen.  Among the government's chief worries has been overinvestment in certain sectors of the economy, like real estate. Stock prices are another concern. After dipping to their lowest level in six years in mid-2005, stock prices in Shanghai have nearly tripled in a record-breaking run.  The central bank said that last October, for the first time in five years, the bank savings of Chinese citizens slid from the month before as more money went into the stock market. An abrupt change in the market, analysts say, could create havoc.  While the stock run-up means that Chinese companies can once again raise money with stock offerings in the domestic market rather than relying on the Hong Kong stock market, huge risks remain. Analysts have long derided the Chinese market as a gambling den crowded with companies using suspect accounting.  In yet another effort to tame the economy, the government raised the banking reserve requirement ratio last month, to help restrict lending. And several economists say they expect interest rate increases in the coming months.  But not all specialists share the view that China's booming economy is in any jeopardy. One such contrarian is Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS, who says his firm's internal figures show that China's economic growth has actually moderated over the last few years. Those figures show that the Chinese economy was growing even faster, at closer to 12 percent, not the 10 percent the government reported.  So the new numbers, he says, are not so alarming.  ''This really shouldn't be an issue for the authorities,'' he said. ''What you're seeing is a very stable economic situation with very little inflation.''",

But experts and politicians agree that the bigger challenge will be the next 150,000 people: the working poor who will get a state-subsidized rate but will still have to pay for insurance, typically $18 to $170 a month depending on their income.  ''This group is going to be much more challenging,'' said Paul Ginsburg, an economist who leads the Center for Studying Health System Change. ''They're dealing with people who don't even think about having health insurance.''  As California maps out its path to near-universal health insurance, Massachusetts could offer some guideposts.  ''We're really changing the culture of providing heath care,'' said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies state spending. ''For some people, it's changing the mind-set from one of showing up at the emergency room or at the local health center with a problem to understanding that they can be insured. Nobody's expecting that would happen overnight.''  Devising a plan that all of the state's political stakeholders could accept took hard work and time. It dates back to at least 2004, when Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican and former venture capitalist, proposed requiring an ''individual mandate'' that everyone get insurance, a feature of the plan now being proposed in California. The president of the State Senate, Robert E. Travaglini, a Democrat, also called for expanded coverage, presenting a more incremental plan than Mr. Romney's.  Then the speaker of the House, Salvatore F. DiMasi, a more liberal Democrat, demanded an expansion of Medicaid and a payroll tax for employers who did not provide insurance. Those provisions were opposed to different degrees by Mr. Romney and Mr. Travaglini, and the legislation almost fell apart.  But several factors helped propel the parties to an agreement: a federal threat to cut $385 million in financing if the number of uninsured was not reduced and the support of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat and rival of Mr. Romney.  The plan requires about 515,000 people, most of the state's uninsured, to get health insurance by July 1 or face penalties that could include the loss of a personal income tax deduction. Medicaid was expanded somewhat to pay for those below the poverty line. The state's $1 billion pool to pay for free care was reconfigured to be used for subsidized premiums for people earning up to three times the federal poverty limit.  The state will set rules to help insurance companies create health plans intended to be affordable enough for people with lower-middle incomes.  So far, about 29,000 people at or below the poverty line have enrolled, or slightly more than half of those eligible for this type of enrollment.  The second phase, focusing on the working poor, began this month and is considered much more difficult.  The insurers selling the subsidized health plans have been trying to get the word out.  Christina Severin, executive director of Network Health, the insurer with most of the lowest-priced plans, said her company was advertising in several languages and enlisting hospitals, clinics and churches to recruit the uninsured.  The other major challenge will involve people not eligible for subsidized plans. First, the agency set up to put the law into effect, Commonwealth Connector, will have to set standards for affordable health care plans, deciding, for example, whether to require plans to include prescription coverage.  ''On the one hand, there's pressure not to set the bar too low so it's not some sort of inadequate plan,'' Mr. Widmer said. ''On the other hand, you need to have options because you're trying to draw in a lot of different groups.  Massachusetts is clearly breaking new ground, going further than other states.  Vermont's program, passed last May, will require private insurance companies to offer coverage for the uninsured starting in October 2007. To pay for the program, employers who do not offer health insurance will pay $365 per employee, and taxes on cigarettes will increase. Unlike Massachusetts, Vermont will not make participation mandatory.  Maine's program, Dirigo, which started two years ago, has run into several obstacles. Fewer than 20,000 people have been enrolled in the program; the goal was to cover all 130,000 of Maine's uninsured by 2009.  Business and insurance groups have sued over a provision that requires private insurers to pay. And a study group recently recommended considering individual mandates, requiring employers to provide coverage and imposing new taxes.  ''Maine has had a fair amount of problems because it was based on a very questionable idea,'' Stuart H. Altman, a professor of health economics at Brandeis University, said, adding, ''It's not going well.''  Correction:  January 12, 2007, Friday  A front-page article on Tuesday about a proposal by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to extend health care coverage to all of California's residents misstated a requirement for insurers. They would have to contribute 85 percent of premiums to health care services, not 85 percent of profits. The article also referred incorrectly to the precedent for universal coverage. California would be the fifth state, not the fourth, to try near universal coverage. (Besides Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont, Hawaii has also tried.)

Koch was mayor, the federal Labor Department reported yesterday.  The cost of housing was the main driver of inflation in the region in 2006, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over all, consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in the region last year, but the cost of shelter rose 6.5 percent, the biggest leap since 1989, said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of labor statistics.  ''The prices of homes in the last couple of years have gone up very, very significantly,'' Mr. Dolfman said, adding that shelter costs in the region are a mixed measure of apartment rents and home ownership.  The previous peak in housing inflation came just before a wrenching recession that dragged the region's housing market into a long slump. So far, the market for real estate has remained strong locally, though it has weakened rapidly in other parts of the country.  Nationally, the cost of housing rose 4.2 percent in 2006, while overall consumer prices increased 2.5 percent.  ''There is kind of a parallel between the mid- to-late 1980s and what we're seeing today in terms of rapid appreciation,'' said Michael Slattery, a senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York.  Prices are still rising locally, but at a significantly slower rate than in the first half of 2006, Mr. Slattery said. That moderation indicates that current prices may be sustainable, he said, adding that there were no signs of a significant downturn like the one that occurred in the early 1990s.  The overall index of housing costs, which takes into account the cost of utilities as well as rents and mortgage costs, rose 5.4 percent last year, which was also the fastest rate of increase since 1989, when it rose 6.5 percent, Mr. Dolfman said.  Housing supplanted energy costs as the financial gremlin for local consumers last year, the bureau's figures show. After soaring in 2005, energy costs rose just 1.7 percent last year, the bureau said.  The price of gasoline rose 5.3 percent, while the cost of natural gas for heating homes fell 6 percent and electricity rose just 1.7 percent.  The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes changes in the prices of food and energy because they are volatile, rose 3.7 percent in the region last year, the biggest annual increase since 1993, the bureau reported.  The only other category of consumer spending that increased 5 percent or more in the region last year was the cost of eating in restaurants. Prices of food outside the home rose 5 percent, while the cost of groceries was flat.  For the country as a whole, the cost of eating out rose more slowly (3.2 percent), but the cost of eating in rose faster (1.4 percent), according to the Labor Department.",

The Interior Department said it would raise the royalty rate to 16.7 percent from 12.5 percent of oil and gas sales, a change that it estimated would increase government revenue by $4.5 billion over 20 years.  ''Increased royalty rates will ensure that during this time of high energy prices the American public receives its fair share of the value of oil and gas,'' said Gary Strasburg, a spokesman for the department.  But the change will not alter any of the thousands of existing offshore leases, nor will it affect a mistake in hundreds of leases that could allow companies to escape as much as $10 billion in royalties over the next five years.  The Interior Department has been trying to renegotiate those leases for the last six months, but has managed to reach voluntary agreements with only 5 of the 56 companies that hold them. Two of the biggest players in the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron and Exxon Mobil, have refused to sign new deals.  Next week, House Democrats hope to pass legislation that would punish companies that refuse to renegotiate, either by imposing a stiff new tax on their production or by prohibiting them from acquiring new leases.  ''Raising the royalty rates will do nothing to help the situation unless this administration expresses a true commitment to actually collecting these payments,'' said Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. ''The oil and gas royalties system is broken and needs to be fixed.''  In a separate decision, the Bush administration announced that it might lift a longstanding prohibition on drilling in Bristol Bay, an area off the coast of Alaska that is part of the North Aleutian Basin. The area has been closed to oil and gas leasing since 1990, partly in response to the enormous tanker spill in 1989 by the Exxon Valdez.  The Interior Department also announced plans to open a big new area in the central part of the Gulf of Mexico, a move that Congress authorized in December.",

            "fulltext": "With New York City's treasury flush with unexpected revenue from an extraordinary surge in the real estate market, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg projected yesterday that the city would have a $3.9 billion surplus to carry over into its $57.1 billion budget next fiscal year, allowing him to cut taxes and set aside money for future expenses.  The city's flush financial state was buoyed by a forecast yesterday showing tax revenues for the current fiscal year coming in $2 billion higher than was predicted just two months ago.  The good news has defied widespread predictions of a downturn in the local economy, and is a startling reversal of Mr. Bloomberg's first two years in office, when, faced with the city's gravest fiscal crisis since the '70s, he raised taxes and cut spending.  Since 2005, tax revenues have been cascading in at surprisingly high levels, a phenomenon reflected in the quarterly financial plan updates the mayor is required to present. In addition to the projected surplus of $3.9 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, the plan forecasts a $1.4 billion surplus next year; both sums will be rolled over into the following years.  In a City Hall news conference, the mayor attributed the exceptionally large surpluses to a boom in property transfer taxes, including mortgage recording taxes, which can generate millions of dollars when large properties change hands. All told, the city expects to collect $2.9 billion in such taxes this year, compared with $902 million in the fiscal year Mr. Bloomberg took office.  The mayor warned that the city had become ''very dependent'' on the transfer taxes, and that the revenues from property sales could drop sharply once the market cools. ''When that starts to slow down, that's not going to be great for us,'' he said.  In the new budget, the sixth of his administration, Mr. Bloomberg has relaxed somewhat the fiscal discipline he demonstrated a year ago, when he insisted on using most of a near-record surplus to set up a health trust fund for retirees, pay off debts, and finance some capital projects without having to borrow.  Mr. Bloomberg said the spending plan reflected a responsible balance between prudence and generosity. He announced last week a one-year, $750 million cut in property taxes, and $250 million in other tax cuts. Yesterday, he announced that he would set aside, out of next year's budget, $1.4 billion to reduce future deficits and $500 million toward a trust fund for the health benefits of city retirees. The mayor has already put $2 billion into the trust fund, which was created last year.  ''The people of New York City have every reason to be happy,'' the mayor said, before quickly adding, ''The ways to be happy long term, however, is to not go out and spend everything you have on one night of food and a few drinks.''  The mayor went through a litany of statistics showing the economy's remarkable recovery from the decline after the 9/11 attack. Mr. Bloomberg took office less than four months after the attack.  The city's population is estimated to be at an all-time high of 8.2 million. Wages have grown every year since 2002. Wall Street bonuses hit a record level, $25.1 billion, last year, lifting income tax receipts and fueling the city's service sector. Tourism is booming, as are hotel occupancy and room rates. Vacancy rates in office buildings are near historic lows, driving commercial rents up.  And yet, the mayor warned that the city, which has so far seemed insulated from the national economic slowdown, cannot escape it. He cited projections showing home sales, which peaked in 2005, continuing to slide until 2009. He predicted that job growth would start to weaken this year, and Wall Street profits next year.  Assuming the one-year property tax cut is extended -- which the mayor warned might not be feasible -- the city would have deficits of $2.6 billion in the 2009 fiscal year and $3.7 billion in the 2010 fiscal year, when the mayor is to complete his term.  Perhaps the greatest long-term threat to the city's fiscal health is the relentless growth in the largely uncontrollable cost of pensions, health care for city employees and retirees, the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and interest on municipal debt. ''The fact remains that we still spend more than we take in,'' the mayor said. ''We have to some day grow our way out of that problem.''  Some fiscal conservatives have urged the mayor to be more aggressive in taking on public-sector unions to rein in the budget. The mayor recently reached contract agreements with the United Federation of Teachers and with the largest union of city workers, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Those contracts are a major reason controllable expenses -- essentially, the cost of employees and contractors -- are rising about 7 percent this fiscal year, to $18.9 billion from $17.7 billion.  The mayor reiterated yesterday his call for Albany to stop making pensions of city workers more generous against the city's wishes. He also expressed support for a fifth pension tier, which would mean less generous retirement benefits for future city workers. The unions would be certain to resist such a move, and it is not clear how much the mayor intends to push the idea.  Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed research organization that advocates fiscal restraint, said she would give the new budget plan a ''moderately strong grade,'' and called Mr. Bloomberg more prudent than many of his predecessors.  ''The continuous surprise is that the city's economy is continuing to pour money into the city's budget,'' she said. ''These are unusual times when the challenge is not to balance the budget but to decide where to put the money.''  Although Ms. Fortuna called for making the property tax cut permanent, she criticized the mayor for not devoting more of the surpluses to paying down long-term debt. ''We're still carrying debt for the $2 billion we borrowed after 9/11 to balance the budget,'' she said. ''Now that we're doing better, couldn't we pay off these debts?''  Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, said the strength of the real estate market and Wall Street profits has endured far longer than anyone expected. ''It's unusual to be in a situation where the city is so flush with cash that it's looking ahead to transfer billions of dollars not just to next year, but the year after as well,'' she said.  She warned that the transfer taxes are at ''a level that, even a year ago, we would have considered unsustainable.''  In another sign that he has become less restrained, the mayor announced this week that he would incorporate into future budgets roughly $62 million in programs that he has traditionally proposed cutting and which are typically later restored by the City Council in the final budget adopted in June. ''We're obviously very gratified,'' the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said yesterday.  As he is required to do every other year, the mayor presented a preliminary 10-year capital plan yesterday. The $77.3 billion plan covers the 2008 to 2017 fiscal years. More than one-third, or $28.4 billion, will be spent on building or renovating schools. The plan also includes $52 million to shore up fragile retaining walls around the city, $44 million for an overhaul of the New York Aquarium at Coney Island and $40 million for electronic voting machines.",

            "fulltext": "ACCORDING to a report released last week by the Harvard School of Public Health, cigarette companies have been steadily increasing the nicotine yield of their cigarettes -- the report describes an average total increase of 11 percent from 1998 to 2005.  Anti-smoking groups have seized on the report as evidence that the Food and Drug Administration must begin regulating tobacco products.  A steady and significant increase in nicotine in cigarettes over the past eight years or so certainly seems worrisome. It sounds as though companies like Philip Morris, which makes Marlboros, are secretly and deceptively increasing the nicotine in their cigarettes and, apparently, lying about it (since they deny the assertions of the report), all in an effort to increase the addictive potential of their cigarettes and harm the public's health.  There are, however, a number of problems here.  First, though I don't dispute the report's assertion that overall nicotine yields in cigarettes have increased, this does not appear to be the case for Marlboro, the leading cigarette brand that commands over 40 percent of the market.  Using the data on nicotine yields of Marlboro cigarettes provided by Philip Morris to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for 1997 through 2006, I conducted my own analysis of the trends in Marlboro nicotine yields.  The average nicotine yield of 16 Marlboro brands consistently reported for the entire time period was 1.81 milligrams in 1997; in 2006, it was also 1.81 milligrams. Thus, the average nicotine yield of these cigarettes in 2006 was exactly the same as in 1997, nine years earlier.  Second, an increase in nicotine yields does not necessarily mean an increase in the harm to smokers. It is well documented that smokers compensate for changes in nicotine levels to get a relatively constant nicotine dose.  This is why ''light'' cigarettes are not safer products. The nicotine levels in each cigarette may be lower, but smokers simply smoke more of them, negating the potential benefits of reduced nicotine levels. Indeed, smoking many ''light'' cigarettes is every bit as dangerous, if not more so, because of the increased exposure to other pollutants in cigarettes, than smoking fewer ''regular'' cigarettes.  Similarly, if nicotine yields increase, smokers might be expected to compensate by smoking slightly less. This could actually have a marginally positive health benefit if it reduces overall cigarette consumption.  Third, tobacco companies are not necessarily doing anything wrong if they are, in fact, increasing nicotine yields. The paradox of ''light'' cigarettes demonstrates that reducing nicotine yields is actually the last thing we would want -- it would, again, result only in people smoking more, and thus increasing tar delivery and the resulting carcinogenic health effects.  The nicotine in cigarettes is indeed a public health problem. But anti-smoking groups have drawn the wrong conclusion from the Harvard report: the problem isn't whether or not nicotine levels are increasing; it's that this deadly, addictive product is available in the first place.  For the past two years, public health groups -- led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids -- have lobbied for passage of legislation that would grant the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco products; shockingly, this bill, which Senator Edward Kennedy is preparing to re-introduce in the next few weeks, would expressly preclude the F.D.A. from simply removing nicotine from cigarettes.  It remains unclear why public health groups would support such a provision, though presumably it's their attempt to appease Philip Morris, whose support is deemed necessary to get the proposed legislation through Congress.  It's not enough to regulate the varying degrees of nicotine in cigarettes. Ultimately, there's only one way to deal with the addictive effects of nicotine, especially on children: grant the F.D.A. the authority to get nicotine out of cigarettes altogether. Anti-smoking groups shouldn't settle for anything less.  Op-Ed Contributor Michael Siegel is a professor of social and behavioral sciences at Boston University.",

            "fulltext": "Renewing concerns about whether there will be enough corn to support the demand for both fuel and food, a new study has found that ethanol plants could use as much as half of America's corn crop next year.  Dozens of new ethanol plants are being built by farmers and investors in a furious gold rush, spurred by a call last year from the Bush administration and politicians from farm states to produce more renewable fuels to curb America's reliance on oil. But the new study by the Earth Policy Institute, an environmental group, found that the number of ethanol plants coming on line has been underreported by more than 25 percent by both the Agriculture Department and the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry's main lobbying group.  The Earth Policy Institute says that 79 ethanol plants are under construction, which would more than double ethanol production capacity to 11 billion gallons by 2008. Yet late last month, the Renewable Fuels Association said there were 62 plants under construction.  The lower tally has led to an underestimate of the grain that would be needed for ethanol, clouding the debate over the priorities of allocating corn for food and fuel, said Lester R. Brown, who has written more than a dozen books on environmental issues and is the president of the Earth Policy Institute. ''This unprecedented diversion of corn to fuel production will affect food prices everywhere,'' Mr. Brown said.  Bob Dinneen, the president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the group had not intentionally tried to play down the number of plants under construction. ''It has been a moving target,'' Mr. Dinneen said in an interview on Thursday. ''We are not trying to hide the ball. We are trying to keep up with a growing and dynamic industry as best we can.''  The Renewable Fuels Association has generally played down concerns in the food versus fuel debate over ethanol, saying that estimates showed there would be plenty of corn to meet the demand for both. ''We can absolutely do that without having a deleterious impact on consumer food prices,'' Mr. Dinneen said.  The National Corn Growers Association said Thursday that farmers were keeping up, noting that growers produced their third-largest crop in 2006 of 10.7 billion bushels. ''All demands for corn -- food, feed, fuel and exports -- are being met,'' Rick Tolman, chief executive of the corn growers, said in a statement. ''Farmers have always responded to price signals from the marketplace and, historically, we have had much more challenge with overproduction than shortage.''  With spot prices of corn soaring to record highs of nearly $4 a bushel last month, farmers are expected to plant some 85 million acres of corn this year, an increase of 8 percent over 2006 and what would be the largest corn-seeding in the country since 1985, said Dan Basse, president of AgResource, an agricultural research company in Chicago.  Ethanol has raised the incomes of farmers and given new hope to flagging rural economies. But the reliance on corn to produce ethanol in the United States has drawn concerns from some economists, who question whether the drive to corn-based fuel will push up the prices of livestock and retail prices of meat, poultry and dairy products.  Mr. Brown is among those who believe the ethanol industry is growing too quickly. He called for a federal moratorium on the licensing of new distilleries. ''We need a time out, a chance to catch our breath and decide how much corn can be used for ethanol without raising food prices,'' he said Thursday.  Like many other experts, he advocates moving past corn-based ethanol into cellulosic ethanol, produced from plant waste and nonfood crops like switch grass.  For now, however, in the anticipation of high potential returns, ethanol plants that rely on corn are being built by everyone from farmers to Bill Gates of Microsoft to a mix of Wall Street investors. In addition to the 116 ethanol plants in production, and the 79 under construction, at least 200 more ethanol plants, with a capacity of 3 billion gallons a year, are in the planning stages.  In all, ethanol distilleries now running or in the works will pull an estimated 139 million tons of corn from the 2008 corn harvest, according to the Earth Policy Institute. That is about double the demand projected by the Agriculture Department and will require over half of the projected 2008 corn harvest of about 11 billion bushels.  Keith Collins, the Agriculture Department's chief economist, did not respond to requests for comment. One reason for the department's projection of just 60 million tons of corn used for ethanol is that it was released last February, before surging oil prices set off investor interest in ethanol plants. The Agriculture Department will release its new projections next month.  But the pace of plant construction may be slowing. Shortages of galvanized steel and backlogs for special tanks for the distilleries have pushed construction time back from 18 months to as much as 28 months for some plants, Mr. Basse said.  Some towns are also demanding environmental studies to better understand the impact ethanol plants can have on water supplies and quality of the groundwater, which has delayed permits for new processing plants.",

            "fulltext": "A new study estimates that employers cheat New York State's workers' compensation system by not paying $500 million to $1 billion a year in required insurance premiums, forcing other employers to pay higher premiums.  The study by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, found that these illegal underpayments represent 15 percent to 20 percent of all the workers' comp premiums that are supposed to be paid each year statewide.  Some companies pay no premiums while others underpay by underreporting the size of their work force to qualify for lower premiums, the study said.  Government, business and labor leaders say the noncompliance hurts the state's business climate by forcing law-abiding companies to pay higher workers' comp premiums when many corporations are already complaining that their premiums are too high.  ''We were surprised to find this magnitude of noncompliance,'' said James Parrott, the chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute. ''This noncompliance has helped cause at least two things: very low benefits for injured workers in New York, which are among the lowest in the country, and second, despite these low benefits, workers' comp premiums that are considered very high.''  Mr. Parrott said inadequate data made it hard to pinpoint the exact amount of cheating.  The report asserts that if more companies paid their full premiums, the extra money would enable the state to cut workers' comp premiums over all and increase benefits for injured workers. The report maintains that a lack of enforcement has emboldened employers to cheat.  ''Not being honest on payroll has become almost an accepted practice in New York State,'' said Art Wilcox, a workers' comp expert with the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''It hurts the competitiveness of a business that does the right thing. It hurts the competitiveness of an insurance broker who refuses to play games with payroll. And it certainly hurts any insurance carrier who won't bend the rules because they're competing against people who will.''  Michael Moran, a spokesman for the American Insurance Association, said he found it difficult to believe the level of noncompliance found by the study. ''It is very important for insurance companies to be paid correctly for all the people they cover,'' he said. ''They work at it very hard. They try to audit to make sure that things are right.''  The Fiscal Policy Institute based its calculations on financial numbers filed with state agencies. It bolsters the finding of a report last year by the state's association of insurance agents, which estimated, based on inside knowledge of industry practices, that up to 20 percent of New York's employers did not pay all their required premiums.  ''New York's honest businesses who are playing by the rules have had to subsidize those who don't even cover their employees or those who seriously underpay for the coverage they do have,'' said David Dickson, president of the association, Professional Insurance Agents of New York State. ''It approaches plain fraud.''  Gov. Eliot Spitzer has pledged to make major changes in the workers' comp system, hoping to hold down premiums and increase benefits. The maximum benefit an injured worker can now obtain is $400 a week.  ''Although we do not know the magnitude of the underreporting of workers' comp obligations, we recognize that it is a serious problem,'' said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for the governor.  Insurance experts say that a company with, say, 100 employees might tell its insurer that it has only 70 workers and then pay premiums for only 70.  But if any of the company's 100 employees are injured on the job, they would be likely to qualify for worker's comp benefits -- either medical coverage and weekly benefits in lieu of wages -- when they are out of work. This means that the amount collected in premiums might fall short of the amount spent on benefits. As a result of such a shortfall statewide, insurers often pressure New York officials to increase premiums for all employers in an effort to balance total premiums paid in with total benefits paid out.  ''The lack of aggressive enforcement forces everybody in the process to bend the rules,'' said Mr. Wilcox of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''If insurance company A enforces the law but all the rest don't, then the client will end up with insurance company B or C or D.''  In finding underpayments, the Fiscal Policy Institute first looked at the total amount of employee payroll -- $389 billion -- that the state's employers reported for 2003 to the Labor Department and Tax Department when they paid their unemployment insurance taxes. Then the institute examined the total payroll reported to the state agencies and the industry association that handle payroll data for employers paying workers' comp insurance. The total payroll reported for workers' comp came to just $311 billion (after the policy institute made some adjustments to account for excluded job categories.)  ''Manufacturers are paying significant amount of workers' comp, and they obviously pay more than they need to because it looks like a large percentage of companies aren't paying into the system,'' said Randall Wolken, president of the Manufacturers Association of Central New York. ''If we're inadvertently increasing some companies' costs, we inadvertently drive some companies out of the state.''  Last July, the state's insurance superintendent, Howard Mills, denied a request by insurers to increase workers' comp premiums, saying, ''The insurers' efforts to fight fraud -- both claimant and employer fraud -- can be said to be anemic at best.''  At the time, Mr. Mills, who stepped down last month, said that without a greater commitment by insurers to fight fraud, it would be hard to justify any overall increase in premiums.  One common practice, insurance experts say, is for companies, often taxi or trucking companies, to say that their drivers are independent contractors (who are not required to be part of the workers' comp system) when by many definitions they are actual employees.  As part of the campaign against fraud, Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and the State Insurance Fund, a state agency that provides workers' comp coverage to 194,000 employers, arrested Anthony Spychalsky last month and charged his company, NY Ceiling & Drywall, with underpaying premiums by at least $207,000. Mr. Spychalsky pleaded guilty on Jan. 8 to insurance fraud.  Many industry experts say the State Insurance Fund, which focuses on providing coverage to small business, is more aggressive in pursuing premium fraud than private insurance carriers.  Robert Lawson, the insurance fund's spokesman, said that in 2006, the fund's 200 auditors did 88,398 field audits. All the audits yielded an additional $89 million in revenues, coming to $493,000 per auditor, Mr. Lawson said.  Mr. Dickson, the head of the insurance agents' group, said, ''The level of audits that are conducted by the commercial carriers and the frequency of the audits, I don't see that at the same standard as the State Insurance Fund's efforts.''  Kenneth Adams, president of the Business Council of New York State, said, ''Whatever can be put in place to limit and reduce fraud by employers or injured workers, that will produce benefits throughout the system.''",

            "fulltext": "One of the stranger and so far unexplained items in President Bush's energy program is his proposal to double the capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to 1.5 billion barrels, over the next 20 years. The proposal carries a $65 billion price tag -- one of several reasons Congress should question Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman closely when he comes looking for the money.  The reserve's purpose is to provide an emergency supply of oil in the event of, say, a terrorist attack somewhere along the global oil supply chain or a natural disaster that sharply limits imports for a short time. The United States is highly vulnerable to such interruptions. It has only 3 percent of global oil reserves but accounts for 25 percent of consumption -- more than 20 million barrels a day, about 60 percent of it imported. The reserve now holds 55 days worth of net oil imports. After the increase, there would be an estimated 97 days of protection.  A larger reserve would seem to make sense in the post-9/11 world, and last year's energy bill did in fact authorize an expansion to one billion barrels. But is there nothing better to do with the money? Might it not be more usefully deployed developing alternative fuels or more efficient vehicles, thus reducing the nation's dependence on oil and its vulnerability to future shocks?  The $2.7 billion the administration proposes to spend on this project each year for the next 20 years is three times the amount that Congress authorized last year for the Energy Department's entire research and development program for alternative energy sources. It may be necessary to increase backup supplies. But the administration would be a lot more persuasive if it displayed a deeper commitment to programs that would provide lasting security by reducing Americans' consumption of oil, rather than just squirreling it away.

To encourage drilling when oil prices were low, Congress waived many royalties for companies drilling in very deep water. But the ''royalty relief'' was supposed to stop if oil cost more than $34 a barrel, when deepwater drilling was assumed to be profitable.  A year ago, the minerals agency admitted what midlevel officials had known for six years: that it had signed leases in 1998 and 1999 allowing oil companies drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to escape $7 billion to $10 billion in royalties over the next five years -- even if energy prices remain at record levels. The giveaway came from a mistake made under President Bill Clinton, but Bush administration senior officials ignored it as oil prices shot to new highs. Last week, Interior's inspector general, Earl E. Devaney, called the agency's response ''shockingly cavalier'' and ''a jaw dropping example of bureaucratic bungling.''  There are investigations by Congress, the inspector general at Interior and the Justice Department into alleged mismanagement, poor oversight of oil companies and possibly even criminal misbehavior.  The agency is also accused of lax oversight of oil company payments. Four of its own auditors have accused superiors of blocking findings that major companies cheated the government. Mr. Devaney criticized the enforcement efforts, saying they rely heavily on unverified reports by oil companies -- ''an honor system,'' he told lawmakers Thursday.

            "fulltext": "The economy seems to be shaking off a slowdown brought on by the precipitous drop in housing, the latest economic data suggested yesterday.  More new home construction was started in December than in November, the Census Bureau reported, and the Consumer Price Index, the nation's best-known inflation gauge, rose at its fastest pace in eight months -- on the surface, at least, an indication of robust demand. Fine print in the reports, however, signaled that the five-year-old recovery is far from being on solid ground.  ''The economy is performing significantly better than many economists had expected as recently as a month ago,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist for the Investment Strategies Group at Bank of America. ''But the housing downturn and cutbacks in auto production are still likely to hamper growth.''  The housing starts came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.6 million units, up 4.5 percent from the November rate. The number of building permits issued last month also rose, suggesting that prices may have fallen enough to draw people back into the market.  Nevertheless, the increase in construction starts was entirely in apartment buildings. Builders started fewer single-family homes in December than in November. And compared with a year ago, permits and construction for any type of housing were down about 25 percent.  ''Very simply, the benchmark single-family sector is very weak,'' Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, wrote to his clients.  The inflation numbers were also ambiguous. The 0.5 percent increase in December came after no increase in November, and sharp drops in September and October.  Not since the 0.6 percent rise in April, has the Consumer Price Index jumped so sharply in one month -- suggesting to Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, that inflation is far from subdued, as the Federal Reserve would like.  ''All this talk about the Fed lowering rates is looking increasingly unlikely,'' Mr. Baumohl said, ''and the possibility is growing that the Fed will have to raise rates in the second half of this year.'' Like many economists, Mr. Baumohl focuses mainly on the so-called core inflation rate, which measures price changes other than those for food and energy.  The core rate rose 0.2 percent in December, matching the increase in four of the last six months. It appears to be leveling off, he said, at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, which was the year-over-year increase reported yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  If so, that would be well above the 1 to 2 percent annual rate that Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, describes as acceptable.  Patrick Jackman, an economist at the bureau, argued that home rents are playing a big role in the core rate's steady increase to 2.6 percent last year from 2.2 percent in 2004 and 2005. The bureau measures housing costs not by the purchase price of a house, but by rents and by what it describes as the rental equivalent of owning a home.  Indeed, more people are seeking to rent homes, driving up rental prices. Compounding the impact on inflation, no other item counts as heavily as rents in the bureau's monthly calculation of changes in the Consumer Price Index.  Most of the 0.2 percent increase in the core inflation rate last month came from rising rents, the bureau reported. Meanwhile, the cost of many other major items -- recreation, for example, education and health care -- rose only mildly or not at all. Car prices fell.  The two exceptions were apparel and tobacco prices, the former going up because of an anomaly in the seasonal adjustment formula the bureau uses for the Christmas season, and the latter because wholesalers raised prices last month.  ''If I were on the Fed, I would say there is really no inflationary pressure in the broad economy,'' Mr. Jackman said.  The 0.5 percent increase in the overall inflation rate last month came mainly from a spike in fuel costs. After falling from August until early November, fuel prices rose until late December -- and then started to fall again.  Absent the spike in gas prices, the overall price index would have risen by about 1.25 percent last month. Oil prices in 2006 rose much more slowly than in 2005. As a result, the rise of 2.5 percent in the overall price index last year was well below the 3.4 percent increase in 2005.  ''Inflation does seem to be subsiding,'' Ms. Reaser said, ''and I think that will continue partly because the Fed's earlier rate increases are still putting a lid on economic growth.''",

            "fulltext": "The main international scientific body assessing causes of climate change is closing in on its strongest statement yet linking emissions from burning fossil fuels to rising global temperatures, according to scientists involved in the process.  In fresh drafts of a summary of its next report, the group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  has said that it is more than 90 percent likely that global warming since 1950 has been driven mainly by the buildup of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and that more warming and rising sea levels are on the way.  Some scientists involved in drafting the report confirmed and clarified details but asked not to be identified because it was not finished.  In its last report, published in 2001, the panel concluded that there was a 66 to 90 percent chance that human activities were driving the most recent warming.  The shift in language in the current draft, while subtle, is substantive. If it remains in the final version, scheduled for release in Paris on Feb. 2, it will largely complete a quest that lasted decades to determine if humans are nudging the earth's thermostat in potentially momentous ways.  Drafts of the report project a most likely warming of 4 to 8 degrees if the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises to twice the 280 parts per million that it averaged for many centuries before the Industrial Revolution.  The carbon dioxide concentration is now roughly 380 parts per million, and many climate experts say it will be extremely difficult to avoid hitting levels of 450 or 550 parts per million, or higher, later this century, given growth in populations and fuel use and the lack of nonpolluting alternatives that can be exploited at a sufficient scale to replace fossil fuels.  Because the panel works under the auspices of the United Nations, dozens of officials from governments around the world have been critiquing drafts, and details inevitably begin to slip into the press in the weeks preceding the formal release.  Snippets of earlier drafts have leaked to some newspapers in recent months and some sections of the latest draft were first published in The Toronto Star yesterday.  Scientists involved in writing the report said the leaks were damaging and potentially misleading, mainly because the final statements are likely to go through further changes.  ''The language is far from final,'' said Kevin E. Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who is a lead author of one section.

            "fulltext": "The Bush administration lowered its estimate of the cost of Medicare's new prescription drug benefit Saturday, saying the price tag had come down about 10 percent in the last six months.  Administration officials said they hoped the numbers would undercut support in Congress for a Democratic proposal requiring the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical makers to secure lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.  The 2003 Medicare law prohibits such direct negotiations, relying instead on private insurers and their agents to seek discounts on prescription drugs. Legislation to repeal that ban is a top priority for the new Democratic majority in Congress.  Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said the new numbers showed that such legislation was unnecessary because competition among private plans had effectively held down costs.  ''Our new estimates provide clear evidence that consumer choice is working,'' Mr. Leavitt said in an interview. ''Government interference will result in fewer choices and less consumer satisfaction.''  Such arguments are unlikely to sway House Democrats, who say older Americans are still paying far too much for medications. But the numbers provide new ammunition for Republicans.  In July, the Bush administration estimated that payments to private plans offering the Medicare drug benefit would total $1.077 trillion from 2007 to 2016. Officials now estimate they will be $964 billion.  The federal government subsidizes premiums and pays a variety of subsidies to insurers to draw them into the Medicare market.  Leslie V. Norwalk, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said drug costs in general had been increasing more slowly than expected. In addition, Ms. Norwalk said, enrollment in the new Medicare program is lower than expected, because some beneficiaries found they had equivalent drug coverage from other sources.",

            "fulltext": "Vowing to reduce the nation's thirst for foreign oil, President Bush called on Tuesday for a huge government-mandated increase in renewable fuels -- mainly ethanol -- and tougher mileage standards for cars and light trucks.  It was the second year in a row that Mr. Bush made ''energy security'' a focal point of his State of the Union address, but his proposals on Tuesday were modest, and perhaps less achievable, than those he made a year ago when he said the nation was ''addicted to oil.''  The centerpiece of Mr. Bush's proposal, which he said would cut the projected use of gasoline by 20 percent over the next decade, was a nearly fivefold mandatory increase in the production of ethanol and other alternative fuels for cars and trucks. The most obvious beneficiaries would be makers of ethanol and other biofuels, but it could also promote the production of liquefied coal.  Mr. Bush called for a mandatory requirement that makers of fuel produce 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels a year by 2017, replacing about 15 percent of the projected gasoline use in that year.  A second major plank of Mr. Bush's energy proposal calls for increasing fuel-efficiency standards of cars and trucks by 4 percent a year -- about one mile per gallon -- starting in 2010 for cars and 2012 for trucks.  That was a significant change from Mr. Bush's approach last year, when he called for ''reform'' of the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, rules, but avoided suggesting specific mileage requirements.  In a third proposal, Mr. Bush called for doubling the amount of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to about 1.5 billion barrels of oil. The doubling would take place at a snail's pace over the next 20 years. Even so, advance word of the idea helped push up oil prices by $2.46 a barrel on Tuesday to $55.04.  ''It's a big change that the president has endorsed these new fuel-efficiency standards,'' said Frederick W. Smith, the chief executive of the FedEx Corporation and a co-chairman of the Energy Security Leadership Council, a group of executive and retired military officers. These standards, he said, match their recommendations, ''which are achievable.''  But the proposals face an array of obstacles, both practical and political. On a practical level, skeptics noted that Mr. Bush's goal for ethanol would require big advances in ''cellulosic ethanol,'' a form of ethanol made from plants like switchgrass that has yet to be produced at anything close to competitive prices. It could also require up to 40 million additional acres devoted to growing the plant material involved as well as a sprawling new infrastructure for transforming the feedstock into fuel.  On a political level, Mr. Bush faces a Congress that is now controlled by Democrats, some of whom criticized him on Tuesday for proposing little to reduce the production of heat-trapping gases implicated in global warming.  ''I am disappointed,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. He said Mr. Bush was ''completely silent'' on energy efficiency and reduction of carbon dioxide from electric power plants, which contribute 40 percent of these emissions.  Cars and trucks account for about one-third of heat-trapping gases that result from burning fossil fuels. Electric utilities and other ''smokestack'' sources were not addressed.  ''If this was a real effort to solve the climate problem, it would include large stationary sources and utilities,'' said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a nonpartisan policy research group.  Ms. Claussen and other environmental leaders also criticized the absence of any proposal for a mandatory cap on emissions of heat-trapping gases.  Many supporters of ethanol and other renewable fuels praised Mr. Bush's proposals. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that the mileage requirement could save 550,000 barrels of oil per day in 2017, and reduce emissions equivalent to ''taking 14 million of today's cars and trucks off the road.''  But many cautioned that the goals would be difficult to attain, might do little to reduce gas emissions and could lead to higher food prices as farmers cater to energy demand rather than food production.  Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, said, ''The big numbers may sound impressive, but this is nothing more than stay-the-course on global warming.'' The proposal, Mr. Clapp said, represents a 1.5 percent cut in carbon emissions a decade hence. ''They will still go up by 14 percent over the next decade.''  And if liquefied coal, which produces double the heat-trapping gases of regular gasoline, is part of the alternative-fuel mix -- as coal-industry lobbyists and environmental groups say is the case -- the emissions reductions would fall significantly.  Mr. Bush called for increasing the requirement for annual production of alternative fuels to 35 billion gallons a year. That would almost quintuple the current mandate of producing 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012. Spurred by tax breaks and soaring oil prices, ethanol production has climbed rapidly and is expected to hit 6 billion gallons this year.  But energy analysts say that corn-based ethanol, which accounts for virtually all of today's production, will not be able to produce more than about half as much alternative fuel as Mr. Bush envisions by 2017.  Mr. Bush also laced his proposals with numerous ''safety valves'' that could delay attainment of his goals.  STATE OF THE UNION",

They confirmed last year's discovery of the nicotine increase by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and went on to identify how the tobacco companies designed their cigarettes to accomplish this.  These manipulations were discovered because Massachusetts requires manufacturers to use a more realistic test to measure how much nicotine is deliverable to typical smokers and requires companies to report design features of their cigarettes. When Harvard researchers reanalyzed the data they found that the nicotine yield per cigarette rose by an average of 11 percent between 1998 and 2005, a conclusion contested by the industry.  Harvard researchers concluded that the companies managed this by using tobacco containing a higher concentration of nicotine and perhaps also by slowing the rate at which cigarettes burned -- thus increasing the number of puffs per cigarette. The companies presumably hoped that additional nicotine would hook more new customers and keep old ones from breaking the habit.  Their continued bad behavior makes it imperative for Congress to grant the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products, including the power to reduce nicotine levels and demand extensive data from the companies.

            "fulltext": "Just a few years ago, politicians and environmental groups in the Netherlands were thrilled by the early and rapid adoption of ''sustainable energy,'' achieved in part by coaxing electrical plants to use biofuel -- in particular, palm oil from Southeast Asia.  Spurred by government subsidies, energy companies became so enthusiastic that they designed generators that ran exclusively on the oil, which in theory would be cleaner than fossil fuels like coal because it is derived from plants.  But last year, when scientists studied practices at palm plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia, this green fairy tale began to look more like an environmental nightmare.  Rising demand for palm oil in Europe brought about the clearing of huge tracts of Southeast Asian rainforest and the overuse of chemical fertilizer there.  Worse still, the scientists said, space for the expanding palm plantations was often created by draining and burning peatland, which sent huge amounts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.  Considering these emissions, Indonesia had quickly become the world's third-leading producer of carbon emissions that scientists believe are responsible for global warming, ranked after the United States and China, according to a study released in December by researchers from Wetlands International and Delft Hydraulics, both in the Netherlands.  ''It was shocking and totally smashed all the good reasons we initially went into palm oil,'' said Alex Kaat, a spokesman for Wetlands, a conservation group.  The production of biofuels, long a cornerstone of the quest for greener energy, may sometimes create more harmful emissions than fossil fuels, scientific studies are finding.  As a result, politicians in many countries are rethinking the billions of dollars in subsidies that have indiscriminately supported the spread of all of these supposedly eco-friendly fuels for vehicles and factories. The 2003 European Union Biofuels Directive, which demands that all member states aim to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010, is now under review.  ''If you make biofuels properly, you will reduce greenhouse emissions,'' said Peder Jensen, of the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen. ''But that depends very much on the types of plants and how they're grown and processed. You can end up with a 90 percent reduction compared to fossil fuels -- or a 20 percent increase.''  He added, ''It's important to take a life-cycle view,'' and not to ''just see what the effects are here in Europe.''  In the Netherlands, the data from Indonesia has provoked soul-searching, and helped prompt the government to suspend palm oil subsidies. The Netherlands, a leader in green energy, is now leading the effort to distinguish which biofuels are truly environmentally sound.  The government, environmental groups and some of the Netherlands' ''green energy'' companies are trying to develop programs to trace the origins of imported palm oil, to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner.  Krista van Velzen, a member of Parliament, said the Netherlands should pay compensation to Indonesia for the damage that palm oil has caused. ''We can't only think: does it pollute the Netherlands?''  In the United States and Brazil most biofuel is ethanol (made from corn in the United States and sugar in Brazil), used to power vehicles made to run on gasoline. In Europe it is mostly local rapeseed and sunflower oil, used to make diesel fuel.  In a small number of instances, plant oil is used in place of diesel fuel, without further refinement. But as many European countries push for more green energy, they are increasingly importing plant oils from the tropics, since there is simply not enough plant matter for fuel production at home.  On the surface, the environmental equation that supports biofuels is simple: Since they are derived from plants, biofuels absorb carbon while they are grown and release it when they are burned. In theory that neutralizes their emissions.  But the industry was promoted long before there was adequate research, said Reanne Creyghton, who runs Friends of the Earth's campaign against palm oil here.  Biofuelswatch, an environment group in Britain, now says that ''biofuels should not automatically be classed as renewable energy.'' It supports a moratorium on subsidies until more research can determine whether various biofuels in different regions are produced in a nonpolluting manner.  Beyond that, the group suggests that all emissions arising from the production of a biofuel be counted as emissions in the country where the fuel is actually used, providing a clearer accounting of environmental costs.  The demand for palm oil in Europe has soared in the last two decades, first for use in food and cosmetics, and more recently for fuel. This versatile and cheap oil is used in about 10 percent of supermarket products, from chocolate to toothpaste, accounting for 21 percent of the global market for edible oils.  Palm oil produces the most energy of all vegetable oils for each unit of volume when burned. In much of Europe it is used as a substitute for diesel fuel, though in the Netherlands, the government has encouraged its use for electricity.  Supported by hundreds of millions of euros in national subsidies, the Netherlands rapidly became the leading importer of palm oil in Europe, taking in 1.7 million tons last year, nearly double the previous year.  The increasing demand has created damage far away. Friends of the Earth estimates that 87 percent of the deforestation in Malaysia from 1985 to 2000 was caused by new palm oil plantations. In Indonesia, the amount of land devoted to palm oil has increased 118 percent in the last eight years.  In December, scientists from Wetlands International released their calculations about the global emissions caused by palm farming on peatland.  Peat is an organic sponge that stores huge amounts of carbon, helping balance global emissions. Peatland is 90 percent water. But when it is drained, the Wetlands International scientists say, the stored carbon gases are released into the atmosphere.  To makes matters worse, once dried, peatland is often burned to clear ground for plantations. The Dutch study estimated that the draining of peatland in Indonesia releases 660 million ton of carbon a year into the atmosphere and that fires contributed 1.5 billion tons annually.  The total is equivalent to 8 percent of all global emissions caused annually by burning fossil fuels, the researchers said. ''These emissions generated by peat drainage in Indonesia were not counted before,'' said Mr. Kaat. ''It was a totally ignored problem.'' For the moment Wetlands is backing the certification system for palm oil imports.  But some environmental groups say palm oil cannot be produced sustainably at reasonable prices. They say palm oil is now cheap because of poor environmental practices and labor abuses.  ''Yes, there have been bad examples in the palm oil industry,'' said Arjen Brinkman, a company official at Biox, a young company that plans to build three palm oil electrical plants in Holland, using oil from palms grown on its own plantations in a manner that it says is responsible.  ''But it is now clear,'' he said, ''that to serve Europe's markets for biofuel and bioenergy, you will have to prove that you produce it sustainably -- that you are producing less, not more CO2.''",

            "fulltext": "Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is proposing to cut property taxes by roughly 5 percent and eliminate the city sales tax on clothing and footwear as New York enjoys the bounty from its booming economy and real estate market, city officials said yesterday.  Mr. Bloomberg plans to outline his proposals today in his annual address to the City Council. The property tax cuts, which would be in addition to an existing $400 annual rebate for homeowners, would apply for at least the next fiscal year, aides said, while the sales tax cuts would be permanent. The entire tax relief package, which also includes measures meant to benefit small businesses, would consume $1 billion of the city's $55 billion budget.  The tax cuts represent a departure for Mr. Bloomberg, who last year used the bulk of a $5 billion surplus for a reserve fund to pay future health care costs and to offset projected deficits. This time, Mr. Bloomberg concluded that given the city's overall fiscal health, revenues that had come in so much higher than expected should be shared with taxpayers and plowed back into the economy, aides said.  The proposals are likely to further burnish the mayor's reputation among New Yorkers, which took a heavy beating during his first term, when he pushed through an 18.5 percent tax increase. Mr. Bloomberg is in his second and final term, and has drawn increasing interest as a potential candidate for national office, and his decision to cut taxes fuels speculation about his future.  The mayor's proposal is likely to get a sympathetic hearing from the City Council, whose members have been calling for tax relief and who set the tax rate as part of the budget process.  City officials, who briefed reporters about the proposals on the condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the cuts in detail.  But, they said, the city was flush enough to set aside $750 million for the property tax cut, at least for the fiscal year beginning in July, which would translate into an average overall reduction of 5 percent. The average yearly tax bill for a condominium owner is $6,449, so a 5 percent cut would translate to $322 annually. The average tax bill on a house is $3,098, and a 5 percent cut would save $160.  The officials cautioned that they could not yet say precisely what a $750 million cut would mean for different types of properties because single-family homes and condominium and co-op apartments are taxed at different rates through a complex formula whose variables have not yet been set for the next year.  Officials did say that they took into account the new tentative assessment roll announced last week, which shows property values on the rise. Mr. Bloomberg plans to commit to only one year on the property tax break because, one aide said, ''he's comfortable that the city can afford the $750 million reduction or cut, but not confident that he can guarantee it on an ongoing basis.''  Although the officials would not say how large the budget windfall is or describe its source in detail, in recent years the city has benefited from taxes on both the enormous volume and size of real estate transactions and from huge profits on Wall Street.  Last week, city officials said that the value of all city properties increased 19 percent last year, a sharp rise at a time when many real estate markets were cooling or declining.  In announcing surpluses in the past, Mr. Bloomberg has often tamped down expectations about the health of the city's finances, and has been accused by some budget experts outside his administration of using revenue estimates that were too low as a tactic to limit spending.  The rest of Mr. Bloomberg's tax cut proposals would require state approval, aides said.  The mayor has already begun seeking an extension of the popular $400-a-year property tax rebate for the owners of one-, two- and three-family homes and co-op and condominium apartments through 2009. That rebate started in 2004, but the annual program will end if the state does not reauthorize it.  Bloomberg administration officials said that reducing the property tax rate was needed to reauthorize those rebates, since when Albany originally granted permission for them, lawmakers required the city to lower its overall tax rate in order to extend the rebate program past 2006.  Under the mayor's sales tax proposal, an existing exemption from the 4 percent city sales tax for clothing and footwear under $110 would be extended to purchases above that amount. The city cannot, however, expand the parallel exemption for clothing items under $110 from state sales tax and a Metropolitan Transportation Authority sales tax surcharge to purchases above that amount. So those items would still be subject to the state and M.T.A. tax, a combined 4.375 percent, rather than the current 8.375 percent city, state and M.T.A. tax.  Such a change would make clothing sellers in the five boroughs more competitive with those in New Jersey, where all clothing is exempt from the sales tax. In Connecticut, clothing under $50 is exempt from the state's 6 percent sales tax.  Finally, Mr. Bloomberg is proposing changes to business taxes that would bring city policy more in line with federal and state provisions, officials said. Those include increasing deductions, creating credits and simplifying filing requirements for unincorporated business and some corporations, with an eye toward helping small-business owners.",

            "fulltext": "A broad coalition of business and consumer groups, doctors, hospitals and drug companies laid out a major proposal on Thursday to provide health coverage to more than half of the nation's 47 million uninsured by expanding federal benefit programs and offering new tax credits to individuals and families.  ''This is a proposal not for mandates but for incentives,'' said Dr. Reed V. Tuckson, senior vice president of UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest insurers. ''It's a careful balance of public and private solutions.''  The proposal, unveiled Thursday after more than two years of work, was endorsed by 16 groups including AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser Permanente, Pfizer and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States.  Other coalition members endorsing the proposal were Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, and America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers.  The proposal comes at a possible turning point in the debate over national health insurance, which has been an elusive goal for Democrats since the New Deal. In the past few years, businesses of all sizes have said that health costs are cutting their profits and hurting their ability to compete. Politicians of both parties predict that the health care issue will figure prominently in the 2008 presidential campaign.  Without waiting for Congress, states like Massachusetts and California are expanding coverage, but want help from Washington.  As a first step, the 16-member group, known as the Health Coverage Coalition for the Uninsured, urged Congress to put more money into the Children's Health Insurance Program and create tax breaks for the purchase of private insurance covering children. Money for the program is running low, and many children are eligible but not enrolled.  Members of the coalition said their proposal would cost $45 billion in the first five years. They did not estimate the cost of insuring millions of adults in later years, nor did they suggest how to pay the costs. Dr. Tuckson said that ''the cost of inaction is higher than the cost of action.''  Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, said, ''Our agreement transcends political and ideological boundaries.''  But tensions bubbled below the surface, showing how difficult it could be to translate the recommendations into law. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Service Employees International Union and the National Association of Manufacturers participated in the coalition for more than a year but did not endorse the final report. The deepest divisions came over how to pay for expanded coverage and who should foot the bill.  Andrew L. Stern, president of the service employees' union, supports health insurance for all but has said that the ''employer-based system of health coverage is over'' and that it ''is collapsing, crushed by out-of-control costs.'' By contrast, members of the coalition said they wanted to preserve and build on that system.  E. Neil Trautwein, former assistant vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the proposal had ''little reference to fiscal realities.''  JoAnn C. Volk, a policy analyst at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said she favored expanding government programs. ''But tax credits would not guarantee access to comprehensive coverage and could leave consumers with high out-of-pocket costs,'' Ms. Volk said.  Suzanne DeFrancis, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: ''We all share the goal of helping people get health insurance. The administration believes this can be done best by helping people buy their own insurance, rather than creating a new government entitlement to health care or raising taxes.''  More than eight million children are uninsured. At least two-thirds are eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. One way to cover these children would be to enroll them automatically in Medicaid or the children's insurance program if they qualified for food stamps or reduced-price school lunches, the coalition said.  In general, Medicaid is available to children under 19 in families with incomes below the poverty level, about $16,600 for a family of three. The coalition said Congress should provide tax credits to families with incomes from 100 percent to 300 percent of the poverty level, to help them buy coverage for children.  The coalition offered longer-term recommendations, saying that states should have the option to expand Medicaid to cover all adults with incomes below the poverty level.  ''Day after day, there is debate and discussion,'' Dr. Tuckson said. ''Day after day, people die. We are sick and tired of the debate. We are focusing on what is achievable.''",

We already are.  Although not reported in major media, on Nov. 30 the Treasury Department awarded nearly $1 billion in tax credits to help offset the cost of nearly $10 billion in private investment to build nine advanced coal projects. The Energy Department also awarded a $235 million grant to match $300 million by a private utility to build a coal gasification facility in Florida.  With another $650 million in tax credits this year leveraging billions more in private dollars, we should produce more than a dozen commercial-scale coal projects holding the promise of lower carbon dioxide.

            "fulltext": "The new health care proposals announced by President Bush this week purport to tackle the two toughest problems confronting the American health care system: the rising number of uninsured Americans and the escalating costs of medical care.  But on both counts, they fall miles short of what is needed to fix a system where -- scandalously -- 47 million Americans go without health insurance.  The financial sinkhole in Iraq and huge tax cuts for wealthy Americans have left the administration with no money to really address the problem. To keep the program ''revenue neutral,'' Mr. Bush would instead use tax subsidies to encourage more people to buy their own health insurance, while imposing additional taxes on people who have what Mr. Bush deems ''gold plated'' insurance.  It is a formula that would do little to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and would have a high risk of producing pernicious results. Even White House officials acknowledged earlier this week that they expected the number of uninsured to drop by only three million to five million people as a result of Mr. Bush's proposals. They expect the states to take on most of the burden.  One enlightened element is that the plan would provide equal tax treatment to those who bought their insurance policies on the individual market and those who got coverage through group policies at work, thus ending a longstanding inequity that favors employer-based policies. To level the playing field, the administration proposes to grant everyone who gets qualifying health insurance a standard deduction -- $15,000 for family coverage or $7,500 for single coverage -- off their income subject to taxation. Those with family policies exceeding $15,000 in value would have to pay taxes on the excess amount.  After the proposed starting date in 2009, the administration estimates, about 80 percent of workers with employer-provided policies would pay lower taxes and 20 percent would pay higher taxes, unless they reduced the value of their health coverage to fit within the standard deduction.  The new standard deduction would almost certainly entice some people to buy health insurance who had previously elected not to. But a tax deduction is of little value to people so poor that they pay little or no income tax. And unfortunately, it is those people who account for the vast majority of the nation's uninsured.  Instead of trying to fix that fundamental flaw, the administration has decided instead to buck it to the states. The White House has offered few details. But its idea is to allow states to redirect federal money that now helps to finance hospitals that provide charity care and use it instead to subsidize health insurance for the poor.  In an ideal world, it would make good sense to insure people in advance rather than wait for them to show up in a high-cost emergency room. But this plan could quickly cripple the safety-net hospitals. Fortunately, no governor would have to accept the offer to redirect funds. The scheme is mostly a reflection of how the administration is unwilling to accept true responsibility for the uninsured.  If the administration really wanted to help low-income people, it would have proposed a refundable tax credit that would have the same dollar value for everyone -- instead of a tax deduction, which primarily helps people in high tax brackets. Even those who do not pay taxes would get a check for the dollar value of the credit, providing them at least some money to help pay for health insurance. Congress ought to recognize that credits are the better approach for even such a limited plan.  As for the tax increases on those ''gold plated'' health policies, the White House is hoping to discourage people from using high-priced comprehensive health policies that cover everything from routine office visits to costly diagnostic procedures that are not always necessary.  The administration's goal is to instead encourage people to take out policies that might reduce the use of medical services, like policies with high deductibles or co-payments, or managed care plans. But even ''copper plated'' policies can exceed $15,000 in cost if they are issued in areas where medical prices are high or to groups with high numbers of older or chronically ill workers.  The whole approach rests on the premise that comprehensive prepaid health policies are a major factor in driving up costs; the theory is that people will tend to use services if they are covered. There is probably some truth in that.  But the main drivers in rising health costs are the costly services, high-priced drugs and hospitalizations for people who are seriously ill with catastrophic diseases or multiple chronic illnesses. Making their health coverage less generous would simply make it harder for them to get the care they need.  The greatest risk in the president's proposal is that it would seem likely to lead many small- and medium-size employers to stop offering health benefits altogether on the theory that their workers could buy affordable insurance on their own. That would leave many more Americans at the mercy of the dysfunctional individual policy market, where administrative costs are high and insurers strive to avoid covering people who are apt to become sick and need costly care.  For all its fanfare, Mr. Bush's plan would be unlikely to reduce the ranks of the uninsured very much. And if things went badly, it could actually increase their numbers. That's not the answer Americans are waiting for and not what they deserve.  Editorial",

            "fulltext": "IN the last six months, media coverage, Congressional hearings, lawsuits by private citizens and a scathing report by the Interior Department's inspector general have exposed a litany of failures in the department's management of oil and gas leases on public lands and waters.  These failures have lost the government billions of dollars in royalties. They have become so glaring, in fact, that there is even speculation that the president, a good friend to the energy industry, might speak about them in his State of the Union address tonight.  If he does, he would only be about a term-and-a-half too late. Our government's record on resource revenue management -- a bipartisan record, one should add -- looks more like that of a corruption-ridden failing state than that of an advanced industrial country. Many of the same failures we criticize elsewhere -- for example, the mismanagement of the Iraqi oil industry -- are rampant here.  Like the Iraqi government, the United States government lacks the systems to determine exactly how much oil and gas is being produced on federal properties. Private lawsuits and state investigations have exposed systematic underpayment by companies on gas leases, yet the Interior Department relies on these companies to tell the government how much they owe, with no independent verification.  The department's inspector general, Earl E. Devaney, found that the government's bookkeeping is so poor that it does not actually know how much money it recovered, nor how many audits it conducted. The inspector general also found the department unable to verify quantities and prices for payments-in-kind (when the government takes a share of the oil and gas instead of cash), which are a growing portion of the royalties the government collects.  Interior's mismanagement is compounded by the secrecy that surrounds the entire enterprise. Though these are payments to the government for oil and gas extracted from public lands, companies are not required to disclose either payments or production levels to the public. The department says such data must be protected, because it could reveal pricing strategies and cost structures.  Such secrecy is contrary to the public's right to know what is being done on public lands. It is also contrary to an emerging international standard of transparency and accountability regarding oil, gas and mining revenues -- standards that the United States is pressing developing countries to adopt.  What's more, energy companies have shown a willingness to comply with these standards. BP almost got kicked out of Angola for trying to disclose its payments there without Angola's permission. Newmont and other mining companies have started posting on their Web sites information about taxes and fees they pay to individual governments. Statoil, a large international operator, is required by Norwegian law to report, country by country, all taxes paid at home and to foreign governments.  ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, Shell, Total, Anglo American and many other international oil and mining companies are part of the international Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative -- under which they report all royalties, taxes, fees, bonuses and payments-in-kind.  In some countries that take part in the initiative, company payments are lumped together before publication. Nigeria, however, requires individual disclosure. Surely the United States should not have a lower standard of disclosure than Nigeria.  Congress, with the president's encouragement, should insist that the United States practice at home the transparency it preaches abroad. It should enact a requirement that all companies extracting oil, gas and other minerals from federal lands publicly report all of their production on those lands and all royalties and other payments made to the federal government from that production.  Only then can the American public have confidence that the taxes owed by those who have benefited from the use of our public lands are being properly accounted for and fully collected.

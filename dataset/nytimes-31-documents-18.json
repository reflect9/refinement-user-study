            "text": "  Patriots Put a Stop to the Titans' Run  Corey Dillon ran for two touchdowns and Tom Brady threw for one as the Patriots defeated the Titans, 40-23, dashing Tennessee's hopes for a playoff spot. The host Titans (8-8) had won six games in a row and needed to beat the Patriots and hope the Jaguars, Bengals and Broncos lost. All three did, but the Titans proved no match for the Patriots (12-4), who will play the Jets in a wild-card game Sunday.  With New Orleans (10-6) set to play host to its first playoff game in the rebuilt Superdome in two weeks, Coach Sean Payton removed several key players early in the Saints' 31-21 loss to the visiting Panthers. Quarterback Drew Brees played only one full series and was 4 of 5 for 46 yards. Reggie Bush rushed for an early touchdown but played little more than a quarter, and running back Deuce McAllister had the day off. Carolina finished 8-8.  Shaun Alexander rushed for 92 yards and scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter as the Seahawks defeated the Buccaneers, 23-7. Visiting Seattle (9-7) had little to play for after clinching the National Football Conference West title; they will play host to Dallas in the first round Saturday. Tampa Bay finished 4-12.  Chargers and Ravens Finish 1-2 in A.F.C.  Philip Rivers threw two touchdown passes after spraining his right foot, and LaDainian Tomlinson also limped off after wrapping up his first rushing title as the Chargers defeated the visiting Cardinals, 27-20. The Chargers (14-2), who have won 10 in a row, clinched home-field advantage throughout the American Football Conference playoffs. Rivers and Tomlinson, who had one of his legs stepped on, said they would have played if the result had been more important, but the Chargers had already earned a first-round bye. Tomlinson ran for 66 yards, giving him 1,815 this season. Arizona finished 5-11.  Using a stellar performance from the defense and an efficient effort from the offense, the Ravens beat the Bills, 19-7, to earn the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C. Chris McAlister returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown and the host Ravens (13-3) allowed only 39 yards rushing. Buffalo finished 7-9.  Colts Finish Strong, but Cowboys Do Not  Peyton Manning threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score as the Colts held on to beat the visiting Dolphins, 27-22. Manning's two scoring passes gave him 275 in his career, moving him ahead of Joe Montana into seventh on the career list. Indianapolis (12-4), which blew a chance to earn a first-round bye by losing four times in the previous six weeks, will play host to Kansas City in a wild-card game Saturday. Cleo Lemon was solid in his first N.F.L. start for Miami (6-10), finishing 18 of 36 for 210 yards.  Done in by repeated mistakes from quarterback Tony Romo and a few more by cornerback Terence Newman, the Cowboys lost To the visiting Lions, 39-31, and blew their chance to stay alive in the N.F.C. East race. ''I can't tell you how disappointed I am, I really can't,'' Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells said. As much as Dallas (9-7) wanted to win the game, Detroit (3-13) might have been better off losing it. By winning, they gave the Raiders the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. But even the Lions could not refuse the gifts the Cowboys gave them, from a penalty on Newman that wiped out an interception return for a touchdown on the game's first snap to Romo's two fumbles and an interception.  In Other Games  Steven Jackson had a career-high 4 touchdowns and 142 yards rushing, helping the visiting Rams defeat the Vikings, 41-21. Jackson's 59-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter prevented Minnesota (6-10) from establishing a postmerger N.F.L. record for fewest yards rushing allowed in a season. They missed by 15 the mark of 970 yards set by the Ravens in 2000. The Rams finished 8-8.  Despite losing running back Ron Dayne (ankle) and tight end Jeb Putzier (broken foot) to injuries in pregame warm-ups, the Texans defeated the visiting Browns, 14-6. Houston (6-10) won back-to-back games for the first time since 2004 and tripled its victory total from last season. Cleveland finished 4-12.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  AMERICAN FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  SEEDING --1  TEAM -- San Diego Chargers (West champions)  The Chargers have won 10 in a row, including the finale over Arizona to clinch home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs. If the seedings hold up, their first game could be a doozy: against New England, whose coach, Bill Belichick, would surely try to confuse quarterback Philip Rivers in his first playoff game, and whose solid run defense would give LaDainian Tomlinson one of his biggest challenges of the season.  RECORD -- 14-2  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 2  TEAM -- Baltimore Ravens (North champions)  Baltimore beat Buffalo yesterday, using its fifth interception return for a touchdown to secure the second seeding and a first-round bye. The Ravens have won four in a row and their offense has been energized since Brian Billick took over the play-calling. But a run in the playoffs will still be all about their top-rated defense. Baltimore held the Chargers to 13 points in October to hand San Diego its first loss.  RECORD --13-3  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 3  TEAM -- Indianapolis Colts (South champions)  The Colts held off the Dolphins yesterday to secure the third seeding, but the Dolphins, playing a meaningless game, moved down the field with ease late in the fourth quarter, a bad omen for Indianapolis. The defense is not as good as it was last year, and the Colts will go only as far as their porous run defense - the worst in the league - allows them. The Chiefs have a star running back in Larry Johnson, and that could mean another early exit for the Colts.  RECORD -- 12-4  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Kansas City  SEEDING -- 4  TEAM -- New England Patriots (East champions)  After an erratic season, the Patriots go into the playoffs on a roll after pounding Vince Young (five sacks, three turnovers) and the Titans yesterday. They remain an intimidating playoff opponent because of Tom Brady, who has had a superb season despite a dearth of receiver talent. But the Jets held the Patriots to 14 points in Foxborough in November.  RECORD -- 12-4  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Jets  SEEDING -- 5  TEAM -- Jets  The Jets defeated the Raiders yesterday to secure a wild-card spot, completing a remarkable rookie regular season for Coach Eric Mangini, who took over a team that won only four games last season. The Jets started looking like a serious threat when they beat the Patriots in Foxborough in mid-November. Now they are going back for another visit, another chance for Bill Belichick to offer Mangini a warm welcome back.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- New England  SEEDING -- 6  TEAM -- Kansas City Chiefs  The Chiefs snuck in when the Broncos lost to the 49ers in overtime yesterday and Pittsburgh beat Cincinnati. The Chiefs survived Trent Green's severe concussion in the season opener because they leaned heavily on running back Larry Johnson. Coach Herman Edwards will no doubt do that again when he faces his friend Tony Dungy's suspect run defense.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Indianapolis  NATIONAL FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  SEEDING -- 1  TEAM -- Chicago Bears (North champions)  The Bears wrapped up the top seeding long ago on the strength of their dominating defense, rendering last night's game against the Packers meaningless. But the Bears still have not answered the biggest question about a potential run to the Super Bowl: What happens if quarterback Rex Grossman struggles? It is a question that could shape the postseason for the N.F.C., especially if the Bears face the Saints, who have a top-five pass defense, in the conference championship game.  RECORD -- 13-3  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 2  TEAM -- New Orleans Saints (South champions)  The Saints, the feel-good story of the season, may also be the most dangerous team in the N.F.C., and after their decimation of the Giants in Week 15, everyone knows it. Drew Brees, Reggie Bush and Deuce McAllister rested for most of the Saints' meaningless loss to the Panthers yesterday. Bush versus Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher in the conference championship would be a blockbuster.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 3  TEAM -- Philadelphia Eagles (East champions)  The Eagles finished the season with five consecutive victories behind the backup quarterback Jeff Garcia, who has been so effective leading a balanced offense that Donovan McNabb's mother is worried about her injured son's future. The Eagles defeated the Giants, 36-22, just two weeks ago, and they seem to be getting stronger and more confident by the week. Their offense, improbably, is in the top five in the league.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Giants  SEEDING -- 4  TEAM -- Seattle Seahawks (West champions)  The Seahawks blew out the Buccaneers in their season finale, but they had lost three in a row before that. They are nowhere near the powerhouse team that went to the Super Bowl last season. And the final game was costly: Cornerback Kelly Herndon broke his left ankle (another cornerback, Marcus Trufant, didn't play because of a sprained ankle) and linebacker Leroy Hill sustained a concussion.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Dallas  SEEDING -- 5  TEAM -- Dallas Cowboys  Less than a month ago, the Cowboys had a two-game lead in the N.F.C. East and looked like the best team in the conference. But yesterday, with a chance to win the division, they lost to the Lions at home, their third loss in their final four games. Quarterback Tony Romo was voted into the Pro Bowl, but he has struggled in those three losses. Seattle's Qwest Field is one of the loudest, most difficult stadiums in the league. Seattle's secondary is injury-riddled, so the complaining Dallas receivers should get plenty of action.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Seattle  SEEDING -- 6  TEAM -- Giants  The Giants survived a near-complete collapse and rediscovered their offense to sneak into the playoffs with almost no momentum. They played the Eagles close for a while two weeks ago, but their defense was gashed up the middle by the Eagles' rushers. Earlier in the season, the Giants forged an epic comeback to beat the Eagles in Philadelphia. But that was a long time ago, and if they beat the Eagles next week, it will be an even greater comeback for the season.  RECORD -- 8-8  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Philadelphia  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

Peyton Manning can counter the Ravens' heralded defense by passing quickly from short drops or handing off to the rookie Joseph Addai. ''We never feel we can go anyplace and not move the ball,'' Colts Coach Tony Dungy said.  But the Ravens' offense has come a long way since Brian Billick fired Jim Fassel as offensive coordinator and took over himself. Steve McNair looks like the McNair of old.  The Colts have lost four straight games on the road, where Manning is 1-4 in playoff games. The Ravens have won four games in a row and 9 of their past 10.  Reporter's Pick: Ravens  Philadelphia (11-6)  at New Orleans (10-6)  8 p.m., Channel 5  The Eagles have the playoff experience and momentum. Most of the Saints have never been to the playoffs, but they have game-breakers on offense, a smart new coach in Sean Payton and a feel-good story.  The Eagles have won six in a row with Jeff Garcia at quarterback, and Brian Westbrook, with his elusive running, is no longer a hidden treasure. The offense must carry the Saints, and the weapons are there in quarterback Drew Brees, Reggie Bush, Deuce McAllister and receivers Joe Horn and Marques Colston.  The Eagles must contend without Lito Sheppard, the Pro Bowl cornerback who has a dislocated elbow. That makes the Saints' offense even more dangerous.  Reporter's Pick: Saints  Seattle (10-7)  at Chicago (13-3)  1 p.m., Channel 5  Both teams have problems at quarterback. When the Bears overwhelmed the Seahawks three months ago, they sacked Matt Hasselbeck five times and had two interceptions. Hasselbeck has 10 interceptions in his past 7 games.  Shaun Alexander's running has carried the load for the Seahawks, but as he said, ''Our offense has some things to do.'' So does the injury-riddled defense, but it may get unintended help from Rex Grossman, who had a passer rating of 0 in the Bears' season finale.  The Bears have been able to afford his bad days because they run well and their defense is good. But that defense is showing signs of weakness, yielding 300 or more yards in each of the past six games.  Reporter's Pick: Bears  New England (13-4)  at San Diego (14-2)  4:30 p.m., Channel 2  This could be the best game of the playoffs. The Chargers have been the league's strongest team and have the best record. The Patriots have won three Super Bowl titles in the past five years.  The Patriots have won seven of their past eight games and are 7-1 on the road. They will need a big game from quarterback Tom Brady to counter Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson, who led the league with 1,815 rushing yards and an N.F.L.-record 31 touchdowns.  ''We're usually looking at the back of his jersey,'' Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said. ''He's killed a lot of people besides us, and he's killed us.''  The Chargers have won 10 in a row and are playing at home, where they are 8-0.  Reporter's Pick: Chargers  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  If the Chicago Bears win the turnover battle Sunday, they believe they will win the Super Bowl.  No team in the N.F.L. forced more turnovers (44) than the Bears during the regular season, and their ball-hawking style has continued during the playoffs. During their 39-14 victory against the New Orleans Saints in the National Football Conference championship game, the Bears produced four turnovers -- three fumble recoveries and an interception.  The Indianapolis Colts have not lost a fumble in three postseason games, but Peyton Manning has thrown six interceptions. If the Bears can force takeaways against Manning and the Colts' offense, Chicago likes its chances.  ''Get the ball out of their hands, any way possible,'' Bears linebacker Lance Briggs said Monday when asked about his team's season-long approach to defense. ''It's preached. If we go in the meeting room to look on film, and we're not running in to get the ball out, we're going to hear about it all day.''  SUPPORT FOR ROONEY RULE -- Bears Coach Lovie Smith remains a supporter of the Rooney rule, which requires N.F.L. teams to interview a minority candidate for every head-coaching opportunity. Smith and Tony Dungy of the Colts are the first African-American coaches to reach the Super Bowl, and 6 of the league's 32 teams have an African-American head coach. The Cowboys are still seeking a coach to replace Bill Parcells, who retired last week.  Last week, the Pittsburgh Steelers hired their first African-American coach, Mike Tomlin. Smith used that example to support the Rooney rule.  ''I would like to think owners would hire the best coach, but I'm here because of the Rooney rule,'' Smith said. He added: ''It's good that guys like Mike Tomlin have gotten an opportunity to be a head football coach. I think Mike would have gotten an opportunity still, but I think it may speed up the process a little bit. Whenever you can get in front of someone is good, and of course the Rooney rule allows you that opportunity.''  IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME -- Bears defensive end Adewale Ogunleye is enjoying the Super Bowl experience because he lives in Miami during the off-season. After the Bears arrived in Miami on Sunday, he went home.  Ogunleye also acted as a tour guide Sunday night, taking some of his teammates out on the town.  ''That was the only night that we're going to be able to do that,'' Ogunleye said. '' I had most of the guys on the team there, most of the single guys. I don't want to get the married guys in trouble.''  SINGLETARY TO INTERVIEW IN DALLAS -- Mike Singletary, a Hall of Fame linebacker, will be interviewed Tuesday for the Cowboys' coaching job. Singletary will meet with Jerry Jones, the team's owner, as the eighth candidate considered to replace Bill Parcells. (AP)  AROUND THE LEAGUE -- Chris Palmer was hired as the quarterbacks coach of the Giants.  The Raiders hired the former Atlanta offensive coordinator Greg Knapp to fill the same job in Oakland. The Cardinals hired Maurice Carthon as the running backs coach and Richie Anderson as the tight ends coach. (AP)  N.F.L. ROUNDUP  ",

            "text": "  After the New England Patriots throttled the Jets on Sunday, 37-16, someone asked Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi if the Patriots took their game to another level during the playoffs.  ''The next level to us is the Super Bowl,'' he said. ''And we haven't been there in a while.''  A while? The Patriots won their most recent Super Bowl title two seasons ago. Only one championship has been decided since then, and it went to the Pittsburgh Steelers.  ''That's a while to me,'' Bruschi said.  So it is these days in New England, where a trip to the Super Bowl is a rite of winter. But this winter will be a bit longer for the Patriots if they are to reach their fourth Super Bowl in six seasons. In their three title runs, they did not have to take the long way. The Patriots had first-round byes and needed only two victories, the first at home, to make it to the Super Bowl.  Last season, when the Patriots had to play a first-round game, they beat the Jaguars. The next week, they lost to the Broncos in Denver, 27-13. Of course, the Steelers won the Super Bowl after winning three playoff games on the road.  The Patriots were 12-4 this season, but that earned them only the fourth seeding in the American Football Conference. And their victory over the Jets set up a meeting with the San Diego Chargers, an opponent that no team wants. The Chargers have a 10-game winning streak and are unbeaten at home. The Patriots, as the lowest-seeded team remaining, cannot be the host for the A.F.C. championship game.  The Patriots were 7-1 on the road, with their only loss a 21-0 shocker at Miami.  But none of their previous road opponents had the offensive firepower that the Chargers possess. The game presents excellent matchups. The up-and-coming quarterback Philip Rivers against Tom Brady, the best playoff quarterback in the game. Brady will also go against one of the best pass rushers in the game, Shawne Merriman. Chargers tight end Antonio Gates matches against whatever combination of defenders have to chase him.  The biggest matchup will be the Patriots' front seven, the best in the league, against Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson, the N.F.L.'s most valuable player. Tomlinson, who was also named offensive player of the year, rushed for 1,815 yards and 28 touchdowns this season.  ''He's explosive,'' cornerback Asante Samuel said of Tomlinson. ''If you sit back, he'll gas you like he does everyone else.''  Chargers Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who has notably failed in previous postseasons, goes up against Bill Belichick, perhaps the best coach of his era. Still, this is the most balanced team Schottenheimer has ever had, and he has said that Tomlinson is the best running back ever to play in the league. Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork called the Chargers ''hands-down the best team in the N.F.L.''  Tomlinson has faced the Patriots only three times since he came into the league in 2001, but he has turned in memorable performances, averaging 141.7 yards. In 2002, he ran for 217 yards and 2 touchdowns. Last season, he had 134 yards and 2 touchdowns as the Chargers scored 24 unanswered points in the second half to win, 41-17. Samuel remembered feeling as if a professional team were playing a college team in that game, with a sense of hopelessness that the Patriots rarely have.  ''He killed us last year,'' Belichick said Monday. ''We're usually looking at the back of his jersey. We haven't done very well against him. He's killed a lot of people besides us, and he's killed us. A team might keep him down for a few carries, but it's just a matter of time before he breaks out, in one way or another, and gets in the end zone.''  The Patriots had the fifth-best run defense in the league this season (they were 12th against the pass and 6th over all), but the perception is that the Patriots lack tremendous speed among their linebackers, a potential liability against Tomlinson. The Jets, who did not have much of a running game, used the speedy Leon Washington to slash through the Patriots' defense. He averaged 4.5 yards while being defended by Bruschi, although he had only 11 carries.  Safety Rodney Harrison, who is critical to holding off a multipronged offensive attack, missed the game against the Jets because of a right knee injury sustained in the regular-season finale against the Titans. On Monday, Belichick said Harrison was day to day and would not say if he would be available Sunday.  In their most successful seasons, the Patriots relied on Harrison in the playoffs to disrupt an explosive offense -- usually that of the Colts and Peyton Manning -- with his hard hits and intensity. Manning and the Colts play the Ravens on Saturday in Baltimore. On Sunday, perhaps without Harrison, New England again faces the most dangerous offensive player, this time in Tomlinson.

            "text": "  There was doubt last week whether Giants tight end Jeremy Shockey would play, but he started in Sunday's 23-20 first-round playoff loss against the Philadelphia Eagles.  Early in the game, it was not clear how effective Shockey would be. He caught an 8-yard pass in the first quarter but he frequently limped after plays because of a left ankle injury he sustained two weeks ago.  In the second quarter, he looked more like the Shockey of old.  With the Giants trailing by 10-7, quarterback Eli Manning completed a short pass to Shockey on first down. Shockey's helmet flew off as he was hit by an Eagles defender, but he remained on his feet and stretched the play into an 11-yard reception that gave the Giants a first down at their 42.  With his helmet still off, he distanced himself from the players near him and then spun the ball on the Lincoln Financial Field grass. Shockey the showboat was officially back.  Two plays after that reception, the Giants faced a third-and-2 at midfield. Manning again looked to Shockey, who kept the drive alive by reaching for a pass and gaining 6 yards and a first down at the Eagles' 44.  On the next play, Tiki Barber rode the momentum that Shockey had generated, running for 41 yards.  Shockey was unable to corral a lob from Manning near the left corner of the end zone three plays later, and the Giants settled for Jay Feely's 20-yard field goal to tie the score, 10-10.  Shockey finished the first half with a team-high three receptions for 25 yards. Unfortunately for the Giants, Shockey did not add to those numbers in the second half. He had a total of three catches in last year's 23-0 playoff loss to the Carolina Panthers.  Shockey played in every game in the regular season except the finale, a 34-28 road victory against the Washington Redskins that sealed a playoff berth for the Giants. Shockey was injured six days earlier going for a pass from Manning in a 30-7 loss at home to the New Orleans Saints. His swollen and sore left ankle kept him out of practice until last Wednesday.  Shockey said last week that he would do everything in his power to play against the Eagles and help erase the memories of last season's loss to the Panthers. But the few first-half plays he made Sunday were not enough to accomplish that.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

No team with a record as bad as the Saints' 3-13 last season had ever made the conference championship the next season. But here are the Saints, and, tailback Deuce McAllister said, ''This may be destiny.''  It may be many things, but two stand out:  Can the Bears' celebrated defense rise from the doldrums and handle McAllister, quarterback Drew Brees, the all-around threat Reggie Bush and those dangerous receivers?  Which Rex Grossman will show up at quarterback for the Bears?  Last week, Grossman was mostly good in an overtime victory against the Seahawks, and the Saints' secondary has been vulnerable to the long pass. Grossman was erratic during the regular season, with 23 touchdown passes and 20 interceptions. ''What's important is those players have a belief in him,'' Saints Coach Sean Payton said.  Although the Bears' defense has lost some of its dominance because of injuries, linebacker Lance Briggs said, ''We tweak a little, we're right back where we were.''  The Bears will have an advantage from a home crowd, and Chicago weather in January can be shocking to a dome team from a warm-weather city.  Reporter's Pick: Saints  New England (14-4) at Indianapolis (14-4)  6:30 p.m., CBS  History favors the Patriots. They have won three of the last five Super Bowls, Coach Bill Belichick is 13-2 in playoff games and quarterback Tom Brady is 12-1. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is 4-10 against the Patriots. In two playoff games this season, he has thrown one touchdown pass and five interceptions.  Or maybe history will favor the Colts in the American Football Conference title game. They beat the Patriots 11 weeks ago, when Brady threw four interceptions, and he threw three last week against the Chargers.  Still, the Patriots have won five straight games, and they always seem to come up with defensive innovations. They will need offensive fire because the Colts, who have suffered on defense all season, have turned into a defensive power.  Reporter's Pick: Patriots  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  Kansas City (9-7) at Indianapolis (12-4)  4:30 p.m., Channel 4  The Colts' offense revolves around quarterback Peyton Manning and receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne, and the Chiefs often struggle to stop the pass. Advantage, Colts.  However, the Colts have allowed 173 yards rushing a game, the most in the league, and the Chiefs have a premier runner in Larry Johnson. He carried 416 times (an N.F.L. record) for 1,789 yards and seemed to thrive on heavy duty. Advantage, Chiefs.  Colts Coach Tony Dungy said he was not concerned with how his team closed the regular season, with losses in four of its final seven games.  ''It's kind of like the Indy 500,'' he said. ''You get that starting position and then you run the race. Everyone remembers who won, not who got the pole.''  Reporter's pick: Colts  Dallas (9-7) at Seattle (9-7)  8 p.m., Channel 4  The coaches -- Bill Parcells of the Cowboys and Mike Holmgren of the Seahawks -- have enjoyed playoff success. So have Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and running back Shaun Alexander, the keys to the Seahawks' offense. Not so Tony Romo, the Cowboys quarterback, and that could be a problem. Dallas's record was 3-3 when the inexperienced Romo replaced Drew Bledsoe. Romo went 5-1 in his first six starts, 1-3 in his last four. He could take advantage of a Seahawks secondary so battered that one starting cornerback is out, the other probably is and three defensive backs were added in recent days. That could also be good news for Terrell Owens, the Cowboys' gifted but talkative receiver.  Reporter's pick: Cowboys  TOMORROW'S MATCHUPS  Jets (10-6) at New England (12-4)  1 p.m., Channel 2  The Jets have won their past three games and beat the Patriots in Week 10, but that was the regular season. For the Patriots, the playoffs are something else. Quarterback Tom Brady's playoff record is 10-1, and he has thrown only 5 interceptions in 11 games. He lacks a go-to receiver, but the Patriots have strong runners in Corey Dillon and Laurence Maroney.  Jets receiver Laveranues Coles said of the Patriots: ''That's the last team you ever want to see in the playoffs because of the way they prepare and the experience they have. I didn't really want to play them in the first round. That's not necessarily a feeling of fear or intimidation. It's more like knowing your opponent a little too well.''  Reporter's pick: Patriots  Giants (8-8) at Philadelphia (10-6)  4:30 p.m., Channel 5  The veteran Jeff Garcia replaced the injured Donovan McNabb (knee) at quarterback and led the Eagles to the National Football Conference East title, Philadelphia's fifth in the past six years. Brian Westbrook, a slick outside runner, also became a force inside as the Eagles won their final five games. ''I believe we are playing our best ball right now,'' safety Brian Dawkins said. The Giants are not; their record is the poorest of the 12 playoff teams. Eli Manning has been inconsistent, Jeremy Shockey is hobbling on a bad ankle, and the defense has its bad days. The one constant has been Tiki Barber, who rushed for a team-record 234 yards last week. He is retiring at 31, so if the Giants lose, this will be his last game.

GIANTS' TIKI BARBER  Tiki Barber (1,662 yards rushing, 465 receiving) and Brian Westbrook (1,217 and 699) finished fifth and sixth in the N.F.L. in yards from scrimmage. They are small and versatile backs, and whoever has the better game will most likely be headed to the next round of the playoffs -- unless they cancel each other out, as they have done twice this season. The Eagles have the 26th-ranked rush defense, but held Barber to 126 yards on 40 carries in two meetings. The Giants, under their new play-caller, Kevin Gilbride, have vowed to be more committed to the run. While Eli Manning has played relatively well against the Eagles, and quarterback Jeff Garcia has sparked the Eagles' five-game winning streak, each team would like to put its chances in the hands of its ball carriers.  BY THE NUMBERS, GIANTS vs. EAGLES  3.15  Average gain per rush by Giants running back Tiki Barber in two games against the Eagles. In 14 other games, Barber averaged 5.4 yards a carry.  8  Sacks of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by the Eagles on Sept. 17. He was not sacked more than twice in any other game, including the Dec. 17 rematch, when he was sacked once.  23  Points scored by the Giants in the fourth quarter and overtime on Sept. 17 to overcome a 24-7 fourth-quarter deficit.  22  Points scored by the Eagles in the fourth quarter on Dec. 17, leading to a 36-22 victory.

            "text": "  By the time Robbie Gould lined up for Sunday's game-winning field goal in overtime, some of his teammates were more nervous than he was.  ''I didn't want to watch it,'' Chicago Bears quarterback Rex Grossman said. ''I didn't see the hold or anything.''  What happened next sent Chicago into celebration. Thanks to Gould's 49-yard field goal, the longest in Bears postseason history, Chicago edged the Seattle Seahawks, 27-24, and will play host to the New Orleans Saints next Sunday for the National Football Conference championship.  Gould's kick, which came 4 minutes 58 seconds into overtime and equaled his career long, did more than just win a playoff game. It lifted a psychological burden from the Bears, who had been beaten at home during their previous two playoff appearances and had not won a playoff game since Jan. 1, 1995. Had the Bears lost this game, it would have cheapened their 13-3 regular season and their N.F.C. North title, sending them into another off-season feeling as if they had underachieved.  Instead, Chicago has a chance to reach the Super Bowl for the first time in 21 seasons. The Bears were far from dominant against the Seahawks, allowing running back Shaun Alexander to rush for 108 yards, and falling behind, 24-21, in the fourth quarter. But when it mattered, Gould delivered. He kicked a 41-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to tie the score, then followed with his game-winner.  The Bears mobbed Gould afterward, knowing that his kick had liberated them from heavy criticism.  ''We didn't play good the whole game, we played good enough to win,'' Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher said. ''It's like a monkey off our back. That was a good big kick -- bad field, 49 yards, windy. That's why he's first-team All-Pro.''  Gould has been a clutch performer for the Bears all season, making his first 24 field-goal attempts, and 32 of 36 over all during the regular season. On Dec. 17, Gould kicked a 25-yard field goal to defeat Tampa Bay in overtime.  Despite the pressure and the importance of Sunday's kick, he tried to treat it as routinely as possible.  ''It wasn't an easy kick, but you want the opportunity,'' said Gould, in his second season with the Bears since going undrafted out of Penn State.  ''This is obviously a big win for our team, keeping our season alive.''  For Chicago, it was a narrow escape. Gould's winning field goal completed the Bears' first possession in overtime, after Seattle won the overtime coin toss but stalled on its drive. Seahawks punter Ryan Plackemeier muffed a punt that traveled only 18 yards, giving the Bears a first down on their 34-yard line. Moments later, Grossman (21 for 38, 282 yards, one touchdown, one interception) completed a key 30-yard pass to Rashied Davis, and the Bears eventually drove to Seattle's 32, setting up Gould's winning kick.  The Bears will play in the conference championship game for the first time since the 1988 season.  Most of the pregame focus was on Grossman's inconsistent play all season, but this game was about all of the Bears. After last season's playoff loss, 29-21 to Carolina, the Bears came back strong, finishing with the best record in the conference. But another one-and-done playoff experience would have been more anguishing.  ''Last night I talked to the team about finishing,'' Bears Coach Lovie Smith said. ''Last year we were in this position, and we weren't able to finish the season the way we wanted. We talked about all we've gone through this year, how it would be a shame not to finish the game on a high note.''  The Seahawks did not go easily. Trailing by 21-14 at halftime, Seattle scored 10 consecutive points to take its first lead. After a 40-yard field goal by Josh Brown cut Seattle's deficit to 21-17, the Seahawks put together a seven-play, 51-yard touchdown drive. On third-and-10 from Chicago's 13-yard line, Alexander found a gaping hole in Chicago's defensive line and rumbled into the end zone, putting the Seahawks ahead, 24-21, with just under five minutes left in the third quarter.  One could almost hear the doubt creeping into Soldier Field when Seattle took the lead, but the Bears showed their resiliency. Grossman's pass was intercepted by Pete Hunter deep in Seattle's territory to end a drive early in the fourth quarter, but the Bears did not panic.  Chicago almost took the lead a few minutes later, but an apparent 66-yard punt return for a touchdown by Devin Hester was nullified because of an illegal block in the back. Once again, the Bears responded, driving 48 yards to Seattle's 23, setting up Gould's 41-yard field goal into the wind that barely sneaked over the crossbar with 4:24 left in regulation, tying the score.  The Seahawks had chances to win in regulation, but they were thwarted on their final two fourth-quarter possessions. Just after the two-minute warning, Seattle had fourth-and-1 from Chicago's 44. Seahawks Coach Mike Holmgren elected to go for the first down, but the play's timing was thrown off after Matt Hasselbeck bobbled the snap. When Alexander finally received the handoff from Hasselbeck, he was thrown for a 2-yard loss by linebacker Lance Briggs.  After stopping the Bears and getting the ball back, the Seahawks threatened again, driving from their 20 to Chicago's 45 with 30 seconds left in regulation. But Chicago defensive tackle Tank Johnson, who was arrested last month on misdemeanor weapons charges, sacked Hasselbeck for a 9-yard loss with 24 seconds to play in regulation.  ''We know what Tank is as a football player,'' Urlacher said. ''It was a big play.''  Time expired in regulation, and after the Bears stopped Seattle and got the ball in overtime, Grossman set up Gould's kick with his 30-yard completion to Davis.  ''The pattern was open all game,'' Davis said. ''Rex was waiting for a big play to come my way. I'm just elated.''  All the Bears were elated, because their season was still alive.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The snap was there, the hold was good and the kick was perfect.  David Akers hit a 38-yard field goal with no time remaining to give the Philadelphia Eagles a 23-20 victory over the New York Giants in a wild-card playoff game on Sunday.  A day after Dallas lost to Seattle when quarterback Tony Romo fumbled the hold on what could have been a go-ahead field goal, the Eagles executed a seemingly routine play that has cost teams important games in recent weeks.  Brian Westbrook had 141 yards rushing, including a spectacular, slashing 49-yard TD run in the second quarter. His 65-yard punt return for an apparent score in the third quarter was nullified by a penalty on rookie Torrance Daniels.  Jeff Garcia threw for 153 yards, one touchdown and played efficiently enough to win for the sixth time in seven starts since replacing an injured Donovan McNabb.  Eli Manning threw two touchdown passes to Plaxico Burress, including an 11-yard strike that tied it at 20 with 5:03 left.  In what probably was his last game, Tiki Barber ran for 137 yards for the Giants. A three-time Pro Bowl running back, Barber plans to retire after 10 seasons in the NFL.  The Eagles are far from finished, though.  Counted out after a knee injury ended Donovan McNabb's season in Week 11, the Eagles (11-6) have won six straight games. They'll play at New Orleans (10-6) next Saturday night.  The Giants overcame a second-and-30 on their tying scoring drive as Manning completed consecutive passes of 18, 14 and 11 yards to Burress.  But the Eagles drove right down the field, mixing in short passes and Westbrook runs. That set up Akers' winning kick.  Led by Garcia and a rejuvenated defense, Philadelphia turned it around after a 24-point loss in Indianapolis, captured its fifth division title in six years and earned the No. 3 seed in the conference.  Meanwhile, the dysfunctional Giants (8-9) fell apart after a 6-2 start. They lost four in a row and six of seven before a win at Washington last week put them in the playoffs.  While the Eagles moved within one victory of their fifth trip to the NFC championship game in six years, the Giants face an uncertain offseason. Coach Tom Coughlin might not be back, Barber is retiring and the embattled Manning probably will hear more criticism after failing to win a playoff game for the second straight year.  ",

            "text": "  Part of the deal that allowed Giants Coach Tom Coughlin to keep his job was the promise to the team's owners that he would make changes. The status quo, following an 8-8 record and a first-round playoff exit, was not good enough.  On Wednesday, the Giants accepted the promise by retaining Coughlin for at least one more season. Yesterday, Coughlin made his first major off-season change: He fired his defensive coordinator, Tim Lewis.  Coughlin will enter his fourth season with the Giants without the two coordinators who started with him in 2004. Coughlin removed the offensive coordinator, John Hufnagel, in the final week of the regular season.  Coughlin declined comment on his decision to remove Lewis, who built powerful defenses with the Pittsburgh Steelers and was the first assistant coach to join Coughlin in 2004. Lewis is a frequent head-coaching candidate and was interviewed this week by the Miami Dolphins, who are looking to replace Nick Saban.  But Lewis, 45, a man with an easy smile and an air of grace, could not create a fearsome defense with the Giants. A below-average unit in 2005, it was overhauled in the off-season, with six new starters for the 2006 opener, but sputtered at midseason, worn thin by injuries.  The Giants allowed 362 points, ranking 24th among the N.F.L.'s 32 teams. The defense ranked 25th in total defense, measured by yards allowed. It was 14th in rushing yards allowed and 28th in passing yards.  In 2005, the Giants were 24th in total defense -- 12th against the run and 27th against the pass.  One logical candidate to replace Lewis is Dom Capers, the former Panthers and Texans coach who spent last season as the defensive coordinator for the Dolphins. Capers, who has interviewed for the Dolphins' head-coaching position, was Coughlin's defensive coordinator with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1999 and 2000.  Coughlin has made no other coaching moves, but the other defensive assistants are in limbo. A new coordinator would probably create his own staff.  The firing of Lewis is a clear signal that the Giants of 2007, while remaining under the control of Coughlin, will be markedly different than the 2006 version.  Coughlin stripped Hufnagel of his responsibilities just five days before the final game of the regular season, handing them to the quarterbacks coach Kevin Gilbride. Hufnagel left the team a few days later.  Coughlin has not given Gilbride the title of offensive coordinator, but he will have at least one offensive assistant to hire, either a coordinator or a quarterbacks coach, as the Giants try to kick-start quarterback Eli Manning's progress.  While Hufnagel was the first to lose his job because of the disappointing season, it appears sweeping changes will be made to the defense, which struggled with injuries and consistency the past two seasons.  The Giants were ranked 10th in total defense after the Nov. 12 game against the Chicago Bears. But a quick rash of injuries near midseason seemed to unravel the unit. In particular, a promising rush defense went soft and a once-rabid pass rush turned benign.  After losing linebacker LaVar Arrington for the season in late October, the Giants lost the seven-time Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan to a foot sprain. Defensive end Osi Umenyiora, who had 14 1/2 sacks and made the Pro Bowl in 2005, missed five games. Cornerback Sam Madison missed several games, returning just as the other starting cornerback, Corey Webster, went down.  The Giants allowed 144 points in the first eight games (an average of 18.0), and 218 in the last eight (27.3). The Giants went 2-6 to finish the season and barely slid into the playoffs.  The Giants ended the season ranked 24th in stopping teams on third down, 25th in first downs allowed, and 26th in sacks per pass play.  In 2005, when the Giants were 11-5 and won the division, the defense faltered late in the season, largely because of a series of injuries to the linebackers.  That drove the Giants to make several defensive changes, while leaving the offense's starting lineup intact. They added three starters through free agency: Arrington, safety Will Demps and Madison. They started their fourth-round draft choice, Barry Cofield, at defensive tackle, and elevated the reserves Webster and Fred Robbins, a defensive tackle, to the starting lineup.  More changes are certain for next season, particularly at linebacker and cornerback. But the biggest change will be the coordinator.  Lewis, a cornerback, played at the University of Pittsburgh. He was chosen by the Green Bay Packers with the 11th overall choice in the 1983 N.F.L. draft, but a neck injury in his fourth season ended his career.  Lewis spent nine seasons as an assistant with the Steelers, the last four -- 2000 to 2003 -- as defensive coordinator before he was dismissed by Coach Bill Cowher. The 2001 defense was ranked first in the league, and his other units finished in the top 10.  Lewis could not replicate that success with the Giants. And when the Giants decided that Coughlin would stay, it was obvious that others would go.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  Even though Peyton Manning was not at his best Saturday, the Indianapolis Colts' defense was superb.  Following a script that few expected, the Colts opened the N.F.L. playoffs by defeating the Kansas City Chiefs, 23-8, at the RCA Dome. It was a role reversal for the Colts, known for their high-powered offense led by Manning, and for their porous defense, which ranked last in the league against the run during the regular season.  ''This was playoff football,'' said Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney, who had three tackles and two sacks. ''If not now, then when?''  The Colts changed their identity against the Chiefs. While Manning threw three interceptions in the game and struggled to find his rhythm in the first half, the Colts held Kansas City without a first down until late in the third quarter.  The first seven times that the Chiefs had the ball, they ran three plays and punted. It looked like a scene from the film ''Groundhog Day;'' the same thing happening over and over, as Kansas City's offense produced only seven first downs and 126 total yards.  ''We couldn't run, we couldn't pass, we couldn't do anything,'' Chiefs Coach Herman Edwards said.  When the Chiefs finally made their initial first down, late in the third quarter on a pass from Trent Green to Tony Gonzalez, Colts fans cheered derisively, mocking Kansas City for its struggles. The Chiefs finished that drive by scoring their only touchdown, but that was not enough to save their season, as the Colts advanced to meet the Baltimore Ravens in the next round of the American Football Conference playoffs.  Manning's numbers looked stout (30 for 38, 268 yards, 1 touchdown), but his two first-half interceptions could have changed the game's momentum if his defense had not bailed him out. Manning's first interception should have led to a Chiefs score, and his second probably cost the Colts at least 3 points.  In the third quarter, a pass by Manning was intercepted by Ty Law with no Colts receiver in the vicinity. Usually, it is Manning who confuses the defense, but for much of the game, Kansas City's defensive players kept showing up in places where Manning did not expect them to be.  ''Obviously, those were three poor throws,'' Manning said of his interceptions. ''I told Ty Law I would be glad to introduce him at the Hall of Fame.''  Unfortunately for the Chiefs, their defense eventually wore down. During the first half, Indianapolis had 15 first downs and held the ball for 21 minutes 5 seconds, compared with 8 minutes 55 seconds for Kansas City. Colts running back Joseph Addai took advantage of the tiring defense, rushing for 122 yards on 25 carries and eventually opening up the passing game for Manning.  Leading by 9-0 midway through the third quarter, the Colts scored the game's first touchdown, driving 89 yards in 12 plays to take a 16-0 lead.  How tired was Kansas City's defense? The Colts finished the drive with seven consecutive running plays, moving from Kansas City's 41. Addai capped the drive by running 6 yards up the middle for the touchdown.  Kansas City went to a hurry-up offense and responded with its only scoring drive, moving 60 yards in 8 plays, capped by a 6-yard scoring pass from Green to Gonzalez. Edwards decided to try a 2-point conversion, which paid off, Green passing to Kris Wilson to cut the Colts' lead to 16-8.  But instead of the momentum swinging to the Chiefs, Manning responded with his best drive of the game, moving the Colts 71 yards for their final touchdown, on a 5-yard pass to Reggie Wayne.  It was a satisfying victory for the Colts' defensive players, who had heard talk all week about how they would struggle to stop Chiefs running back Larry Johnson, who rushed for more yards this season than any player except LaDainian Tomlinson of the Chargers. But Johnson was held to 32 yards on 13 carries by the swarming and aggressive Indianapolis defense. By the fourth quarter, the Chiefs were forced to abandon Johnson and try to catch up through the air.  Nothing the Chiefs tried offensively worked for long, as the Colts overcame a lackluster offensive start.  The Colts squandered a chance to put Kansas City into a deep hole early, dominating the statistics but not the scoreboard. The Colts took a 3-0 lead on their opening drive. On their second drive, they looked poised to take a 10-0 lead, with second-and-goal from the 2. But the Chiefs held firm, and when Coach Tony Dungy sent the field-goal unit onto the field, many fans booed. Adam Vinatieri's 19-yarder, his second of three first-half field goals, made the score 6-0.  A brief momentum swing occurred when Law intercepted Manning early in the second quarter after wide receiver Marvin Harrison broke inside and Manning threw outside. Law, who caught the ball near midfield, almost returned it to the end zone after avoiding a tackle attempt by Manning. But he was caught from behind by Harrison at the 9, setting up the Chiefs with first-and-goal.  A touchdown and the extra point would have given Kansas City the lead, and perhaps have changed the direction of the game. Even a field goal would have helped. Instead, the Chiefs got nothing. After two carries by Johnson made it third-and-goal at the 2, Green fell after being accidentally stepped on by one of his lineman as he backed away from center. Kicker Lawrence Tynes compounded the error by missing a 19-yard field goal attempt, hooking the ball against the left upright. Tynes grabbed his head in disbelief, and the Colts ran off the field in celebration.  It was that kind of day for the Chiefs, and a day of redemption for the Colts' defense.  ''This was the way we had hoped to play all year,'' Dungy said. ''We picked a good time to play that way.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  Stephen Gostkowski said he cleared his mind as he searched for a kicking path between distant uprights, the road that might deliver the New England Patriots to the American Football Conference championship game.  Gostkowski said he did not burden himself with the pressure of the moment, the shoes he was trying to fill or the feat he was aiming to accomplish in his first season in the N.F.L.  ''I don't think about that stuff,'' Gostkowski said after nailing a 31-yard field goal with 1 minute 10 seconds remaining in an A.F.C. second-round playoff game, which lifted New England to a 24-21 victory against the San Diego Chargers on Sunday at Qualcomm Stadium. ''We kick 200 kicks a week. It seemed like any other kick to me.''  One day after Adam Vinatieri, the former Patriots place-kicker, connected on five field goals for the Indianapolis Colts and reminded the Patriots of what they had lost, Gostkowski helped the Patriots move on without him.  Gostkowski also made field goals of 50 and 34 yards, making him 6 for 6 in the postseason and adding a dependable weapon to a Patriots arsenal headlined by quarterback Tom Brady.  Gostkowski's clutch kicks stood out especially because of how the game ended, with San Diego's kicker, Nate Kaeding, failing to make a 54-yard attempt with eight seconds remaining that would have tied the score.  ''I knew I had to hit it on the screws,'' said Kaeding, who missed a field-goal attempt in overtime against the Jets in the playoffs after the 2004 season. ''I just didn't have enough juice on it.''  Gostkowski said of Kaeding: ''He's a good kicker, and he's got a Pro Bowl in him. He's just got to keep his head up.''  The Chargers had a chance to use Kaeding earlier, but San Diego Coach Marty Schottenheimer passed up a 48-yard field-goal attempt on fourth-and-11 in the first quarter. Instead, linebacker Mike Vrabel sacked Philip Rivers, causing a fumble that New England recovered.  ''I thought we had a play that we could use that would make the yardage,'' Schottenheimer said. ''The intention was to be very aggressive, and I thought we had a play that would get it.''  The Patriots turned the error into Gostkowski's 50-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  ''It was the big plays they made,'' Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman said. ''You have to play a team like that for 60 minutes, and you can't make mistakes because they will capitalize on them.''  San Diego safety Marlon McCree said: ''We were the best team in the N.F.L. with home-field advantage. Our loss is very disappointing.''  Among the supposed soft spots on a Patriots roster that has sustained coaching defections and free-agent losses, the position of kicker stood as a potential weakness this season.  Even though Gostkowski finished his college career at Memphis with 369 points -- placing him 13th in Division I-A history -- replacing a veteran with a rookie seemed risky. Vinatieri had been integral to each of New England's three Super Bowl titles.  Gostkowski said he had never felt bogged down by the task of replacing a Patriots legend.  ''I just kick,'' he said. ''I don't know too much about offense, defense or momentum. I just do my job.''  As Brady led the Patriots down the field in the final minutes, Gostkowski said he figured his number would be called soon.  ''I knew we were in good position,'' he said. ''It was a tie game, and we were ready to win. Game-winning kicks are fun. I haven't had too many experiences with them. I'm glad it worked out.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  To reach the Super Bowl, to finally fill in the blanks on the glittering r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that lacked postseason glory, even the Indianapolis Colts conceded it was only appropriate that they would have to vanquish their greatest tormentors.  The New England Patriots had used the Colts as doormats on two of their three Super Bowl runs, stepping over them on the way to constructing a dynasty. But Sunday night, like the kids who had had enough of being beaten up by the class bullies, the Colts fought back. They rallied from an 18-point deficit, then traded scores with the Patriots in a thrilling second half to win the American Football Conference title, 38-34, and advance to Super Bowl XLI on Feb. 4 in Miami.  There, the Colts will play the Chicago Bears, who won the National Football Conference championship game earlier in the day, creating a meeting of great significance: Colts Coach Tony Dungy and Bears Coach Lovie Smith, Dungy's close friend, will become the first black head coaches to lead teams at the Super Bowl.  The victory also sent quarterback Peyton Manning to the Super Bowl for the first time, and he and Dungy can leave behind some of their baggage -- that their successful careers may never be capped by their sport's greatest honor. This was an especially meaningful performance by Manning (27 of 47 for 349 yards and a touchdown), who was criticized for his previous postseason failures as much as he was praised for his statistical dominance.  But he recovered from a shaky start to produce scoring drive after scoring drive in a relentless second half that included a total of eight scores, four of them Colts touchdowns.  The comeback was the biggest in championship game history, and the brilliance of Manning's regular-season play finally transferred to the postseason with a winning drive that may rival the one produced by John Elway against Cleveland 20 years ago. The seven-play, 80-yard drive, which included a pinpoint-perfect 32-yard pass to tight end Bryan Fletcher on the left sideline, ended with the winning touchdown -- a 3-yard run by Joseph Addai with one minute left. It was the first time the Colts led in the game.  Celebration of Dungy's historical milestone, he said, could wait for another day. He wanted the Colts, who had struggled with a leaky run defense all season and had lost three of their last five regular-season games, to enjoy their first trip to the Super Bowl since the Colts moved to Indianapolis in 1984.  ''We had to do it the hard way,'' Dungy said. ''We had to go through a great champion. It's fitting. Our team went the hard way the whole year.''  The Colts endured a remarkable early onslaught by the Patriots, who took a 21-3 lead in the second quarter when Patriots cornerback Asante Samuel returned an interception 39 yards for a touchdown. Manning said later that he had wanted to make up for that play, and he would get his chance much later. But the beginning of the comeback was nearly unnoticed by Colts fans, who were stunned into silence by the yawning deficit.  The Colts kicked a field goal just before the end of the first half, cutting their deficit to 21-6, and that, Dungy said, infused the locker room with energy during halftime. He spoke to his players about being just two scores down, and said that if they could get a good kickoff return and score on their opening drive, they would trail by just one score. Dungy's calm permeates the Colts, and when Manning scored on a 1-yard sneak on the first Colts drive of the third quarter, a blowout was on its way to becoming an instant classic.  ''You don't envision getting down, 21-3, to the New England Patriots,'' Manning said. ''It didn't feel like things were going that bad. It was my fault it was 21-3.''  It was the defense's fault that the Colts had played so poorly at the end of the regular season, losing their bid to have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. But the defense, with the fireplug safety Bob Sanders back from a knee injury, righted itself when the playoffs began, carrying the team to victories against the Chiefs and the Ravens even as Manning struggled. The Colts relied on the defense again to start the comeback.  When they held the Patriots to three downs and out on their first drive of the third quarter, Dungy's halftime speech proved prophetic in the most improbable way. The Colts are laden with offensive talent, but Manning's first touchdown pass of the game did not go to one of his high-profile receivers. It went instead to Dan Klecko, a backup defensive tackle who used to play for New England. Manning rolled to his right and hit Klecko for the 1-yard touchdown pass.  When Marvin Harrison, who was held to four receptions for 41 yards by the Patriots, spun around to catch a 2-point conversion, the score was suddenly -- and very briefly -- tied.  Patriots cornerback Ellis Hobbs had set up that touchdown when he bumped receiver Reggie Wayne in the end zone, giving the Colts first-and-goal on the 1. Redemption came quickly. Hobbs returned the ensuing kickoff 80 yards to put the Patriots at the Colts' 21.  On third-and-goal from the 6, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady saw Jabar Gaffney in the back of the end zone. Gaffney leaped and caught the pass, coming down with his left foot inbounds. Officials ruled that he was pushed out, so the touchdown counted. But a replay on the RCA Dome's video screen indicated that Gaffney might have stepped out of bounds before he leaped for the ball. The touchdown stood and the Patriots led again.  The scoring continued until the Colts finally halted the Patriots at the Colts' 25. The Patriots rookie kicker Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 43-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 34-31 lead with 3:49 remaining.  ''We let too many opportunities get away,'' Brady said. ''We had the ball in good field position at certain times. We should have got the ball in the end zone.''  In years past, a 3-point lead would have been enough for the Patriots to cling to. But they have been unusually erratic this season, and of all things, their defense failed them this time. They looked exhausted, and that was just enough of an opening for Manning, whose record-setting career had lacked a defining moment.  By hitting Fletcher on a play that Fletcher called for himself, the triumphs that had so often belonged to Brady and the Patriots in the past six years were finally snatched away by Manning. When Addai ran in untouched to put Indianapolis ahead, Manning worried that the Colts had left too much time on the clock. He got to the bench and bowed his head, praying, as the Patriots took over with only a minute left.  When cornerback Marlin Jackson intercepted Brady's pass at the Colts' 35 with 16 seconds to play, the Patriots' stranglehold on the Colts was over, and so was Manning's postseason futility. The dynasty was put aside while the monkey was removed from Manning's back.  ''I don't know if you're supposed to pray for things like that,'' Manning said. ''I can remember the disappointment of three years ago, when we lost the A.F.C. championship in Foxborough. I don't get into monkeys or vindication. I don't play that card.''  But Manning had gotten those 7 points back. And he had, at long last, led the Colts to the Super Bowl. Prayers answered.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  Cornerback David Barrett typifies the mind-set Jets Coach Eric Mangini tried to instill during his first year as a head coach. He does not pout about playing time, knowing that his time to contribute will eventually come.  In the first quarter of the Jets' 23-3 victory Sunday against the Raiders, Barrett helped give the Jets the momentum when he caused Raiders receiver Johnnie Morant to fumble after he caught a pass at the Oakland 47. Cornerback Hank Poteat recovered and gave the Jets the ball on the Oakland 44.  Eight plays later, Chad Pennington hit tight end Chris Baker for a 1-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 lead for the Jets.  The Jets did not relinquish the lead.  Barrett had been thrust into the starting lineup after cornerback Andre Dyson injured his right knee last week and was inactive Sunday. Barrett started every game for the Jets in 2004, the last time they made the playoffs. Last season, though, a poke in the eye resulted in a burst blood vessel, and he was limited to starting in eight games. He has been bothered by a hip injury this season, and Sunday was only his third start.  Standing in the middle of the Jets' raucous locker room after the game, Barrett said he simply tried to be prepared ''whenever it is your turn to be ready.''  The Raiders' offense scored the fewest points of any team in the league this season, and the Jets' ability to score early increased the pressure on Oakland quarterback Aaron Brooks and running back Justin Fargas. Brooks was 15 of 26 for 136 yards and Fargas ran for 79 yards on 17 attempts. The Raiders' only score came on a 35-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski in the second quarter.  ''We were set up nicely by Dave's play,'' Baker said of Barrett's forced fumble. ''That turnover was pretty big for us to get up early on them.''  The expectations were not high for the Jets coming into the season, but behind a defense that has allowed 18.4 points a game this season and a balanced offense from Pennington and the rookie running back Leon Washington, the Jets (10-6) are in the playoffs as a wild card and will visit the New England Patriots (12-4) on Sunday.

            "text": "  The Indianapolis Colts, the team of Peyton Manning and the franchise that once had the legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas, probably never thought they would rely on a formula like this to win in the playoffs: Let the defense stop the opponent, have the place-kicker score all the points, and hope the offense does not make too many mistakes.  Who did they think they were -- the Baltimore Ravens? The Ravens, the team that brought football back to Baltimore, patented that game plan when they won the Super Bowl in 2001. But the Colts borrowed a page from that playbook Saturday, beating the Ravens, 15-6, to advance to next Sunday's American Football Conference championship game.  The Colts, for years the N.F.L.'s most dazzling offense, won in the most unexpected fashion -- without scoring a touchdown and by allowing fewer than 10 points for the second time in the playoffs. They have made their way through the playoffs without the white-hot spotlight and the staggering weight of outside expectations bearing down on them. Manning, whose postseason struggles have threatened to blemish his career r\u00e9sum\u00e9, has thrown five interceptions and only one touchdown pass in the past two games.  But if the New England Patriots defeat the San Diego Chargers in Sunday's A.F.C. playoff game, the Colts will play host to the championship game -- a perk they were supposed to enjoy last year, when they were the overwhelming favorite to reach the Super Bowl.  In the waning moments of the victory, after Adam Vinatieri had nailed his fifth field goal, Colts Coach Tony Dungy stood beside defensive tackle Anthony McFarland. Dungy and McFarland had been together in Tampa Bay, too, when the Buccaneers' repeated playoff runs were foiled by a terrible offense. The Bucs fired Dungy for his failure to win a title and he was quickly hired by the Colts, who hoped he would build a defense that would be a complement to Manning's offense.  With two smothering defensive efforts in the playoffs so far, Dungy seems to be fulfilling his mandate at precisely the moment when Manning has stumbled. So, on the sideline, Dungy and McFarland christened the Colts' victory: Call it Buc-ball.  ''We won a lot of games like this,'' Dungy said of his Buccaneers. ''We were having a laugh. These guys are all nervous. Every game we won, we won like this. It's Ravens ball. We outplayed them at their game.''  Actually, the Ravens have never had a quarterback like Manning. But the arrival of quarterback Steve McNair, who once shared league most valuable player honors with Manning, energized the offense and created a balance with the defense that propelled the Ravens to the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C.  But on Saturday both offenses were virtually beside the point. This was just the fourth time in N.F.L. history, and the first since 1979, that neither team scored a touchdown in a playoff game. The Ravens had the best defense in the league this season, but Manning said he could not recall, in his nine seasons in the N.F.L., ever winning a game without scoring at least one touchdown.  Except for the outcome, this was a forgettable performance for him. Scrambling to avoid pressure, Manning frequently overthrew his receivers. He was intercepted twice while completing only 15 of 30 pass attempts, statistically an even worse day than McNair had, with his two interceptions and 18-of-29 passing. Manning's 39.6 quarterback rating was nearly as bad as the 35.5 rating he posted when the Patriots battered the Colts in the 2005 A.F.C. championship game.  ''The plan coming in was to score touchdowns,'' Manning said, laughing. ''We were not planning to score 35 points, but we thought maybe 20 points. I knew it would be tough sledding.''  But Manning completed the most important pass of the game, in the middle of a clock-chewing fourth-quarter drive that kept the ball out of the Ravens' hands when they were trailing by only 6 points. On third-and-5 from Baltimore's 45, Manning zipped a pass to tight end Dallas Clark, who was blanketed by Ravens cornerback Corey Ivy.  At the most critical moment, the Ravens' defense could not make a stop. The Colts' defense, particularly against the run, was shredded for most of the regular season, but with the return of safety Bob Sanders from an injury that forced him to miss almost all of the regular season, the Colts have had consecutive lockdown performances. They held the Chiefs' Larry Johnson to 32 yards rushing last week, then held the Ravens to 83. They thwarted Baltimore's preferred style to get an early lead and then unleashed blitzes.  The Ravens never had the lead because the Colts had the one weapon they lacked last season: a reliable field-goal kicker. The Colts signed Vinatieri away from the Patriots expressly for games like this.  Last season ended for the Colts when Mike Vanderjagt badly missed a field goal in the divisional round. The league's most dynamic offense, and the improving defense, could do nothing to replace those 3 points, so the Colts replaced Vanderjagt as soon as free agency started with Vinatieri, one of the most clutch kickers in N.F.L. history.  Vinatieri has had plenty of highlight-reel moments, none more memorable than his successful field goals in a blizzard against the Oakland Raiders that propelled the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title. But if the Colts go to the Super Bowl, Vinatieri might have provided an omen to their postseason.  His third field goal of the game, late in the second quarter, was a 51-yarder. He did not hit it well and the ball seemed to die as it got near the goal post. It barely hit the cross bar and with its last bit of momentum, it bounced over.  It was not pretty, but it got through. Just like the Colts.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  In trying to create a brighter future for quarterback Eli Manning, Giants Coach Tom Coughlin continues to reach into his own past.  In 1997, Coughlin, then the coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, hired Chris Palmer as his offensive coordinator. Palmer replaced Kevin Gilbride, who had taken the head-coaching position with the San Diego Chargers.  Coughlin has made a similar move now, hiring Palmer as the Giants' quarterbacks coach to replace Gilbride, who was elevated to offensive coordinator. An announcement is expected today.  Palmer, 57, spent last season as the quarterbacks coach for the Dallas Cowboys, who changed to the inexperienced quarterback Tony Romo from the veteran Drew Bledsoe at midseason, with good results.  Palmer was the offensive coordinator of the Jaguars in 1997 and 1998. In 1997, Mark Brunell led the American Football Conference in passer rating and was named to the Pro Bowl.  In 1999, Palmer became the coach of the expansion Cleveland Browns. He was fired after two seasons; quarterback Tim Couch, chosen with the first overall pick in the 1999 draft, struggled to live up to expectations.  From 2002 to 2005, Palmer was the offensive coordinator of the Houston Texans, helping develop another No. 1 overall pick, quarterback David Carr.  The tie between Palmer and Gilbride runs deep. Each played quarterback at Southern Connecticut State -- Palmer graduated in 1972, two years before Gilbride. Both are in the university's Sports Hall of Fame.  Palmer's first coaching experience in the N.F.L. was as the receivers coach for the Houston Oilers from 1990 to 1992. Gilbride was the team's offensive coordinator.  The Giants were 8-8 in 2006 and lost six of their final eight regular-season games. They made the National Football Conference playoffs as a wild-card team, but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round.  Before the final regular-season game, Coughlin stripped the offensive coordinator John Hufnagel of his responsibilities and handed them to Gilbride.  Manning, the first choice in the 2004 draft, was inconsistent most of the season and showed few signs of progress from the previous season.  ''I've only had one quarterbacks coach in the N.F.L.,'' Manning said during a conference call Thursday when asked about his ideal coach. ''I'm just looking for someone who's obviously smart, intelligent. Someone who we can have a good relationship and just really communicate well together and be on the same page with things. Someone who has good drills and is going to be hard on me and coach me and make sure that everything that I'm doing, I'm doing to get better.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  The Giants, whose championship hopes this season collapsed when their defense collapsed, turned to their bitter rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles, for a new defensive coordinator.  Steve Spagnuolo, the Eagles' linebackers coach and a defensive assistant for the team for eight years, was hired yesterday to replace the fired Tim Lewis. In Philadelphia, Spagnuolo coached defensive backs Brian Dawkins, Bobby Taylor and Troy Vincent for three years and linebacker Jeremiah Trotter for the past three. All have been Pro Bowl players.  Expecting to rely on their defense in 2006, the Giants suffered from serious injuries to defensive ends Michael Strahan and Osi Umenyiora and linebacker LaVar Arrington, and often-erratic play by others. In the second half of the season, they lost four games in which they led or were tied in the fourth quarter.  Four days after their playoff loss to the Eagles, the Giants fired Lewis, their defensive coordinator for the past three seasons. In a teleconference yesterday, Coach Tom Coughlin said he had researched many potential successors but had interviewed only Spagnuolo.  Coughlin spoke from Mobile, Ala., where he is monitoring daily practice sessions for the Senior Bowl. He said he was impressed by Spagnuolo's achievements with the Eagles.  ''I was looking for a guy who had an opportunity to work with outstanding people in the league,'' Coughlin said, ''not just an aggressive system, because the system here has been aggressive. It is a plus that he knows our division, and is also a plus that he comes from a program that has Andy Reid as a head coach and Jim Johnson as a defensive coordinator.''  Spagnuolo, 47, played wide receiver at Springfield (Mass.) College. He graduated in 1981 and started his coaching career a year later.  He joined the Eagles in 1999 as a defensive assistant/quality control coach. Before that, he was the defensive coordinator at Massachusetts and at Maine and an intern, scout, personnel aide and assistant coach for more than a half-dozen college and professional teams.  This season, the Giants' defense allowed 342.4 yards a game, eighth most in the N.F.L. The Eagles allowed 328.1, but their reliance on blitzing helped them to a 10-6 record. In the playoffs, they defeated the Giants on a last-play field goal, then lost to the New Orleans Saints.  The Giants finished with an 8-8 record and a need for defensive changes. Coughlin, however, said all of the assistant coaches on defense would remain. He said Spagnuolo's defense would be based on personnel rather than philosophies, and that seemed fine with Spagnuolo.  In the same conference call, Spagnuolo said: ''You've seen the Giants against the Eagles the last two years, and that's the bulk of what I want to do. It may be a slight advantage facing the Eagles, but I don't know if that is going to make a difference between winning and losing. I may know what they're going to do, but I don't know what they're going to do on that play.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  The Mets most likely completed their bench for next season by signing the utility player David Newhan yesterday to a one-year contract. Newhan, 33, adds another left-handed bat and provides additional versatility. A natural infielder, Newhan has played 169 of his 229 career games in the outfield and has started at every infield position except shortstop. With Endy Ch\u00e1vez and Ben Johnson projected as the team's fourth and fifth outfielders, Newhan should receive most of his playing time in the infield or as a pinch-hitter.  ''David is a versatile player who can help us in so many spots on the field,'' Mets General Manager Omar Minaya said in a statement. ''We couldn't be more pleased to have him in our organization.''  Newhan batted .252 in 39 games with Baltimore last season and missed four months with a broken fibula. In seven major league seasons with San Diego, Philadelphia and Baltimore, Newhan has hit .256 with 20 home runs and 102 runs batted in. His best season came with Baltimore in 2004, when he hit .311 with 8 homers and 54 R.B.I.  Newhan is the son of Ross Newhan, a former baseball writer for The Los Angeles Times who won the J. G. Taylor Spink Award in 2000 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.  BEN SHPIGEL  BASEBALL  ",

            "text": "  The emergence of running back Joseph Addai has helped the Indianapolis Colts overcome the loss of Edgerrin James.  When James signed as a free agent with the Arizona Cardinals last March, the Colts faced a problem. James rushed for at least 1,200 yards in five of his seven seasons with the Colts, and they needed someone to replace not only his running but his pass blocking for quarterback Peyton Manning.  That was a lot to ask of a rookie, but Addai provided the answer. Quietly and efficiently, Addai, drafted No. 30 over all by the Colts last April out of Louisiana State, rushed for 1,081 yards this season, more than the three running backs drafted ahead of him: Reggie Bush, drafted No. 2 by the New Orleans Saints; Laurence Maroney (No. 21) of the New England Patriots; and DeAngelo Williams (No. 27) of the Carolina Panthers.  During the Colts' 23-8 playoff victory against the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday, Addai showed he could respond to postseason pressure, rushing for 122 yards on 25 carries and scoring the Colts' first touchdown, on a 6-yard run.  Some would call Addai a surprise. His coach, Tony Dungy, and the Colts' president, Bill Polian, do not.  ''We knew it was going to be a good draft for running backs,'' Dungy said during his news conference Sunday. ''We felt pretty confident that we would be able to get a good back in the first round. We liked Maroney, we liked Maurice Drew, we liked DeAngelo Williams, we liked Joseph. We felt like we were going to get one of those backs, and they all would bring something to the table. But honestly, when you look at everything that we do, Joseph was most like Edgerrin of all of those guys.  ''We had a long debate the night before the draft: If everybody was there, who would we take? Bill was really a Joseph Addai guy. We felt good that our running back situation was going to be in good hands.''  The Colts made a shrewd draft-day decision, considering that Addai never rushed for more than 1,000 yards during any college season. His best season came as a senior, when he ran for 911 yards. Sharing carries with other running backs kept him from amassing more impressive numbers.  Since arriving in Indianapolis, Addai has had little trouble impressing teammates. Addai picked up the Colts' complicated offensive system quickly, tutored by the veteran running back Dominic Rhodes.  After Saturday's game, Manning said: ''He and Dominic have allowed us to run the same plays and be as complex with our offense and our system as we have been in the nine years that I have been here. That is a real credit to both guys, especially a rookie running back.''  A 23-year-old native of Houston, Addai fits into the Colts' low-key locker room. He is quiet and defers to offensive stars like Manning and wide receiver Marvin Harrison.  Addai acknowledged that he was nervous before his first playoff game, but he handled the pressure well.  ''Before the game I was pretty amped up, but when the game started, I settled and was able to relax,'' he said.  Addai had leg cramps during the fourth quarter, but he said he did not expect any lingering problems.  ''Coach Dungy does real good in saving our bodies in practice,'' Addai said. ''I try to take advantage of that.''  During the regular season, Dungy started Rhodes and brought Addai into the game off the bench. But on Saturday, Dungy played a hunch and started Addai.  ''We just felt like this was the time to do it,'' Dungy said. ''We wanted to get some runs early in the game. I think we'll do the same thing this week. It worked pretty well for us.''  Dungy acknowledged that it might be harder for Addai to rush for 100 yards against the Ravens, the Colts' next playoff opponent, Saturday in Baltimore.  ''They play very aggressive, they load the box up, they want not to allow you to run,'' Dungy said of the Ravens. ''We've got to find ways to run. But we'll need to make big plays in the passing game.''  With Addai in the backfield, however, the Colts have a running game that must be respected. Manning is still the catalyst who powers the offense, but Addai is emerging as someone who can carry the running game.  ''We never felt any time that I've been here that our running game wasn't going to be good,'' Dungy said. ''Dominic and Joseph have done a great job all year. We just never really worried about that. You have to be able to run in the postseason. And when people give us looks like we got yesterday, when they were really trying to take away the deep passing game, we feel very confident that we're going to be able to run.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  At halftime Sunday, the score was not knotted, but running back Brian Westbrook's stomach was. The cramps would not dissipate, but neither would Westbrook's determination to keep playing.  As the Giants' Tiki Barber was preparing to retire, Westbrook came into playoff prominence for Philadelphia. He skittered 49 yards for a second-quarter touchdown, then rushed for four first downs on the Eagles' final drive to set up the winning 38-yard field goal in a 23-20 victory.  ''I wasn't feeling very good,'' Westbrook said of his intestinal discomfort after rushing 20 times for 141 yards. But, he added, ''I wouldn't miss being out there.''  Much of his success came on what Philadelphia calls an outside zone play. Right tackle Jon Runyan seals off the inside, and fullback Thomas Tapeh occupies the outside linebacker, leaving Westbrook one on one with a safety or another linebacker. On the final drive in particular, Runyan said, the Giants kept blitzing and Westbrook ran right through the blitz.  ''You have to get positive yards on first down,'' Runyan said. ''It makes it easy for you. The defense doesn't know what you are doing. I don't think we had a third down on that drive until the field goal.''  It was hard to imagine it after Westbrook ran through and around the Giants, but there have long been questions here about him. Not about his ability to run or catch the ball, but about his ability to stay healthy.  Philadelphia threw the football at a rate unmatched in N.F.L. history -- 58.4 percent of the time -- in Coach Andy Reid's eighth season in Philadelphia. The main reason was the lively arm of quarterback Donovan McNabb. But, many suspect, Reid also did not trust that Westbrook could stay healthy enough to carry a punishing load at running back.  In any case, desperation forced Reid's hand.  When McNabb tore a ligament in his knee in November, the Eagles tore up their game plan. Lost was their big-play passing attack. To protect the replacement quarterback, Jeff Garcia, the Eagles grew somewhat cautious. Balance replaced ostentation.  Philadelphia began running as much as it passed in winning five consecutive games to end the regular season and to win the National Football Conference East. And the Eagles kept running during Sunday's wild-card playoff victory against the Giants.  ''He was very patient, and let things develop in front of him, and hit it,'' Reid said of Westbrook. ''It's not speed to the hole; it's speed through the hole. He's developed a good feel for that through the years.''  Before the game, Giants cornerback R. W. McQuarters compared Westbrook to a young Marshall Faulk, meaning that Westbrook was threatening and resourceful at both running and catching the ball. It was no hyperbole. Westbrook led all N.F.L. running backs this season by averaging 6 yards a touch.  ''Brian Westbrook is one of the few elite players in this league,'' said Marty Mornhinweg, the Eagles' offensive coordinator.  On Sunday, Westbrook also returned punts, and sliced through a porous Giants coverage team for a 65-yard return to the end zone that was nullified by a penalty for an illegal block in the back.  But Westbrook's most impressive achievement this season has been running the ball. He gained a career-high 1,217 yards in the regular season and became the first Eagle to rush for at least 1,000 yards while averaging 5 yards a carry.  Until now, there has been frequent and legitimate concern about his durability at 5 feet 8 inches, 203 pounds. He missed the playoffs after the 2003 season with a torn triceps tendon in his left arm. A year ago, his season ended prematurely because of a sprained foot. Earlier this season, Westbrook was bothered by a balky knee, and rumors spread here -- inaccurately -- that he might need surgery.  But he has been resilient and reliable since McNabb became injured, averaging about seven more carries a game.  ''It's a percentage thing,'' Runyan said of Westbrook. ''You give it to him, and he's going to do something with it. He's staying healthy and we're seeing what the guy can do.''  After the Eagles struggled early on Sunday, Westbrook sprinted around the right side from the Giants' 49-yard line early in the second quarter. Defensive end Adrian Awasom dived at Westbrook's feet, but could not bring him down. Safety Will Demps's effort was also futile, as Westbrook stutter-stepped one way, then went the other, jogging into the end zone to tie the score at 7-7.  Then, on the final drive, he exhausted the clock, and the Giants' chances.  ''It was a critical situation, and big-time players step up when you need them the most,'' Westbrook said.

            "text": "  Tom Brady has an impeccable reputation for postseason heroics. But when the Colts beat the Patriots in November, Brady threw four interceptions. And when the Patriots beat the Chargers last week, Brady was picked off three times.  The conclusion?  ''He will throw you some,'' Colts cornerback Nick Harper said. ''No quarterback is perfect. If you have great coverage, sometimes he tends to throw the ball into coverage. I guess he feels like all his receivers are better than the defensive backs. He will throw the ball into coverage. We watched the New England game. He threw a lot of balls to the opposing team, but they didn't catch them.''  Brady and the Patriots, who will face the Colts at the RCA Dome in the A.F.C. championship game Sunday, have beaten the Colts twice recently in the playoffs: in the A.F.C. title game in Foxborough after the 2003 season, and in a second-round game the next year. But the Colts have won regular-season games the past two years.  Brady's play in the November loss was particularly uncharacteristic. It was a low point in a season in which Brady and his revamped corps of receivers struggled to find a chemistry, something that has come together only in recent weeks. Brady threw for 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in the regular season; he never threw more than two interceptions in any other game.  Still, Harper's harsh assessment is likely to find its way to a New England bulletin board this week. His comments stood out on a day when the Colts hewed to the company line that past performance meant nothing in the rivalry.  Brady's postseason record is beyond reproach; he is 12-1 in playoff games, losing only to the Broncos last season. But Harper said he thought Brady's recent struggles against the Indianapolis might be a sign that Colts were planted firmly in his head.  ''I would think so,'' Harper said. ''He knows if he makes a mistake, we're good enough to take advantage of it.''  JUDY BATTISTA  PRO FOOTBALL: PLAYOFF ROUNDUP  ",

            "text": "  Veteran Softie  Sentimental would probably be the last word anyone would use to describe Bill Belichick, but for the second season in a row he gave one of his veteran players a very public farewell gift.  Last season it was allowing the retiring Doug Flutie to convert an extra point with a drop kick in the season finale. On Sunday against the Titans, he inserted Vinny Testaverde, above, the Patriots' third-string quarterback, with less than three minutes remaining so that he could try to throw a touchdown pass for a 20th consecutive season. Testaverde, who had previously played for Belichick with the Browns and the Jets, found Troy Brown for a 6-yard touchdown with 1 minutes 45 seconds left.  Testaverde, 43, and Brown, 35, have the oldest combined ages for players connecting on an N.F.L. touchdown pass, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  While Belichick pumped his fists and the Patriots ran to congratulate Testaverde, some of the Titans were fuming. The score increased the Patriots' lead to 40-23. Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth told reporters: ''To bring in a 50-year-old guy to throw a little pass, probably the last pass of his career or of his life, I don't know. Whatever.''  Nice Job, Kid  While Vinny Testaverde was striking a blow for the older generation Sunday, Jets Coach Eric Mangini was joining a different elite subset.  According to the Elias Sports Bureau, since the 1970 A.F.L.-N.F.L. merger, only two coaches younger than Mangini, 35, have led a team to the playoffs: John Madden (twice, at 33 and 34) and Bill Cowher (35).  Mangini and Testaverde may renew acquaintances when the Jets face the Patriots on Sunday. When Testaverde was the starting quarterback for Cleveland in 1984, Mangini, then 13, was breaking into the league as a Browns ball boy.  Thinking Big  Lost amid the record-breaking seasons of LaDainian Tomlinson and Larry Johnson, San Francisco running back Frank Gore broke the 49ers' franchise record with 1,695 rushing yards. He finished third in the N.F.L. and was named to his first Pro Bowl. But he has bigger plans for next season.  ''I'm going for 2,200 next year,'' Gore told reporters as he cleared out his locker Monday. ''That's the record, isn't it? Yeah, I'll get that.''  That would be Eric Dickerson's single-season record of 2,105 yards, set in 15 games in 1984.  Early Checkout  The consolation for Tom Walsh when he was dismissed as the Raiders' offensive coordinator in November was that he could return to the bed-and-breakfast he had run in Idaho. Oakland players like Randy Moss and Jerry Porter remained stuck in their own version of ''Hotel California'' -- they could check out but never leave.  Walsh had been out of the league since 1994, when he was Art Shell's offensive coordinator in Shell's first stint as Raiders coach. When Walsh rejoined Shell this season and installed his old-school offense of long-developing pass plays, the criticism began mounting.  A few days before the season, Moss said, ''Things are so fishy and question mark around here.'' In September, the former Raiders receiver Tim Brown said Walsh's offense was outdated even in the 1990s, calling it horrible and one-dimensional.  In November, quarterback Andrew Walter said the playbook lacked depth. He was promptly benched.  The result was the league's worst offense, which scored 12 touchdowns, or 72 points, in 16 games. By comparison, the Chargers' LaDainian Tomlinson scored 186 points.  A.F.C. Has Its Way  A.F.C. teams had a 40-24 record against N.F.C. teams during the regular season. Three were 4-0, all of them playoff teams -- New England, San Diego and Kansas City. Over all, A.F.C. playoff teams were 21-3 against the N.F.C. in the regular season. More specifically, A.F.C playoff teams were 6-2 against N.F.C playoff teams. N.F.C. playoff teams were 10-14 against A.F.C. teams, with the Giants faring the best at 3-1.  It Wasn't Luck, He Says  Coach Herman Edwards bristled when reporters suggested that the Chiefs were lucky to qualify for the playoffs. ''We didn't luck our way into it,'' Edwards told The Associated Press on Monday. ''We won our way into it, just like those other teams had to win their way into it. And they didn't do it, to be quite honest.''  The Chiefs (9-7) were the beneficiaries of an unlikely series of events. As Edwards famously said when he was Jets coach, ''You play to win the game.''  But it sure helps when everyone else that matters loses theirs.  The Chiefs first had to hand the Jaguars, who were also contending for a playoff spot, their third straight loss, which they did, 35-30.  Next, they needed the Broncos, the Titans and the Bengals to lose at home. The Broncos lost with less than two minutes left in overtime on a 36-yard field goal. The Titans lost after trailing by 3 points going into the fourth quarter. And the Bengals, who also lost in overtime, missed a game-winning field goal at the end of regulation.  Long-Armed Lion  Jon Kitna had 4,208 passing yards this season for the 3-13 Lions, the 30th time in the past 10 seasons that a quarterback has topped 4,000 yards. But Kitna is only the fifth player in that span to do it for a losing team.  The others are Jeff Garcia (4,278 for the 6-10 49ers in 2000), Elvis Grbac (4,164 for the 7-9 Chiefs in 2000), Peyton Manning (4,131 for the 6-10 Colts in 2001) and Trent Green (4,594 for the 7-9 Chiefs in 2004).  The 306-yard performance by Kitna against Dallas on Sunday could have, at least temporarily, saved his job. The win put the Lions behind the Raiders for the top pick in the 2007 draft and may have put Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn out of reach.  Extra Points  With the Eagles, the Cowboys and the Giants in the playoffs, this is the first time since realignment in 2002 that three teams from the same division have reached the postseason. The last time that happened was 2001, when three teams from the A.F.C. East (New England, Miami and the Jets) and the N.F.C. Central (Chicago, Tampa Bay and Green Bay) made the playoffs.  Shaun Alexander extended his league record for games with at least one 10-yard run to 64, a span of more than four full seasons.  PRO FOOTBALL  Correction:  January 9, 2007, Tuesday  A report in the Fifth Down football roundup on Thursday about the American Football Conference's dominance over the National Football Conference during the regular season misstated the N.F.C. playoff team that had the best record (3-1) against A.F.C. teams. It is the Dallas Cowboys -- not the Giants, who were 1-3.  ",

This year, the anniversary of his hiring coincided with the day set aside to remember the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  The confluence of the two events on the calendar seemed fitting considering Smith is one of two African-American coaches whose teams are among the four left in the N.F.L. playoffs. The Indianapolis Colts' Tony Dungy is the other. ''I hope for a day when it is unnoticed,'' said Smith, referring to his skin color. ''That day isn't here.

            "text": "  FOXBOROUGH, Mass., Jan. 18 -- If the New England Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts and advance to the Super Bowl, it will be a milestone for their 43-year-old backup quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, who has never reached the Super Bowl in 20 N.F.L. seasons.  \"Every year I watch it, I think, 'Got away from me again,' \" Testaverde said. \"Hopefully, this year will be a little different.\"  The chance to win the Super Bowl, and another chance to play for Bill Belichick, lured Testaverde out of a brief retirement when he signed with the Patriots on Nov. 14 as a backup to Tom Brady. Testaverde's main role is to offer advice and encouragement as a stable presence in a locker room already loaded with experience.  The quarterback duel between Brady and Peyton Manning will be a dominant theme during Sunday's American Football Conference championship game, and Brady has the upper hand, with three Super Bowl titles and two playoff victories over Manning.  Because of those losses, and his failure to reach the Super Bowl, Manning has been targeted for criticism despite a brilliant career. But Testaverde finds it hard to fathom that Manning does not have the makeup to lead a team to a championship,  \"I don't know Peyton personally as well as I do Tom, but I think from what I've seen, he has a lot of the same instincts and ability as Tom does,\" Testaverde said. \"He's obviously one of the best. A lot of people don't give him as much credit as he deserves, because he hasn't won the big game yet. It's more than one player when it comes to winning in this sport. A guy as good as he is, sooner or later, he's going to get one, he's going to get a ring.\"  Though Testaverde barely played this season, a personal high point occurred Dec. 31, when he threw a touchdown pass to Troy Brown during the Patriots' 40-23 victory over Tennessee. The pass was completed with less than two minutes left in the game, and some Titans were not happy. But Belichick wanted Testaverde to become the first N.F.L. player to throw touchdown passes in 20 consecutive seasons, and Testaverde appreciated the opportunity.  \"I didn't expect to go in the game at that point, and then when I did, I really didn't think we were going to be throwing the football,\" Testaverde said. \"That situation shows that he does have a sense of history. He lets the team know the accomplishments of certain guys, because guys are proud to be a part of it, too.\"  Even if the Patriots win the Super Bowl, Testaverde did not guarantee that he would retire -- again.  \"This is what I love to do,\" he said. \"I can't think of anything better, and this is a great situation.\"  FOUR PATRIOTS ARE AILING At least four Patriots had flu symptoms Thursday, three days before New England takes on Indianapolis in the A.F.C. championship game.  Receiver Troy Brown, linebacker Tedy Bruschi, offensive tackle Ryan O'Callaghan and defensive tackle Mike Wright were ailing, but all were expected to be available for Sunday's game.  The hard-hitting safety Rodney Harrison, one of New England's key defensive players, was on the field at the beginning of Thursday's practice, although he missed the previous two playoff games with a knee injury. His status for Sunday was uncertain. Only the beginning of practice was open to the news media, so it was not known how much Harrison participated.  ",

            "text": "  A season of adversity for the Seattle Seahawks fittingly ended with frustration.  Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime Sunday gave the Chicago Bears a 27-24 victory and ended the Seahawks' bid to repeat as the National Football Conference champions. A season ago, Seattle rolled to the conference's best record and reached the Super Bowl. But this season was filled with obstacles.  Many important players missed time with injuries, including quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and running back Shaun Alexander. The departure of left guard Steve Hutchinson to Minnesota via free agency hurt Seattle's running game. Finally, after escaping last week with a 1-point victory against Dallas in their playoff opener, the Seahawks ran out of answers here.  Just like last season, when the Seahawks felt demoralized after losing to Pittsburgh in the Super Bowl, their locker room was filled with quiet players with dejected faces.  ''This will be one that we think about for a long time,'' Hasselbeck said. ''I guess this just isn't our year. Last year, things came easier for us. Very few guys got hurt, our offensive line was healthy all season, everything was easier. This year was more like what most teams go through. But I'm proud of this team, the way we kept fighting.''  Seattle became the first Super Bowl loser since the 1999 Tennessee Titans to make the playoffs the next season. Sunday's loss, however, was filled with missed opportunities. They had the ball first in overtime but could not score. And on the ensuing punt, Ryan Plackemeier's 18-yard kick failed to pin down the Bears and gave them the ball at their 34 for the final drive.  Plackemeier said he rushed the punt when he was pressured.  ''I've got to learn to trust my protection,'' he said. ''A bad punt in that situation is not what we need.''  Early in the game, Seattle squandered another chance. On Chicago's opening drive, a pass by Bears quarterback Rex Grossman deflected off the hands of defensive back Jordan Babineaux and into the arms of Chicago's Rashied Davis for a 37-yard gain. Three plays later, the Bears scored a touchdown to take the lead, and Grossman's confidence was boosted.  How would Grossman have reacted if his pass had been intercepted by Babineaux on the game's opening drive? The Seahawks will never know, but Babineaux could not get that play out of his mind.  ''The ball slipped right through my hands,'' said Babineaux, who was also beaten in overtime when Davis made a 30-yard reception that helped set up Gould's winning field goal. ''A lot of people didn't think we should be here, but we knew we could line up and play with anybody.''  With Hasselbeck and Alexander returning, Seattle has the nucleus to be a contender for several seasons. But that did not ease the pain.  ''The finality of losing a playoff game this week hurts,'' Seahawks Coach Mike Holmgren said. ''I hope down the road, we get a few more cracks at this thing.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  The long path to respect and recognition was about to be completed by Louisville. The Cardinals had only recently raised their national profile with the move to the Big East from Conference USA two seasons ago, and the Orange Bowl on Tuesday night at Dolphin Stadium was to be the final step in Louisville's ascension to the short list of national contenders for next season.  If only the No. 5 Cardinals could beat a Wake Forest team dismissed by some as an opportunistic champion in a down year for the Atlantic Coast Conference.  The No. 15 Demon Deacons, accustomed to being underrated and underestimated, made it much harder than Louisville fans might have preferred. But in the end, the Cardinals earned their place with a 24-13 victory against Wake Forest in front of 74,470 in the first Bowl Championship Series game for these programs on the rise.  In a game defined by defense through most of three quarters, it was the offenses that finally took over in the fourth. And that was why high-powered Louisville won. Cardinals quarterback Brian Brohm, the game's most valuable player, directed an eight-play, 81-yard drive that was capped by a 1-yard touchdown run by Anthony Allen with 12 minutes 31 seconds remaining to give the Cardinals a 17-13 lead.  Brohm completed 24 of 34 for 312 yards, third most in Orange Bowl history behind Tom Brady of Michigan and Matt Leinart of Southern California.  ''Just to be mentioned with those guys' names is a special thing,'' Brohm said.  Brock Bolen added an 18-yard touchdown run with 4:55 remaining to seal the victory for Louisville (12-1). The Cardinals could begin next season among the leading contenders for the national championship if Brohm and the injured running back Michael Bush return instead of entering the N.F.L. draft.  After the game, fans chanted ''One more year!'' and Brohm said, ''Right now, coming back and trying to win the national title is very appealing.''  Wake Forest (11-3) completed its best season in team history with the A.C.C. championship and its first 11-win season.  ''I told the kids in the locker room after the game to be really proud of what we've accomplished,'' Wake Forest Coach Jim Grobe said. ''It's funny. You get in the Orange Bowl and being in the Orange Bowl feels really, really good. But when you lose, it doesn't feel any different than when you lose any other time.''  The game was not the offensive barrage that Louisville fans had come to expect from a Cardinals team that came in scoring 38.9 points a game. Wake Forest, with a defense that posted a 30-0 shutout at Florida State earlier in the season and advanced to the Orange Bowl with a 9-6 victory over Georgia Tech in the A.C.C. title game, would not have it.  Indeed, it took a trick play for the Cardinals to take a 10-3 lead at halftime. And Wake Forest erased that deficit on its first drive of the second half, when Riley Skinner completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Nate Morton three and a half minutes into the third quarter to tie the score at 10-10. It was the first touchdown in six quarters for the Demon Deacons, dating to a victory at Maryland on Nov. 25.  Wake Forest appeared on its way to taking the lead later in the quarter, but running back Rich Belton fumbled at the Louisville 14-yard line.  After a scoreless first quarter, Wake Forest took the first lead when Sam Swank kicked a 44-yard field goal 43 seconds into the second quarter. How dominant were the defenses? The score came after a Demon Deacons drive that went exactly one yard. Wake Forest had gained the field position on what appeared to be a partly blocked punt that went just 14 yards and gave the Demon Deacons the ball on Louisville's 28. This came after a first quarter in which Wake Forest was held to 24 total yards of offense, including minus-27 yards rushing.  Still, the Demon Deacons were in the game because Louisville's offense was not much more productive. The Cardinals totaled 34 yards in the opening quarter, with the highly touted Brohm managing just 8 yards on 2-of-4 passing.  A poor punt by Swank set up the lone touchdown of the first half. It came on an option pass from wide receiver Patrick Carter, a former quarterback, who took a lateral from Brohm near the right sideline and threw across the field to an open Allen on the far side of the field. He easily ran in for the 21-yard touchdown reception and a 10-3 Louisville lead with 5:53 to go in the half.  Although there has been much speculation about Brohm's future and the possibility he could pass up his senior season and enter the N.F.L. draft, it was a redshirt freshman, Skinner, who put up more impressive numbers in the first half. Skinner was 10 of 13 for 124 yards; Brohm was 7 of 13 for 79 yards.  Skinner finished 21 of 33 for 272 yards with a touchdown and an interception.  FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  It's decision time for the Giants' president, John Mara, and the Tisch brothers, Steve, the team chairman, and Jonathan, the treasurer:  To support or sack Tom Coughlin as coach. To name a general manager to replace the retiring Ernie Accorsi.  For all the commotion in recent weeks over Coughlin's future and despite the Giants' gallant 23-20 loss to the Eagles yesterday in the opening round of the Super Bowl XLI playoffs, the thinking here is that Coughlin deserves to stay as the coach and that Jerry Reese, the director of player personnel, should be anointed as the general manager.  When the injury-depleted Giants tumbled into a 1-6 tailspin before salvaging an 8-8 record and a wild card, yes, Coughlin was the coach. But until that streak, Coughlin was the coach of mostly healthy Giants teams that over the 2005 season and half of this season were 17-7, not including a 23-0 loss to Carolina in the playoffs a year ago.  When Mara (who has one vote as co-owner) and the Tisch brothers (who have one vote between them representing their co-ownership) sit down to judge Coughlin, they need to remember that 17-7 run when the Giants were mostly healthy, not just the 1-6 tailspin.  Mara and the Tisch brothers also need to remember that, whatever the eventual playoff disappointments, under Coughlin the Giants qualified for the playoffs in consecutive seasons. That had not happened since the 1989 and 1990 teams in Bill Parcells's last two years as the Giants' coach.  Mara and the Tisch brothers also need to ask themselves: If we dismiss Coughlin, is an obvious successor available?  The popular candidate would be Charlie Weis, the Notre Dame coach who made his reputation as the Patriots' offensive coordinator and sculptor of quarterback Tom Brady. But before Notre Dame's 41-14 loss to Louisiana State on Wednesday in the Sugar Bowl, Weis insisted that he intended to stay in South Bend until his son Charlie, an eighth grader, graduates from Notre Dame.  As the Dolphins learned when Nick Saban accepted the University of Alabama job, coaches can, and have, often changed their minds about going elsewhere, but seldom does a coach, as a father, link a son to the timetable of his future.  As a coach, Weis also has much to prove. Over his two seasons at Notre Dame, he has produced a 19-6 record, but two of those losses were in Bowl Championship Series games, to Ohio State a year ago and to L.S.U. last week. He acknowledged having a ''nice, solid team,'' but said that ''you want to be an upper-echelon team'' to compete for a national championship.  If the Giants' job were open, another people's choice would surely be Parcells, if he were to leave the Cowboys after Saturday night's painful 21-20 loss in Seattle on Tony Romo's botched field-goal hold. But at 65, Parcells may, finally, decide to stay retired. Then again, he has been known to change his mind.  Three years ago, Weis was interviewed for the Giants' job along with Lovie Smith, now the Bears' coach, and Romeo Crennel, now the Browns' coach, as well as Coughlin -- in retrospect a formidable foursome. Coughlin was at liberty, having been out of football for a year after his firing at Jacksonville. He had quickly molded the expansion Jaguars into a four-time playoff team before sagging to a 6-10 record in each of his final two seasons.  Although some new assistants will probably join Coughlin's staff, the Giants don't need a new head coach as much as they need a running back who will approach the yardage supplied by the retiring Tiki Barber, a more accurate and more assertive Eli Manning at quarterback and a dominating pass-rusher to replace the battered Michael Strahan. They also need healthy comebacks from season-ending injuries to wide receiver Amani Toomer and linebacker LaVar Arrington.  As for the identity of the new general manager, who will be responsible for acquiring new and better players, three candidates besides Reese, all in the front office, have been interviewed: Chris Mara, the vice president for player evaluation; Kevin Abrams, the assistant general manager; and Dave Gettleman, the director of pro personnel.  If it takes one to know one, Accorsi, who was hired by George Young as his successor, has recommended Reese to be his successor.  Chris Mara, who is John's younger brother, is certainly qualified as a longtime Giants scout as well as an Arena Football League team general manager, but choosing him would open the Giants to complaints of nepotism. It would also make Chris Mara a possible target for change after losing seasons. If he retains his current title, he will continue to have as much input on player evaluation, for free agents and draft choices, without a bull's-eye on his back.  But those decisions on the coach and the general manager are for John Mara and the Tisch brothers to make. And make quickly. With the scouting combine only a few weeks away, next season is about to begin.  SPORTS OF THE TIMES  ",

            "text": "  For a trip to the Super Bowl, Bill Belichick and Tony Dungy were willing to take chances.  Both Belichick and Dungy coached aggressively during Sunday's American Football Conference championship game. Belichick, the New England Patriots' coach, set the tone, giving his team early momentum by choosing to go for a first down, rather than punt, on two occasions during the first half. Both times, the Patriots made Belichick look good, converting the first down. And on both of those drives, the Patriots scored a touchdown.  The Patriots built a 21-3 lead and stayed aggressive throughout. Leading by 34-31 with 3 minutes 22 seconds remaining, they appeared to be going for the kill, rather than trying to kill the clock. They ran three straight passing plays and did not get a first down. New England was forced to punt after running only a minute off the clock.  The Colts scored 1:17 later, aided greatly by a roughing the passer penalty on Tully Banta-Cain, to win, 38-34.  Belichick's first gamble came less than seven minutes into the game, facing a fourth-and-1 from the Colts' 48-yard line. The game was still scoreless, and many coaches would have decided to punt, hoping to pin the Colts deep in their own territory.  Not Belichick, who has a penchant for becoming more aggressive during the playoffs, contrary to coaches who become more conservative. The Patriots made the first down with a huge play, when Corey Dillon ran through a gaping hole and rumbled 35 yards to the Colts' 13-yard line. Three plays later, the Patriots scored a weird touchdown, when offensive guard Logan Mankins recovered a fumble in the end zone after a wild scramble.  Leading by 7-3 early in the second quarter, Belichick gambled again with the Patriots facing fourth-and-6 from the Colts' 34. Belichick could have called for a punt, or for a long field-goal attempt by the rookie place-kicker Stephen Gostkowski. Instead, Belichick turned to quarterback Tom Brady, something he has done often.  ''I'll go back to another saying that I think would define my philosophy as a coach,'' Belichick said Thursday. ''In critical situations, think of players, not plays. I think a lot of coaches live by that motto. When it comes to a critical situation, you want your best playmakers critically involved in the play.''  On the fourth-and-6 play, Brady found a familiar target, wide receiver Troy Brown, running free in the middle of the field. The fourth-down pass play from Brady to Brown covered 27 yards, giving the Patriots first-and-goal at the 7. On the next play, Dillon rumbled into the end zone to give the Patriots a 14-3 edge.  But the Colts rallied, giving Dungy a chance to show his gambler's mentality. With just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter, Peyton Manning threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to defensive tackle Dan Klecko, who had come in on offense, to pull the Colts within 21-19, then Dungy called for a 2-point conversion. The Colts had more than a quarter to catch up, and they could have kicked an extra point to pull within a point.  But Dungy wanted to catch up immediately. His decision paid off, when Manning connected with Marvin Harrison in the end zone for the conversion, tying the score.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  The locker room was quiet, players spoke in hushed tones, and the New England Patriots felt as empty as many of their past victims.  This was an unfamiliar finish for the Patriots, losing an 18-point second-quarter lead and the American Football Conference championship game. Sunday's 38-34 victory by the Indianapolis Colts will be remembered as a classic playoff game, but for the Patriots, the second half was a nightmare.  They were shredded by Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis offense. They dropped passes. They committed key penalties. And in the end, quarterback Tom Brady ran out of magic and time.  Having won three Super Bowls in the past five seasons, the Patriots saw the opportunity to win another snatched away. There will be plenty of time for self-analysis. But immediately afterward, the prevailing feeling among the Patriots was disappointment.  ''It'll take a good while to swallow this one,'' said linebacker Tedy Bruschi, a member of the Patriots' three Super Bowl winners. ''I put so much into this season. I'm really emotional right now. This game was momentum swings on top of momentum swings. And theirs was the one that finished it.''  The Colts dissected New England's proud defense in the second half, scoring on five of seven second-half possessions, not counting the knee that Manning took to end the game. The Patriots could not stop the Colts when it counted most. They were protecting a 34-31 lead with 2 minutes 17 seconds to play, when Indianapolis regained possession on its 20.  From that point, Manning engineered a drive that will take its place in N.F.L. lore, moving the Colts 80 yards in seven plays for the winning touchdown, a 3-yard run by Joseph Addai.  Uncharacteristically, the Patriots surrendered yardage in chunks during that decisive drive. Manning completed a 32-yard pass to Bryan Fletcher and another for 14 yards to Reggie Wayne.  On that play, Patriots defensive end Tully Banta-Cain was penalized for roughing the passer, moving the ball from New England's 23-yard line to the 11 with 1:53 left.  Without that penalty, perhaps the Colts would have settled for a tying field goal that would probably have forced overtime. Instead, the Colts called Addai's number on three consecutive running plays, the final one resulting in a touchdown.  That left the Patriots trailing by 4 points with 54 seconds and two timeouts remaining. when they took over at their 21.  Even for Brady, this was a nearly impossible situation. Four plays later, he tried to force a pass to Ben Watson that was intercepted by Marlin Jackson with 16 seconds to play. Indianapolis could celebrate. The Patriots could reflect.  ''We just let too many opportunities slip away,'' said Brady, who completed 21 of 34 passes, for 232 yards and a touchdown. ''The last pass, you're just trying to force it, make a play. In hindsight, you probably should throw it away. But time was an issue.  ''It's frustrating for all of us when it ends like this, because the expectations are high. We just have to come back next year and try to do it better.''  The Patriots appeared to have the Colts on the run in the second quarter, after New England defensive back Asante Samuel cut in front of a pass intended for Marvin Harrison and returned the ball 39 yards for a touchdown. The extra point gave the Patriots a 21-3 lead, and they stopped Indianapolis on its next drive.  But after reaching the Colts' 27, the Patriots committed back-to-back penalties and eventually punted.  That gave the Colts a chance to regroup, and they managed a 12-play drive for a field goal that pulled them to 21-6 at halftime.  In the second half, the Colts' offensive machine clicked, and the Patriots at times looked tired and a step slow.  ''They're a high-powered offense,'' Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel said. ''We knew the game wasn't over.''  Asked if he was disappointed that the Patriots could not generate more of a pass rush against Manning, defensive end Ty Warren said: ''You not only have to get to him, you have to get to him quick. They run timing patterns. If you don't get there, the ball is gone.''  The Patriots had a chance to run out the clock, getting the ball with 3:32 left and leading by 34-31. But they were stopped after three plays, giving Manning the opportunity to orchestrate his final drive.  So instead of going to another Super Bowl, Brady will be watching it. Or will he?  ''Knowing me, probably not,'' Brady said. ''Probably not.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  There is nothing subtle about Jeremy Shockey. His hair is surfer-dude blond, his arms are emblazoned with tattoos, and he barks at opponents and officials when things do not bounce his way.  Shockey's teammates would not change him one bit.  ''He's our emotional leader,'' center Shaun O'Hara said before practice Thursday. ''Sometimes for good, sometimes for bad. But you know you're going to get the same thing from him every time, and I love him for it. I wouldn't want anybody else out there.''  There is a chance the Giants will have to play with the backup tight end Visanthe Shiancoe instead of Shockey in Sunday's wild-card game in Philadelphia. Shockey, who practiced Thursday for the first time since injuring his left ankle against the New Orleans Saints on Dec. 24, was listed as questionable. Coach Tom Coughlin said Shockey was making progress.  When Shiancoe has started in place of Shockey, the Giants' offense has changed considerably. Shiancoe is widely regarded as a blocking tight end; Shockey led the team this season with 66 receptions.  But in terms of confidence and self-promotion, Shiancoe and Shockey appear to be on equal footing.  ''Look, man, I'm 6-5, 255 pounds,'' said Shiancoe, who is listed as 6-4 and 250 pounds in the Giants' media guide. ''I run a 4.5. I'm strong as -- excuse me -- hell. So I can basically do anything the coaches tell me to do, and they know that.''  He added, ''If Shockey is not able to go, of course I could get 100 yards.''  That would be a first. Shiancoe had a career-high 12 catches this season for 81 yards and no touchdowns. He has never caught a pass longer than 17 yards in his career.  But Shiancoe might be a better blocker than Shockey, who was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl this season. And he certainly seems to be more durable. Shiancoe has played in every game since being drafted by the Giants in the third round in 2003, while Shockey has missed 11 games in five seasons.  The swollen ankle forced Shockey to miss last Saturday's regular-season finale in Washington.  ''I just felt like I couldn't compete as hard as Visanthe Shiancoe and the other guys,'' Shockey said Wednesday when asked about not playing against the Redskins. ''They got an opportunity and they did very well.''  Shiancoe started in Washington and had 1 reception for 8 yards in the Giants' 34-28 victory. Tiki Barber rushed for a club-record 234 yards on 23 carries. Coincidence? Shiancoe said he did not think so, and he may have had a point. The Giants appeared to stick with the running game longer than they would have had Shockey been available.  The Giants also did not miss a beat when Shockey was limited by an injured right ankle at the start of the season. They won six of their first eight games with Shiancoe occasionally filling in. With Shockey sidelined in the overtime of the Giants' 30-24 victory in Philadelphia on Sept. 17, Shiancoe wrested away a 9-yard pass from safety Brian Dawkins, sustaining the game-winning drive.  But Shockey is clearly a better fit in the offense. When Barber was asked Tuesday about the impact Shockey's absence had in Washington, he said: ''We were forced to run the ball. It hurts our intermediate pass game, and this is not a slight on Shiancoe at all. But he's inexperienced in there.''  Barber, who ran for touchdowns of 15, 55 and 50 yards against the Redskins, added that Shiancoe was a good blocker.  ''I try to maul people, man,'' Shiancoe said about the subtleties of blocking. ''Tiki's all over the place, man. You don't know where he's going to go. And usually, for some reason, he follows behind me.''  Even if Shockey is healthy enough to play Sunday, Shiancoe will likely work up a sweat. He started three games in which the Giants opened with dual tight-end sets, and he is a fixture on special teams, playing on most kickoff returns and field-goal attempts.  But if Shockey is on the field, Shiancoe's role will be limited at best. Still, he insisted he was not bothered by being overshadowed by Shockey.  ''Everyone thinks that they're starters,'' Shiancoe said. ''Nobody wants their whole career to not be really a strong part of the offense. But it's my role here -- the backup tight end.''

            "text": "  Laveranues Coles's face brightened when somebody mentioned the block he made to help spring running back Leon Washington on his 15-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter of the Jets' 23-3 victory against the Oakland Raiders.  ''I think that explains me totally,'' Coles said. ''I can go out and make all the catches in the world, but I think the most important things I do are the little things. I take more pride in blocking and watching other guys score and stuff like that than anything.''  Quarterback Chad Pennington threw to Coles twice unsuccessfully in the end zone, but on Sunday he was mostly used as a decoy, drawing double-teams to open the field for Jerricho Cotchery, who had 7 catches for 53 yards, and Justin McCareins, who caught 5 passes for 27 yards.  Coles had two catches to finish the regular season with a career-high 91, one more than he had in 2004 with the Washington Redskins. It was by design that Coles did not run many routes across the middle; the game plan was to keep him out of harm's way as much as possible. He was playing six days after sustaining a concussion in a helmet-to-helmet hit in the second quarter of the Jets' 13-10 victory at Miami.  Coles played the second half against the Dolphins but did not practice all week.  ''He's pretty banged up right now,'' Cotchery said. ''He's a warrior. To see him take the hit he took last week when he didn't know where he was at and come back to play today is amazing to me.''  Jets Coach Eric Mangini does not talk about injuries and has made it clear that he expects his players to follow his lead. Coles was asked repeatedly about the state of his health after the game and, per Mangini's edict, refused to comment.  ''Ask me about the playoffs,'' he said.  One reporter's persistent questioning about Coles's head injury led to a shouting match between the two that ended with two Jets employees stepping in to restrain them.  ''I'm sorry you had to see that,'' Coles said after cooling down.  Coles's toughness continues to impress Mangini, who said: ''He's different than other guys who say, 'I'm O.K. but. ' He says, 'I'm O.K.' He's so tough he doesn't give you anything.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  The Arizona Diamondbacks took the next step toward completing a five-player trade with the Yankees yesterday, agreeing to a two-year contract with pitcher Randy Johnson, one of Johnson's agents, Alan Nero, said.  Johnson had one year and $16 million left on his previous contract. The new contract, which goes through the 2008 season, is worth $26 million, so it essentially serves as a one-year extension for about $10 million.  The Yankees included $2 million when they agreed to trade Johnson to the Diamondbacks on Thursday for the veteran right-handed reliever Luis Vizca\u00edno and three prospects.  Starting Thursday afternoon, Johnson and the Diamondbacks had a 72-hour window to negotiate a contract. The deal was completed before the window expired yesterday at 5 p.m. Eastern.  Johnson, 43, has 280 career victories and will probably need two more seasons to reach 300.  For the deal to become official, Johnson must pass a physical today and the trade must be approved by Commissioner Bud Selig because it involves the signing of a new contract.  Johnson had back surgery this off-season to repair a herniated disk. Nero said that Johnson should have no trouble passing the physical but that he was not sure if he would be ready to pitch by opening day.  If Johnson passes the physical, the Diamondbacks will probably have a news conference tomorrow to announce his return.  Johnson pitched for Arizona from 1999 to 2004, then was traded to the Yankees before the 2005 season.  In two uneven years in New York, Johnson had an uneasy relationship with the news media and posted the highest earned run average of his career (5.00 in 2006), though he won 17 games each season.  CAIRO TO RETURN -- The Yankees have come to terms on a one-year, $750,000 contract with infielder Miguel Cairo.  The deal to re-sign Cairo, first reported by The New York Post, should solidify the Yankees' infield for next season. In 81 games for the Yankees last season, Cairo batted .239 and played four infield positions and left field.  Cairo also played for the Yankees in 2004 and was a member of the Mets in 2005.

            "text": "  The Florida Gators navigated their way through a grueling Southeastern Conference schedule, mastering the art of winning ugly.  They relied on a stout defense, a jury-rigged offense and a pinch of serendipity to reach the Bowl Championship Series title game Monday night.  But in a 41-14 mauling of top-ranked Ohio State, the No. 2 Gators left little to chance.  Led by the brilliance of the senior quarterback Chris Leak, the boundless creativity of the offensive coordinator Dan Mullen and the dominance of defensive end Derrick Harvey, Florida stunned college football by blowing the undefeated Buckeyes off the field.  The victory completed one of the most unlikely runs to the national title in recent college football history. Coach Urban Meyer's Gators grinded through the regular season with a collection of close victories, and they would not have made it here if Southern California had not been upset by U.C.L.A. on the regular season's final day.  But once they got here, the Gators (13-1) appeared undaunted. The victory secured their second national title in football, and it made Florida the first university to hold football and men's basketball national titles at the same time.  The Buckeyes (12-1) had the country's top defense, the Heisman Trophy winner in quarterback Troy Smith, and the nation's No. 1 ranking from the start of the season.  But this game proved to be a microcosm of their season, starting with a bang and ending with a thud. Ted Ginn Jr. returned the game's opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown. From that point, though, almost nothing went right for the Buckeyes.  Ohio State, which had not played since Nov. 18, set up Florida's first two touchdown drives with personal foul penalties, set up the next two with turnovers and never got Smith in rhythm.  Smith finished the game 4 of 14 for 35 yards, with an interception, and he had minus-29 yards rushing on 10 attempts. Ohio State had trailed after halftime just once during the regular season, and the Buckeyes never looked comfortable trying to scrape back from the 20-point halftime deficit.  ''They moved the ball down the field all season on tape,'' Florida cornerback Ryan Smith said, ''but when they saw our front four, they couldn't do anything about it.''  Troy Smith said: ''Not everything in life is going to go the exact way you want it. I don't have any regrets, though. I really don't. We came out and fought. We came up short.''  With all that dominance, there were a few dollops of good fortune for Florida. The oft-ridiculed place-kicker Chris Hetland, who had made only 4 of 13 field-goal attempts all season, knocked in first-half kicks from 42 and 40 yards. Also aiding Florida was a first-quarter ankle injury to Ginn, who said he was injured celebrating his touchdown. Ginn did not play the final three quarters and was on crutches in the second half.  But history will best remember the lopsided tenor of the game, which Leak set by leading near-flawless touchdown drives of 46, 34 and 71 yards on Florida's first three possessions. Leak's accuracy -- he completed his first nine passes and 25 of 36 for 212 yards and a touchdown -- combined with the ingenuity of Meyer's spread offense, led to the offensive onslaught.  Leak entered Florida as one of the nation's top high school recruits and was the starter midway through his freshman season. He had an up-and-down career, though, and he was forced to endure boos from the fans in Gainesville this season.  On Monday, he lived up to his advance billing.  ''He was unbelievable,'' said Mullen, the offensive coordinator. ''This is what he came here for. He came here to win championships, and that's what he did tonight.''  Ryan Smith said: ''A lot of people don't realize he's in the best league, playing against the best defense. He played great tonight.''  Three different players lined up at quarterback in Florida's first eight offensive snaps. The Gators used reverses, pitches to wide receivers and draw plays to keep Ohio State off balance.  Florida's four first-half touchdowns showcased its offensive diversity, as the Gators picked apart a defense that led the nation in scoring defense, allowing 10.4 points a game.  But Florida's scoring came early and often. The first touchdown, tying the score at 7-7, came when Leak threw a 14-yard pass to Dallas Baker, who beat Buckeyes corner Malcolm Jenkins thanks to a deft Leak pump fake. The next score came when Leak pitched to wide receiver Percy Harvin for a 4-yard touchdown run.  Florida took a 21-7 lead when tailback DeShawn Wynn muscled up the middle for a 2-yard run out of a strange formation with three running backs stacked up in a straight line. The backup quarterback Tim Tebow completed the first-half scoring when he threw a 1-yard touchdown to Andre Caldwell on a third-and-goal play.  That sent Ohio State into halftime trailing by 34-14 and left Mullen looking like a sideline wizard with his endless array of formations, presnap motions and near-flawless execution. (Leak's first three misses after hitting his first nine passes were intentional throwaways.)  Harvey, Florida's star sophomore defensive end, derailed two Ohio State drives with sacks of Smith that showcased his speed.  Harvey ran down Smith for a 7-yard loss on a third down during Ohio State's first offensive possession. On the Buckeyes' second possession, he warped the drive with a 10-yard sack on first down. That drive ended with an interception by Reggie Lewis on a third-and-14 after cornerback Ryan Smith blasted Troy Smith with a blitz.  Harvey added an exclamation point to his dominant first half when he recovered the ball after Jarvis Moss forced a Smith fumble. That gave Florida the ball on the Ohio State 5 and set up the final score of an astonishingly dominant half.  ''Honestly, we've played a lot better teams than them,'' Moss said. ''I could name four or five teams in the SEC that could probably compete with them and play the same type of game we did against them.''  Smith's fumble capped a miserable first half, as both his fumble and interception led to Gators scores. Six of the past seven Heisman Trophy winners who have played for the national title have now lost. Matt Leinart, who led U.S.C. to a blowout of Oklahoma in the 2004 B.C.S. title game, is the only exception.  Florida's only loss this season came in its seventh game, to Auburn, 27-17, on Oct. 14. They capped the regular season by beating Arkansas in the SEC title game on Dec. 2.  ''We became a better team every game as the season went on,'' Ryan Smith said. ''In the last game of the season, the national championship, we played our best game.''  A team that got to this game in the most improbable fashion put a thumping on the Buckeyes that even the widest-eyed Gators optimist could not have conceived.  And Monday night, Florida and Ohio State proved for this game and this season, that people do not remember how you start. They will only remember where you finish.  COLLEGE FOOTBALL  ",

            "text": "  WHO -- Wyndi Gundrum-Cooper, 47, a real estate agent from Ocean Isle Beach, N.C.  WHAT -- Studio condominium  WHERE -- Charleston, S.C.  I've been visiting Charleston for 15 years, I even honeymooned here, and it's a place where I've always wanted to own a home. I looked for years, but of course the closer I got to the city center, the higher the cost. I discovered this little gem about a year ago. It's 320 square feet with a 100-square-foot courtyard. When I bought it, it needed work. I redid the bathroom, since the only thing holding it up was the tile, and turned the full kitchen into a kitchenette.  The biggest thing in the apartment is the fireplace. It's 84 inches, while the kitchenette is only 54 inches across. But a big fireplace is part of the historic nature of this 200-year-old building. It's only two rooms but proved to be the hardest two rooms I've ever had to decorate. Though it's the smallest unit in the building, I wouldn't think about giving up my courtyard for a bigger space.  I live at the beach, so when I want to get away, I come here. We're two and a half hours away and make it here about twice a month. Generally my husband, Ron Cooper, and I will arrive late on a Friday night. We park the car out front and don't move it again until we leave at the end of the weekend. The condo is right on Queen Street, so we can walk to shopping on King Street and to restaurants. Charleston has a growing gallery district, and we are right in the heart of it. But when I first arrive, I just love to spend time in our home.  I never say I have a place in Charleston. I don't want people to think that I have a mansion in the city or one of the newer, grand apartments, so instead, I always say that I have ''a space'' in Charleston.

            "text": "  PEOPLE interested in buying brownstones or town houses should not assume that all of the bargains are gone. Brokers say there are still properties in New York City that cost less than $1 million, but only if buyers are willing to venture into often overlooked neighborhoods and tolerate extensive renovations.  ''You can still get a lovely brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant for well under $1 million,'' said William S. Ross, executive director of sales for Halstead Property in Brooklyn. ''The market begins around $650,000 to $700,000 for a real four-story brownstone.''  Because brownstones in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights have been less appealing to renovators than those in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope and Carroll Gardens, many still have original details, Mr. Ross said. These often include fireplace mantels, tall parlor windows and high ceilings.  Mr. Ross, who owns a brownstone in Cobble Hill, warns buyers to invest upfront in advisers -- like engineers knowledgeable about brownstones -- who can identify all of the costly problems that inevitably arise. If a brownstone in a historic district needs a new facade, for instance, that alone can cost $100,000, he said. Restoration work can also be pricey -- restoring moldings in a living room can cost $40,000.  But buyers say that these changes can be worth the hassle. In 2002, Florence Clutch, now a vice president at Halstead, bought a brownstone in Crown Heights for about $350,000. She spent about $150,000 in renovations like updating the electricity and replacing the water main, to increase water pressure. Now she rents out three floors and believes she could sell her property for three times the purchase price. Ms. Clutch says that 8 to 10 brownstones in Crown Heights typically come up for sale each year.  There are always houses on the market requiring renovation. One of Ms. Clutch's listings, a two-family town home at 1318 Prospect Place in Park Slope offered at $559,000, will require ''tons'' of investment from a buyer, in cosmetic renovations and in dealing with current tenants, she said.  A town house for sale in Bedford-Stuyvesant, at 177 Nostrand Avenue, was recently reduced in price to $620,000 from $640,000. The broker, Malik Mitchell, who is an executive vice president for Century 21 NY Metro, estimated that the buyer would have to spend about $40,000 to make the walls and floors presentable.  A buyer would also have to deal with the city bureaucracy to get the home's classification changed to a three-family from the current two-family, if he or she wanted to legally rent out the already renovated basement apartment.  While most empty shells of brownstones in Harlem fetch more than $1 million, Prudential Douglas Elliman is selling a brownstone at 237 West 131st Street for $895,000. Todd Stevens, the agent representing the seller, says its situation across from public housing might make it attractive to an investor for converting into studios.  Brokers say buyers willing to wait for deals on town houses might look in areas like Sunnyside in Queens and Mott Haven in the Bronx. Carmela Massimo, an associate broker with Welcome Home Real Estate, estimates that a town house comes on the market in Sunnyside about every six months. Buyers willing to take on renovation projects typically pay about $600,000 for one-family homes and $800,000 for two-family homes, she said.  The enclave of 100-year-old town homes in Mott Haven also offers properties costing about $600,000 to $750,000 when they come to market. Sasha Catus, president of Catus Properties, is listing a 107-year-old two-family town house at 304 Alexander Avenue for $749,000. He says that prices for these town houses have doubled in the last two to three years because of the steep increases in nearby Harlem. ''In Brooklyn and Harlem,'' Mr. Catus said, ''you have several thousand town houses, whereas in the South Bronx you have a fraction of that. The commodity itself is rare.''  ",

Telluride is home to one of the very first hydroelectric power plants, and this building used to belong to the Telluride Power Company. When you walk in the front door, there's a little slot. It says ''Bills.'' Our windows look out on the gondola station and mountains. Nothing will get built there.  We live in Las Vegas, but I'd been coming to Telluride for years. When our daughter was born, I began trying to convince Bree we could move here permanently and live happily ever after. That fell on deaf ears. But when my half-brother expressed interest in starting a business, and told us his daughter, Berkeley, was attending aesthetician school, Bree and I got to thinking about trying it out, since Berkeley could run the shop. Our salon is about 300 square feet and the rest of the commercial space is a real estate office.  Living in a commercial building can be funky. The bathroom, for example, has two doors, one that was designed as a public entrance for the community, and one that was for the office workers. You can have a bath in there during business hours, but you have to be very careful.  We didn't want to compromise the integrity of the building, so we didn't put in a kitchen. We have a microwave and a little fridge for necessities, but we mostly go out to eat. That's fine with us. The restaurants here are great, and Berkeley's husband runs two of the nearby gyro carts, so we're about 100 feet from the best sandwiches in town.

But after the installation of an automated signal system last May, the idling trains are now virtually in some residents' backyards.  Jack Eddington, a Suffolk County legislator whose district includes Patchogue, said a six-foot chain-link fence is all that separates the trains from the backyards of homeowners on Academy Street.  ''The trains are literally 10 feet from their homes,'' he said.  Ann M. Goodhue, who lives on the opposite side of Academy Street, said she found the ''train situation atrocious.'' She said vibrations from three trains that sat idling on the siding several years ago cracked her second-floor ceiling.  Mr. Eddington said he had been at the siding when two trains were idling and found the noise very loud. ''And they give off a diesel smell,'' he said.  Until several years ago, the siding was about a mile west in a commercial area. Mr. Eddington said complaints from residents were fewer because a lumberyard and a bowling alley were on either side of the tracks and homes were far from the idling trains. But about six years ago, he said, trains were instructed to idle about three-quarters of a mile to the east, ''and it became a general nuisance because it was almost right in the middle of town.''  When a new signal system was installed last May about 200 to 300 feet farther east to align with a switch for the tracks, train engineers were instructed to idle there, said Susan McGowan, a railroad spokeswoman.  Mr. Eddington said that change put the trains ''right along the backyards of 12 or 13 homes'' on Academy Street.  ''I want the railroad to do the right thing'' for the residents, he said. ''I have looked up and down the track, and I see areas that don't have homes. I'm not telling them where they should go, but what I am saying is that where they are now is not acceptable.''  Ms. McGowan said that in an effort to ''minimize the inconvenience,'' the railroad had relocated two of six weekday trains that use the siding. One was moved 10 to 20 feet to the north siding, and a second was moved to a siding in Speonk.  ''These are the first steps we have taken,'' she said. ''We're continuing to look at the situation.''

            "text": "  JOURNAL SQUARE -- which was once the centerpiece of vibrant downtown -- slouched into seediness after the mass defection of middle-class families to the suburbs more than a half-century ago.  It has been waiting ever since for a comeback, at least in the view of those who knew it when. And that group would certainly include Lowell Harwood, 77, who as a boy helped out at a busy parking lot on Journal Square, and jostled through crowds to get to the movies at one of three grand theaters there.  Now Mr. Harwood, the managing partner of his family's third-generation firm, Harwood Properties, is engineering the hoped-for comeback.  Last month, city officials unanimously approved Harwood Properties' plan to revitalize an entire city block that had fallen into decrepitude and gone on to fast-food heaven. (McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and a small Mexican restaurant occupy three prominent storefronts where a hotel, a bakery and an old-style cafeteria once thrived.)  Two residential skyscrapers would anchor the ''new'' block with more than 1,000 units, a retail center, five floors of parking, a rooftop fitness center -- and even a rooftop dog run.  ''We're going to bring it back,'' Mr. Harwood said. From his company's eighth-floor office in the building next to The Jersey Journal, the newspaper for which the square is named, he looked down at the 1.5-acre site across the street, Journal Square Plaza.  ''All the excitement,'' he added. ''The people on the streets. It will be a renaissance like in New York City neighborhoods, in Harlem and other places you would have never thought people would be dying to move into again.''  Right now, parts of the Journal Square plan are in flux -- especially the issue of whether to build two towers right away, or build one at a time, and the question of condominiums versus rentals.  ''We're leaning toward building the bigger tower first -- 545 feet and 51 stories,'' Mr. Harwood said. ''We're leaning toward more rentals than condos, given the market right now -- but we're just leaning, not decided, because the market changes all the time.''  Scott Harwood, Mr. Harwood's nephew, who is a partner in the company, said the final decision about condos or rentals might not come until the start of construction later this year. The company is working to persuade various current tenants in several buildings -- purchased in 2005 from a developer whose rehab plans had fizzled -- to relocate.  Besides the fast-food restaurants, there are a number of dollar stores and check-cashing joints. The Harwoods, though, are looking for more upscale shops for the two floors of retailing in their new complex. ''We would also like to get a grocery store in the building,'' the senior Mr. Harwood said.  They see the future Journal Square as an urban neighborhood, populated by young professionals, many commuting to Wall Street and Midtown.  The residential towers will consist mostly of one-bedroom units, with some studios and two-bedrooms, Lowell Harwood said.  Neither purchase prices nor rental rates have been determined yet, he said. But he added that he expected a typical one-bedroom to rent for roughly $2,000 a month.  Each unit will have a washer-dryer and hardwood floors. There will be ample parking in the building -- 674 spaces, to be built on floors above the retail level but below the residential towers. And most apartments will have far-reaching views taking in the Statue of Liberty, the Hudson River and some part of the Manhattan skyline, Mr. Harwell said.  The Harwood site is adjacent to the Journal Square Transportation Center, where commuter bus lines operate, and an adjoining PATH train station. The train ride is 12 minutes to the World Trade Center and 20 minutes to Penn Station.  The site also abuts the four-story Hudson Community College building on Sip Avenue.  Journal Square was once home to three highly ornate movie palaces -- the Loew's Theater, the Stanley Theater and the State Theater -- all within two or three blocks of the redevelopment site.  Four years ago, the State Theater was demolished and a new 12-story, 130-unit apartment building rose on the site -- the first new structure at Journal Square in more than 20 years. Harwood Properties was one of a group of local developers that were partners on the project.  ''The one-bedroom units there were snapped up, and today the building is fully leased,'' Mr. Harwood said, ''which is why we are going to put predominantly one-bedroom units in this development.''  The Journal Square redevelopment effort started almost a decade before the State Theater project, with the busy PATH station as the catalyst. In 1999, a pedestrian area was created to set the area off, featuring fountains, old-fashioned lampposts and a statue of Jackie Robinson, who made his debut as the first black player in professional baseball in a game at Jersey City's old Roosevelt Stadium in 1946.  The Harwood family business began in Manhattan, in the 1920s, when Lowell's grandparents, Wolfe and Sarah Harwood, bought a trolley car garage and transformed it into an automobile garage.  The business went on to acquire 35 New York City parking lots, then lost them all during the Depression.  In 1936 Lowell's mother, Laura, decided to rent a parking lot in Jersey City -- the one where Lowell worked as a boy -- and the Harwoods went on to become deeply entrenched in Jersey City real estate and development.  Today, Mr. Harwood runs his business with Scott and another nephew, Brett Harwood. He has built a number of large commercial and residential buildings in New York City, Boston and Philadelphia.  In addition to the Journal Square project, he and a partner are working on plans to build a mixed-use residential building at the southwest corner of 44th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.  ",

            "text": "  THIS former whaling port on Gardiner's Bay, now a cozy two-square-mile village of restored historic homes, has caught the fancy of condominium developers.  Three projects were proposed recently within two months, according to the mayor of this East End village, Gregory Ferraris. The biggest, which has generated the most interest, is a plan to restore and develop the former Bulova Watchcase Factory.  ''Most of Sag Harbor worked here at one time,'' Mr. Ferraris said of the 1880 Italianate brick factory on 2.5 acres. It employed more than 500 people at its peak, and over the years manufactured gold and silver jewelry and, in its last decades, watch casings, he said.  Bulova bought the building in 1936 and ended its operations there in 1981. But the site had been contaminated by heavy metals over its long history, the mayor said, and since Bulova's departure it has crumbled and decayed. Bricks still lay in a pile at the base of the four-story factory on a recent wind-blown morning.  Now the site, still on the New York State Superfund list, is nearly cleaned up, the mayor said.  Last January, Cape Advisors, a Manhattan development firm, bought the building for $16 million, according to David Kronman, a project developer for the company. The owners will present a proposal for a condominium development of 63 apartments and 18 town-house-style units, two per building, to the planning board on Jan. 23.  And that's just the start of the approval process. Officials are fiercely protective of the village's eclectic mix of architecture, which ranges from 1700's Federalist two-stories to 19th-century clapboard fishermen's cottages, and its views both from land and from boats on the water. Sag Harbor has five review boards that must approve any development project.  Cape Advisors hopes that the reputation of its architecture firm, Beyer Blinder Belle, will help to win the village over. That firm, the lead architect on the main interior renovation of Grand Central Terminal in 1998, worked on the restoration of Ellis Island together with the Boston firm Notter, Feingold Alexander, according to Michael Wetstone, an associate partner at Beyer Blinder Belle.  In aerial views, the Bulova building, with jutting 24-foot-wide brick extensions added at different times over the years, is shaped like an ancient hieroglyph etched on a roughly triangular lot that borders four streets.  Nearly all of the future condominiums would have two walls of 7-foot-high windows, exposed brick and heavy timbers, Mr. Wetstone said. ''You'll get a really open, airy sense of space'' in the lofts, with floods of natural light and 12-foot ceilings.  The units will range in size from 600-square-foot studios to a 2,700-square-foot four-bedroom town house duplex, Mr. Kronman said.  The nine town houses, which will replace the parking lot, will also have a courtyard and a glass-enclosed swimming pool.  Penthouse units in the restored factory building will have walled-off areas of the roof, which will have plantings and soil up to a foot deep, Mr. Wetstone said.  The buildings will also have energy-saving heating and cooling systems, he said, citing solar panels, underground geothermal cooling pipes and small turbines that capture heat created from generating electricity.  The other two proposed condominium projects are next to the highly coveted waterfront.  On Ferry Road, at the base of the bridge that connects Sag Harbor to North Haven, the developer Michael Maidan is planning 22 condominiums, each with its own boat slip. Mr. Maidan's firm Code Red is also planning a second 20-unit condominium nearby at 21 West Water Street, the site of a former nightclub.  Like residents near the Bulova factory, which has been an eyesore for nearly 25 years, neighbors of the nightclub are welcoming change on that site, according to the mayor. The Water Street proposal, and the new boardwalk that the developer is planning, will also reduce the amount of concrete and add landscaping.  To help keep developers' designs from overtaxing village infrastructure like the sewage treatment plant, the village planning consultant, Richard Warren of Inter-Science Research Associates, has been attending all planning meetings since July at the request of the mayor, he said.  ''You have three very large projects for sleepy little Sag Harbor,'' Mr. Warren said, ''and we want to get them right.''  Whatever the final designs, local real estate brokers are confident that the units will command top prices.  Robert Evjen, a broker in Prudential Douglas Elliman's Sag Harbor office, said he had a list of 30 interested prospective buyers for the three projects.  Since the projects are all within walking distance of Main Street and downtown Sag Harbor, Mr. Evjen said, the prices for most of the units are likely to exceed $1 million.  A three-year waiting list for slips at the dock may also propel demand for Mr. Maidan's project at Ferry Road, he added. ''We've already had people looking to purchase those units just for the boat slips alone, even before any prices have been set,'' Mr. Evjen said.  The loft-style condos at the Bulova building will be unique to the village and, more broadly, to the East End, he said. ''There's nothing else like it,'' he added, citing the great views of Gardiner's Bay and the dock.  Potential buyers, Mr. Evjen said, are other East End homeowners who want to downsize, and foreign and local investors.  Wealthy boaters will also welcome new condos close to the dock of this little village, he said. ''Sometimes, people like to plunk down some money on a pied-\u00e0-terre and have a place to stay away from their yacht.''  In the Region | Long Island  ",

            "text": "  The only thing stretching across the entrance to the Bay Front Estates at Mill Basin last week, over a mud-and-gravel road split by a trench for the new water and sewer pipes, was a string of multicolored flags, sagging from a pair of long two-by-fours driven into the raw ground.  But while the development, in southeastern Brooklyn, is still unfinished and the lavish single-family houses inside have only begun to sell, there is a sign that something unusual is afoot. On either side of the entrance, a few feet from each of the ersatz flagpoles, are little guard huts. Once the road is done, the people in the huts will control access to that rarest of New York development phenomena: a gated community.  ''Just about everyone in Florida lives in one now, and Las Vegas, but they are kind of rare in our area,'' said the development's exclusive broker, Tony vanderBeek of Coldwell Banker Mid Plaza Real Estate.  True, New York City has a small number of long-established gated communities, like Sea Gate in Brooklyn and Breezy Point in Queens. But the Bay Front Estates is new, and at least one more is on the way, in Brooklyn's Bergen Beach. That fenced-off complex is called Mill Harbor Condominiums, and according to its Web site, it will offer its residents ''suburban lifestyle close to Manhattan.''  Surprisingly enough, a suburban way of life is just what many people are after, said Dorothy Turano, district manager of Community Board 18, which includes Bergen Beach and Mill Basin.  On the Bay Front Estates site, the board pushed for low-density housing during a tortuous, decade-long rezoning process that saw the rise and fall of multiple development proposals for the land, a fallow stretch across the water from Kings Plaza Mall. In the end, Ms. Turano said, the board was thrilled with the plan by the Queens-based developer H & H Builders for a gated, strictly residential community.  ''We don't have mixed uses here, and we don't want them,'' she said. ''We don't think you should mix commercial and residential. It doesn't work, not in Brooklyn. The boroughs, they're more suburban and we want to keep it suburban.''  State Senator Carl Kruger, who represents the neighborhood, said he was impressed by Bay Front Estates, with its meandering road and decorative streetlights, and the flexibility it will give a future homeowners' association to determine its own level of security.  ''It's exactly what we'd like to be able to replicate on undeveloped parcels throughout the community,'' he said.  In the section of Mill Basin near the site, the houses are similar to, if smaller than, the ones inside where the gate will be. The neighboring houses are brick on the first floor, with white siding or shingles above. The homes at Bay Front Estates have stucco. The neighboring homes are detached from one another, with yards, driveways and even garages.  The streets were largely quiet on a recent afternoon, but comments by the few residents who were out suggested that the new estates were no big deal.  ''I don't think anything is really a big deal around here,'' 23-year-old Daniel Bykhovsky, who was walking to the bus, said wryly.  So far, Mr. vanderBeek said, four of the new houses have been sold. Twenty others have been built, and 10 lots on the water are set aside for custom houses. The asking prices for the existing houses begin at $1.35 million.  The gate that will be installed at the entrance, he said, is less about safety than about creating a sense of distinctness for the homes within: five-bedroom houses with marble bathrooms. They are, Mr. vanderBeek said, ''the nicest houses in the area.''  Construction at the Mill Harbor Condominiums is scheduled to continue until the end of the year, but new owners are to begin moving in next month. Sean Lavin, one of the partners in Parkmore Development, which is building the complex, said the gate would distinguish the walkable, garden-style units from the detached one- and two-family homes nearby.  ''It's not so much that you're preventing people from getting in there,'' Mr. Lavin said. ''I think people liked the idea of added security. They didn't feel the necessity to have it, but it's similar to being in a doorman building, where it adds a sense of exclusivity.''

            "text": "  SOMETIMES, developers and architects say, the biggest design problem with a new Manhattan residential building is figuring out how it will fit onto its lot. Two luxury condominiums, one planned for East 51st Street and the other for East 13th, are currently presenting a challenge.  The 21-story condo that will rise at 211 East 51st Street, between Second and Third Avenues, is set to contain 72 units, ranging from studios to three-bedrooms. Pricing hasn't been set yet, because the building is under contract. Uned Associates, the current owner, based in Manhattan, is selling to Allied Properties of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The closing is scheduled for this week, said Tim Ziss, Allied's principal.  At first, Mr. Ziss had planned to demolish the 15-story condo currently on the site, leaving only its metal beams, concrete floors and foundation, and use those elements as the groundwork for something larger, thereby creating the maximum number of apartments permitted at the site.  But this plan was hamstrung by the fact that the property straddles a commercial zone and a residential zone, each with different building height requirements.  A potentially lopsided roofline wasn't what worried Mr. Ziss. It was the fact that height caps on the residential eastern half of the building would severely curtail how many units he could create.  ''It was extremely complicated,'' he said. ''Even the zoning experts had a hard time tweaking this one.''  The solution, proposed by the architect David Mandl, was to add medical offices to the building's second and third floors. By law, if commercial tenants serve some kind of public benefit, as doctors do, the building can grow taller -- in this case, on the commercial side. Thus, more square footage can be wrung from the project.  ''I've been practicing under my own shingle since 1980, and this is one of the more exotic zoning situations I've dealt with,'' Mr. Mandl said. ''But I think it will turn out to be an elegant project.''  For the A Building, a luxury condo at 425 East 13th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A, the hitch came in the form of an unusual T-shaped lot that extends the width of a block -- so that the T's base fronts on 14th Street.  The size may seem advantageous, leaving plenty of room for extra apartments. But according to John Cetra, the architect, zoning dictates that any new structures be massed along the lot's edges, so that an unbroken line of buildings faces the sidewalk.  So the building is divided in two. The East 13th Street portion, with 150 feet of frontage, will have 77 units, and the East 14th Street side, with 25 feet of frontage, will have 7 units. Prices range from $600,000 to $2.5 million, and 35 percent of the units have sold, said Robert Kaliner, president of the Ascend Group, a Manhattan-based developer.  To avoid leaving a potentially unattractive doughnut hole of unused space in the lot's center, Mr. Cetra decided to pack it with trees and grasses, creating a courtyard that complements the 5,000-square-foot roof deck, which will have similar landscaping and a 50-foot pool.  Another snag: East 13th Street sits at a slightly lower elevation than East 14th, which means that the glass walkway traversing the courtyard to connect the building's two areas must slope down, Mr. Cetra said.  ''Organizing the lower floors was sort of a puzzle,'' he added, explaining that he had never worked on a lot like this before, or on a block-through project. ''It added a lot of drama.''

            "text": "  About 5,000 parking spaces will be added at Metro-North train stations over the next few years, the State Department of Transportation said last week.  The department said 3,000 spaces would be for two new stations, one planned for the border of Orange and West Haven, which would get 2,000 spaces, and the other, a second station in Fairfield, near the Bridgeport line, which would get 1,000.  A new surface lot and two new decks to be built on the existing garage in Bridgeport would add 500 spaces; a planned multideck garage in Stratford would add 435; and another 100 would be on a deck to be built over the present lot in Wilton, the department said. As many as 1,000 spaces could also be added in New Haven.  Eugene J. Colonese, the department's rail administrator, said that the earliest that work on the new garages could begin would be this year in Bridgeport.  State Senator John McKinney, Republican of Fairfield, a member of the Legislature's transportation committee, said that 5,000 spaces would not be enough. He said other lots at stations between Stamford and Fairfield were also overcrowded.  In Westport, for example, the police said 930 people were waiting for about 1,500 reserved spaces at its Saugatuck and Greens Farms stations. They said the wait was about four years for a town resident and about six years for nonresidents.  Mr. McKinney said towns should develop plans for more parking and the state should make money available to help. ''We have $600 million committed to buying new rail cars to increase ridership on Metro-North, but we're not going to be able to do that if people can't park at the train station,'' he said.  Mr. Colonese said the transportation department was always looking for ways to add parking. ''We realize it is a constraint on ridership,'' he said.  JEFF HOLTZ  THE WEEK  ",

            "text": "  DOUGLAS PINTER, a San Francisco real estate developer and the former chief executive of a long-forgotten Internet start-up, is used to the ups and downs of the business world, but his introduction to the pitfalls of New York City real estate has been a bit abrupt.  Just last month, Mr. Pinter closed on his $2.4 million 10th-floor apartment in a notable new condominium, the Urban Glass House, the last residential commission of Philip Johnson, modeled loosely on the architect's own home in Connecticut and marketed as a ''modernist luxury residence.''  Mr. Pinter liked the building's light and airy look, even though its location, at Spring and Washington Streets, was in a grungy no-name land between Greenwich Village, TriBeCa and SoHo. It is across the street from ventilation shafts for the Holland Tunnel. Still, some upper-floor apartments have views to the south, and most of the apartments have views of the river to the north and west. At least for now.  But in the last month, with most of the 40 apartments in the building sold or in contract, the New York City Sanitation Department said that it planned to take over a large parking lot just to the north and diagonally opposite the Urban Glass House. It would put up a garage as tall as a 15-story building and longer than a football field that promises to block much of the view of the river from many apartments.  Having a view blocked by a newer, bigger building is an old story in New York. But seldom has the view from such a distinctive building been threatened so soon after the ink on so many sales contracts has dried. The building opened in October.  Since then, Mr. Pinter and his neighbors, an affluent mix of models, minor celebrities and Wall Street executives who spent $2 million or more for their apartments, have been gathering information and organizing.  Mr. Pinter, who calls himself semiretired, said he was looking for ''like-minded residents'' to join him at a hearing called by the Sanitation Department to discuss plans for the new garage.  ''It's a shame,'' Mr. Pinter said. ''Invariably something would have been built there, but here is a building that was critically acclaimed architecturally, modest in size and scale and not gaudy, facing a consolidated sanitation garage.''  The Sanitation Department plan was put forth in a 46-page document posted on the department's Web site. The document was dated Dec. 28 but was first spotted in early January by residents of the neighborhood. The plans call for putting up a garage 140 to 150 feet high on the lot, which is bounded by Spring, Washington and West Streets and to the north by a large office and warehouse building. The Urban Glass House tops out at 137 feet.  The garage's ground floor would be used by the United Parcel Service, which now parks its trucks on the lot, while the rest of the building would be used by the Sanitation Department, consolidating three garages. A smaller garage just to the south of the parking lot and next to the ventilation shafts would be turned into a truck wash and refueling depot, storing 13,000 gallons of fuel and oil.  Vito Turso, a deputy sanitation commissioner, said that the garage was needed to replace garages along the river in the newly established Hudson River Park. ''We are trying to be as understanding and as good a neighbor as we can to that community,'' Mr. Turso said, ''recognizing that we still need to provide refuse collection, recycling and snow removal to that part of town.''  Abe Shnay, a partner in the group that developed the Urban Glass House, said that buyers were still signing contracts and that most were aware that the parking lot could someday be developed. At one point, he said, there were rumors that a high-rise would go up on the site. ''The reality is that on the upper floors the best views are to the south, incredible views of the upper harbor and the Statue of Liberty,'' he said.  But Michael Shvo, the president of Shvo Marketing, a real estate company that is not involved with the Urban Glass House, said he always tells buyers, ''There are only two views in New York that are guaranteed: if you are on a park, or if you are facing a brick wall.''  Search Results: Condo in the Raw  CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING, the director of engineering at Google's rapidly expanding New York office, knows how to find needles in what he calls a ''20 terabyte haystack.''  Mr. Nevill-Manning, who invented Google's Froogle shopping service, has now also threaded the real estate needle and landed one of downtown's most unusual and, for a while, hardest-to-sell properties: the rooftop English castle topped by a live-in copper dome at 150 Nassau Street, an ornate turn-of-the-last-century building that was once New York's tallest skyscraper.  Mr. Nevill-Manning and his wife, Kristin, who also works at Google's New York office, have just closed on one of the most expensive condominiums in the financial district, paying $6.45 million for the penthouse, which has 6,400 square feet of space spread over three floors atop a Romanesque and Renaissance Revival building, according to brokers briefed on the transaction.  The apartment has a 30-by-30-foot outdoor deck, a private terrace that winds around the steep copper-clad roof, huge semicircular windows, 18-foot ceilings and a 360-degree view -- at least until the developer Forest City builds a 75-story skyscraper on the site of a parking lot for New York Downtown Hospital nearby. It has one major drawback, however: the space has no plumbing or electricity or interior walls, and it needs work estimated to cost $2 million or more, depending on the detail, before anyone can move in.  But if you want to know one version of what it might look like, you might look at the Spike Lee film ''Inside Man,'' released last year and starring Denzel Washington. The space was dressed up and appeared as the office of Jodie Foster's character, a mysterious power broker.  The apartment was the last unsold unit in the 23-story building, a city landmark, built in 1895 as the American Tract Society Building. It happened to go on the market just days before the attack on the World Trade Center in September 2001.  Over the last few years, the apartment was offered through some of the largest brokerages in the city, Prudential Douglas Elliman and Brown Harris Stevens. It was finally sold by Adam Modlin and Reuben Davis of the Modlin Group, a small firm. Along the way, the asking price went from $12 million, including a $2 million credit toward the cost of the interior, to $6.9 million.  Estimating Celebrity Value  HOW much is celebrity really worth? Only two years after the actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her husband, Chris Martin, the British rocker, paid $7.95 million for a 7,000-square-foot condominium in TriBeCa, they have put it back on the market for an even $14 million.  The apartment on Harrison Street has 1,600 square feet of gardens and outdoor space, including a rooftop soaking pool, an elevator, a steam shower, six bedrooms and four and half baths. It also has a finished basement with two washers and two dryers.  The listing broker, Carter Wilcox of the Corcoran Group, did not return telephone calls. But Stephen Huvane, Ms. Paltrow's publicist, said ''considerable'' work had been done on the unit. ''I really doubt there is such a thing as 'celebrity' value at that price range,'' he said. ''But I am not a real estate professional.''  BIG DEAL E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com  ",

The mother, Valerie Bell, said she would continue the vigil for 50 days, the number of bullets fired in the Nov. 25 shooting, or until indictments were filed in the case. Mr. Bell and a group of friends were in a car after his bachelor party when the shooting occurred. Two of Mr. Bell's friends were wounded in the shooting. The officers have said that they thought one of the men in the car had a gun. The five police officers involved have been on desk duty since the shooting. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, is investigating.  DARYL KHAN  ",

It was not immediately clear what role Mr. Gonzalez might have played in the crimes that the police say linked him to the two other suspects, Belter Yovanni Gubara Rivera and Marcos Polanco, both 17.  But a law enforcement official said that on Nov. 20, he attacked a 20-year-old man delivering food on a bicycle. The man was punched and kicked, and the robber stole $200 and his cellphone, the official said, adding that Mr. Gonzalez had confessed.  The police said Mr. Rivera and Mr. Polanco both confessed to attacking and robbing several people in the park between Nov. 22 and Dec. 25. They were being held without bail. One victim, Jae Woo Park, 36, of Little Neck, was severely beaten on Dec. 25 and was still unconscious.  Mr. Rivera was also charged with murder in the death of Carlos Flores, 40, whose lacerated body was found in one of the park's ponds on Dec. 5.  ",

It was unclear how the dispute, which apparently began with a honked horn, escalated to gunfire.  The shooting took place shortly after 7 p.m. when the officer, identified by the State Department of Correctional Services as Emilio Maldonado, 29, stopped his car behind a sport utility vehicle at a stoplight at Ditmars Avenue and 94th Street, investigators said. After the light turned green, Mr. Maldonado apparently honked his horn.  The police said two men who were in the sport utility vehicle got out and approached Mr. Maldonado's car, where he was sitting with his wife and child, the police said. The two men and Mr. Maldonado got into a dispute, perhaps involving a struggle for the officer's gun, investigators said. Mr. Maldonado fired one shot, hitting one of the men in the chest.  The person who was shot, identified only as a 36-year-old man, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he later died, the police said. The other man, also not identified, fled the scene, according to the police, who said he was later caught and taken to the 115th Precinct station house for questioning. The correction officer was also being questioned by the police last night.  Mr. Maldonado works at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, the state's only maximum security prison for women, according to Linda Foglia, a spokeswoman for the Department of Correctional Services. She said that Mr. Maldonado's personal weapon was registered with the department.  ''They are able to carry their guns when they are off-duty,'' Ms. Foglia said. ''They are peace officers. They have the ability to make arrests.''  She added: ''They are required to register their weapon with our agency and he did so. So on our end, he is following the appropriate procedures.''  ",

            "text": "  Three suspects accused of attacking an off-duty police officer, gravely injuring him, were ordered held without bail yesterday.  The suspects -- Lamont Lafoucade, 33, and Darvell Williams, 21, both from Brooklyn, and Thelma Lopez, 28, of the Bronx -- were arraigned on charges of gang assault. Mr. Lafoucade was also charged with driving while intoxicated. He is on parole after serving nine years in prison for attempted murder, law enforcement officials said.  Mr. Williams was convicted of third-degree assault last year, but it was unclear last night if he served time in prison, the police said. Ms. Lopez was arrested in December for assault on an officer and released, the officials said. She is awaiting a hearing on the charge next month.  One of the officers, Richard Lomax, 29, suffered a skull fracture and bleeding on the brain. He was in critical but stable condition last night at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, the police said. The second officer, Robert DiFazio, 21, was released from St. Vincent's hospital on Saturday.  The police said Officer Lomax was driving his Ford Explorer when he crashed into a Nissan Maxima about 4 a.m. on Saturday on 10th Avenue near 28th Street in Chelsea, because of icy road conditions. The police said the officers got out of their car to talk with the occupants of the Nissan and were attacked.  Raymond L. Loving, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who represents Mr. Williams, disputed the police account and suggested the assault might not have been unprovoked. He also questioned whether one of the officers had been drinking.  The police said yesterday that the officers were not tested for alcohol in their blood because there was no reason to suspect that drinking contributed to the accident.  ",

The man, Leroi Kenner, 45, and his brother, Chris Kenner, 36, both of Queens, attacked the officer, Emilio Maldonado, 29, after he honked at them near La Guardia Airport when they failed to accelerate after their traffic light turned green, the police said. According to a witness, the police said, the men punched the officer in the face through an open car window. Then, realizing that he was an officer, they shouted, ''Shoot the cop, shoot the cop.'' According to the witness, the police said, one of the brothers reached for his waistband as if to retrieve a gun, and the officer shot once, striking Chris Kenner in the torso. He was taken to a Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he died. The investigation is continuing, but Officer Maldonado has not been charged. A spokeswoman for the Department of Correctional Services, Linda Foglia, said Officer Maldonado's use of his weapon appeared to be proper procedure.  EMILY VASQUEZ  ",

            "text": "  Two off-duty police officers were injured, one of them critically, when three people attacked them early yesterday after a car accident on the West Side of Manhattan, the police said.  The officers were driving north on 10th Avenue near West 28th Street in Chelsea shortly before 4 a.m. when their Ford Explorer slid on ice and rear-ended a Nissan Maxima, the police said.  The officer who had been driving the Explorer got out and called 911, the police said, but by then the Nissan's three occupants had gotten out and begun attacking him and his passenger, who had also stepped out of the Explorer.  Officers from the 10th Precinct who were on patrol saw the attack and arrested the three people who had been in the Nissan, the police said. They were identified as Lamont Lafoucade, 33, and Durvell Williams, 21, both of Brooklyn, and Thelma Lopez, 28, of the Bronx.  All three were charged with assault and with criminal possession of a weapon after a switchblade was found in the Nissan, the police said. Mr. Lafoucade was also charged with driving while intoxicated, the police said.  Both officers were taken to St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan. The one who was driving, Richard Lomax, 29, who works in the Bronx, suffered severe head trauma with a fractured skull, and was in critical condition, the police said.  His passenger, who is 21 and works in Brooklyn, was in stable condition; he was not identified by the Police Department yesterday. Both joined the force in July, the police said.  At least two of the suspects have criminal histories. Mr. Lafoucade, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant and appears to also go by the name Lamont Williams, served nearly 10 years in prison for armed robbery, and was let out on conditional release last March, according to state corrections records. He was also arrested late last month in Suffolk County on a charge of possessing about $20,000 worth of unstamped cigarettes, state court records show.  The police said Mr. Williams, of East New York, had previously been arrested for attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon. No one answered the door at either man's apartment yesterday.  Ms. Lopez pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in October, records show.  ",

Rosenbaum, near Mr. Rosenbaum's Washington home a year ago. At the trial of his cousin Percey Jordan Jr., Mr. Hamlin, 24, testified that he had stolen Mr. Rosenbaum's wallet but that it was Mr. Jordan, wielding a pipe, who had delivered a fatal blow to the victim's head. Mr. Rosenbaum, 63, died two days later. Mr. Jordan is to be sentenced before the same judge, Erik P. Christian of District of Columbia Superior Court, later this month. Convicted of first-degree murder, he faces at least 30 years in prison and a maximum of life without the possibility of parole.  SARAH ABRUZZESE  ",

The man, Raseed Watson, 21, of Paterson, N.J., was extradited to Nassau County on Tuesday and arraigned yesterday on one count of first-degree robbery, the police said. The police said they believed that Mr. Watson fired the shot that injured the boy, John Henry Romano Jr., now 10, and expected to file additional charges against him. Investigators said Mr. Watson was one of three men who entered the Inwood home in September and engaged in a gunfight with the owner. A 22-year-old Brooklyn man was arrested in the case in October, and a third suspect remains at large, the police said.  NICOLE COTRONEO  ",

            "text": "  A man accused of fatally shooting the owner of a beauty salon here had been hired by a companion she was trying to break up with, the police said on Tuesday.  The companion, Patrick Bowie, 45, of Middletown, tried to kill himself before he was arrested, the police said.  Mr. Bowie and the man accused of pulling the trigger, Melvin Green, 35, of the Bronx, were charged in the murder of Fermina Nunez, 36, who was shot in the back of the head late Saturday at the salon, said Lt. Paul Rickard of the Middletown Police Department.  Mr. Bowie, who had had an off-and-on relationship for seven years with Ms. Nunez, a mother of four, hired Mr. Green to go to the salon, on Wickham Avenue, and kill her, Lieutenant Rickard said. He would not say how much money was involved.  ''There was no other factor involved other than she was trying to get out of a relationship,'' Mr. Rickard said.  As detectives waited for a search warrant outside Mr. Bowie's house on Tuesday morning, he stabbed himself in the neck and groin and slit a wrist with a kitchen knife, the police said. He then walked outside and surrendered.  He was taken to Orange Regional Medical Center in Middletown, where he was arraigned on a charge of first-degree murder, Lieutenant Rickard said. He was then taken to the Westchester County Medical Center, where he was listed in serious condition.  Mr. Green, who the police said had been a friend of Mr. Bowie's for 20 years, was taken into custody in the Bronx on Monday night and brought to Middletown for questioning. While he was being driven to Orange County, Middletown detectives, along with the New York State and New York City police, searched his apartment and found a gun, Lieutenant Rickard said. Mr. Green was charged with first-degree murder and robbery and was being held at the Orange County Jail without bail, the authorities said.  According to the police, Mr. Green entered the Final Touch by Fermina beauty salon just before midnight on Saturday as Ms. Nunez was doing the hair of three customers who were getting ready for New Year's. He forced the women to lie face down and demanded that Ms. Nunez tell him how to open the cash register. When he could not do it himself, Ms. Nunez opened the register for him. He then shot her in the head, taking money from the register before he fled, Lieutenant Rickard said.  Detectives think Mr. Bowie was outside the shop at the time of the killing, Lt. Patrick Freeman of the Middletown police said.  The police said they began investigating Mr. Bowie because of his relationship with Ms. Nunez. There were several occasions in which the police were called to their homes, though no arrests were made, Lieutenant Rickard said. The inquiry led to Mr. Green, who matched the description of the gunman given by a witness, the police said.  Though the gunman demanded money, Lieutenant Rickard said, detectives suspected that robbery was not the motive because there were gas stations in the area that would have had more cash and because the killer seemed to know that Ms. Nunez was working late.  ''We knew right off the bat the robbery was unusual and something else was going on,'' he added.  Both Mr. Bowie and Mr. Green have criminal records. Mr. Bowie was convicted of grand larceny in New York City in 1995. Mr. Green served three years in a New York State prison in the mid-1990s on a weapons conviction. He was also convicted of robbery and possession of a loaded firearm in New York in 1991, said Sgt. Jerry Mishk, a detective in the Middletown Police Department.  Outside Ms. Nunez's salon, a woman who identified herself as a relative of Ms. Nunez's said that Ms. Nunez had spoken of being stalked by Mr. Bowie.  ",

Mr. Brown said the group was riding in a Ford Explorer with the victim, Anthony Albaricci, 24, when one man looped a belt around Mr. Albaricci's neck and began strangling him. Another stabbed Mr. Albaricci, while one slashed him with a razor. Aamer Khan, who was driving, turned and tried to shoot him with a pistol, Mr. Brown said. The Explorer crashed and Mr. Albaricci fled, only to be chased and beaten with a wooden chair by two of the teenagers, Mr. Brown said, while the other two ran him down with the Explorer.  ",

The man, a paroled sex offender, is now suspected of abducting and raping a 17-year-old girl just two hours after the complaint, the police said.  The officers, who have not been identified by the police, are assigned to the 101st Precinct in Queens, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.  The suspect, Eric McCoy, was arrested on Jan. 3 and has been charged with committing two rapes in Queens in a little more than four weeks. In each case, he posed as a police officer and raped his victims inside motel rooms, the police said.  In the first assault, which occurred on Dec. 4, Mr. McCoy abducted a woman, 27, as she was getting off a bus in Jamaica and forced her to a motel, the police said. In the second episode, the authorities said, Mr. McCoy approached a 17-year-old girl on Jan. 2 in Kew Gardens and identified himself as a ''police special investigator.'' He said he had a gun and took her to a motel where he raped her, the police said.  Hours before the second rape, Mr. McCoy had told a 15-year-old girl that he was a police officer investigating an assault. After showing her a fake badge, he told her to wait inside a laundry. Inside, she talked about the encounter with a woman, who called 911, the police said.  Once the police arrived, Mr. McCoy approached the squad car and told the officers that two girls had been in a fight. When the girl came to the car, they asked whether she had been fighting. They told her to get into the car, drove her to a subway station and told her to go to school, the authorities said.  The officers failed to check whether Mr. McCoy had a criminal record and, apparently, to question others at the scene, the police said. Mr. McCoy was arrested after one victim remembered that he had identified himself as ''Investigator McCoy.''  ",

            "text": "  Manuel A. Morey kept his drugs in a lockbox under his bed, his friend said. When his three young boys were asleep, the people he sold cocaine to could use drugs in any room of his two-story house on Route 82. When the boys were awake, his customers had to go to the bedroom and close the door, or head to the basement.  The friend, Frankie Cannon, 18, lived with the Morey family for the past four or five months and helped Mr. Morey sell drugs. In an interview on Sunday in the Dutchess County Jail in Poughkeepsie, he described how Mr. Morey ran his business.  Mr. Cannon said that two of Mr. Morey's clients who are now charged in his death were friends who lived nearby: Charles W. Gilleo Jr., 31, and Mark S. Serrano, 29. Mr. Morey sold about $80 worth of powdered cocaine to Mr. Gilleo every week, and between $200 and $400 to Mr. Serrano, Mr. Cannon said.  It seemed to be a lucrative operation. Late last May, Mr. Morey, known as Tony, threw a birthday party for himself and his wife that cost $15,000. The party -- fueled by four ounces of cocaine, marijuana and plenty of beer -- lasted for four days, Mr. Cannon said.  But Mr. Morey's low-level drug-dealing apparently played a role in his death, and the deaths of his wife and three boys. On Jan. 19, Mr. Morey and his family were murdered, the authorities said, and their house was set on fire to cover up the crime, one of the most vicious killings in Dutchess County history.  Mr. Cannon was arrested a few days before the fire on a felony burglary charge, New York State Police officials said, and he has been at the county jail since Jan. 16. He said he has known Mr. Morey all his life, and that his mother and Mr. Morey went to high school together.  He spoke on Sunday while wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, seated in a visitor's room, his brown hair disheveled. ''If I was in that house, I'd be dead right now,'' Mr. Cannon said. ''I'd be dead for sure.''  Mr. Gilleo and Mr. Serrano have been arrested in connection with the killings, state police officials said. The authorities would not discuss the motive or the circumstances leading up to the murders, but said previously that Mr. Gilleo and Mr. Serrano and Mr. Morey had a business relationship involving drugs.  Mr. Serrano did not have a criminal record, and Mr. Gilleo had been arrested a few times for minor offenses, the authorities said. Mr. Morey has been described by state police as a low-level cocaine dealer who had an arrest record for minor offenses, none of them drug-related.  Mr. Cannon said the police had interviewed him as part of their investigation, but the authorities would not discuss the case this weekend.  ''Due to the nature of the investigation, in that it is still pending and pre-grand jury, I cannot comment,'' William V. Grady, the Dutchess County district attorney, said in reference to Mr. Cannon's comments.  Relatives of the Morey family and relatives of Mr. Gilleo and Mr. Serrano all declined to comment.  Mr. Morey and Mr. Gilleo were best friends, Mr. Cannon and neighbors of Mr. Gilleo said. They had grown up together and attended John Jay Senior High School in Hopewell Junction. They called each other brother, and Mr. Morey's sons called Mr. Gilleo Uncle Charlie. Mr. Serrano also went to John Jay, but Mr. Cannon said Mr. Serrano was closer to Mr. Gilleo than he was to Mr. Morey.  Mr. Cannon said that he dropped out of John Jay and had been kicked out of his grandmother's house. He was arrested for burglarizing John Jay. He admitted that he robbed for the thrill of it, and said that he and Mr. Morey would often go on ''benders,'' staying up for days high on cocaine.  Mr. Morey had a small circle of friends whom he would allow to come over to his house to buy drugs, Mr. Cannon said. Mr. Morey and Mr. Cannon would drive to the house of buyers Mr. Morey did not know as well. And, Mr. Cannon said, Mr. Morey made a point of keeping his doors and windows locked, sometimes propping chairs against doors.  The authorities said that Mr. Morey, 33, and his wife, Tina, 30, were fatally shot. The youngest child, Ryan, 6, died of blunt trauma to the head. The other children, Manuel, 13, and Adam, 10, died of multiple stab wounds.  Mr. Serrano and Mr. Gilleo were charged only with the murder of Mr. Morey. More charges are possible after the evidence goes before a county grand jury this week, officials said. The two men are being held without bail at the county jail.  Mr. Cannon said that Mrs. Morey came to his court appearance on Jan. 18, the day before the fire. ''She said, 'Don't worry, Frankie, I'm going to get you out of here,' '' he said.  ",

            "text": "  A white hunter has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of a Hmong immigrant from Laos who was hunting squirrels in a wildlife refuge in northern Wisconsin on Jan. 5. The hunter, James A. Nichols, 28, says he encountered the immigrant, Cha Vang, in the woods while hunting and shot him in self-defense after a confrontation. Mr. Vang's body was discovered a day later hidden beneath leaves and wood, and autopsy results showed he died from multiple stab and gunshot wounds. The criminal complaint states that Mr. Nichols told the police that the ''Hmong group are bad'' and that the Hmong ''are mean and kill everything'' and ''go for anything that moves.'' Many in the Hmong community have said they wonder if the killing was in retaliation for a 2004 episode in which a Hmong hunter shot and killed six white hunters in north-central Wisconsin after they accused him of trespassing.

            "text": "  After an intense 10-day manhunt, the Paterson police arrested an Irvington man on Tuesday morning and charged him with fatally shooting an off-duty rookie police officer here.  The Paterson police received more than 150 tips -- many based on a suspect sketch released last week -- about the Jan. 7 killing of Officer Tyron D. Franklin, 23. After a tip over the past weekend, the police arrested Teddy Charlemagne, 23, as he left a friend's apartment in Irvington about 8 a.m., a Paterson police spokesman, Lt. Anthony Traina, said on Tuesday.  Mr. Charlemagne, who was on parole after having been convicted of four narcotics and weapons felonies, was held on Tuesday on first-degree murder and weapons charges, said the Passaic County prosecutor, James F. Avigliano. He said his office would seek the death penalty for Mr. Charlemagne.  Officer Franklin, 23, was in the Broadway Fried Chicken restaurant on Broadway near Madison Avenue, in Paterson, ordering food about 1 a.m. on Jan. 7 when a man entered and demanded money, the authorities said. After a brief scuffle, the man shot Officer Franklin, who was not armed, and fled in a light-colored minivan, according to the police and witnesses.  ''The motive was robbery,'' Lieutenant Traina said. ''It was a botched robbery that led to his demise.''  Twice the police said they believed that they had captured Officer Franklin's killer, once after a car chase in East Orange, and again on Friday after surrounding an apartment building in Jersey City. Both times proved to be cases of mistaken identity, Lieutenant Traina said.  The person who called in the tip to the police that led to the arrest could receive a $60,000 reward if Mr. Charlemagne is convicted. Mr. Charlemagne is being held at the Passaic County jail in $2 million bail and is to be arraigned on Thursday morning.  The Paterson police chief, James Wittig, said that many officers had volunteered their time in the search for Officer Franklin's killer and that there was a sense of some closure when the suspect ''was apprehended and will be brought to justice.''  Officer Franklin, the father of a 16-month-old boy, Tyron Jr., was buried on Saturday and was remembered as a dedicated officer who came from a family steeped in public service. His father, Larry Franklin, is a retired captain with the Paterson Fire Department.  Standing near a shrine in front of the police administration building on Tuesday, the Rev. Michael Burton, a spokesman for the family, said relatives were still coming to grips with Officer Franklin's death.  Mr. Burton said relatives were somewhat relieved by the arrest. ''What this does is to help to deal with the situation, but it doesn't take the pain away,'' he said.  ",

            "text": "  A man who was killed last week in his home here, along with his wife and three young sons, was a low-level crack cocaine dealer and user, state police officials said Wednesday.  Firefighters discovered the bodies of the family of five early Friday morning as they fought an intense blaze that gutted the family's two-story white house on Route 82. The police believe the fire was set to cover up the killings in this small Dutchess County town.  The man, Manuel A. Morey, 33, and his wife, Tina Morey, 30, died of gunshot wounds, the authorities said. The youngest child, Ryan, 6, died of blunt trauma to the head. The other children, Manuel, 13, and Adam, 10, were stabbed to death, according to the police.  Sgt. Robert Hogan, with the state police Troop K headquarters in Millbrook, said Mr. Morey was a known drug dealer who had an arrest record for minor offenses. ''He has an arrest record, but it's short and none of it is drug related,'' Sergeant Hogan said. Specific details about the offenses were not available Wednesday, he said.  It remained unclear what role, if any, drug dealing might have played in the killings. The police had not established a motive and had not identified any suspects as of Wednesday night. ''It's being investigated,'' Sergeant Hogan said of the possibility of a link between the killings and drug dealing. ''What sort of link it is, at this point -- your guess is as good as mine. But it's most definitely being explored.''  There were no signs of forced entry at the house, and investigators recovered many knives at the scene, though none have so far been linked with any of the children's wounds.  The fire was first reported at 3:15 a.m. Friday by a person who was driving by and saw the flames. About 15 minutes later, a resident reported a car on fire less than a mile away on Lomala Lane. The car, a purple Kia, had been taken from the Morey home, the police said. It was registered to Mr. Morey's father but was used by Mr. Morey, Sergeant Hogan said.  Investigators have been checking hospitals in the vicinity for anyone who recently sought treatment for what Sergeant Hogan called ''struggle wounds'' or burns or cuts to the hands or arms. Anyone with information about the case was asked to call the New York State Police at (845) 298-0398.  ",

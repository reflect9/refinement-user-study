It is as strong as it is transparent -- the bar stool, for example, can hold up to 300 pounds.  Both pieces are protected from ultraviolet rays so they can be used outdoors, and their curvy legs double as built-in storage compartments.

The lozenge-shaped Boheme, below left, was based on a hand-painted design from the 1970s. To create the new pattern, Ms. Taylor ''straightened the lines,'' she said, ''so it would repeat more easily.'' Midsummer, a delicate leaf pattern created in 2000, left, was merely simplified. ''It had been more mottled, more painterly, more textured,'' she said. The collection includes six other patterns. A double roll, 20.5 inches by 11 yards, sells for $60 at www.grahambrown.com or (800) 554-0887.  ELAINE LOUIE  CURRENTS: WALLPAPER  ",

In gold leaf or python, it is at home in the most formal setting; with a coat of paint, it is comfortable in a casual room.  ''It is a universal design that is highly adaptable,'' said Christopher Mount, the director of exhibitions and public programs at Parsons the New School for Design in New York. ''It never looks dated.''  The original Parsons table was designed in the 1930s by Jean-Michel Frank and a group of design students at Parsons Paris, where he was a visiting critic. Since then, the table, with its squared legs, has been made in many sizes and materials. Depending on its size, it can be used as a console, a desk, a dining table, a coffee table or a small end table.  1. An 18-by-60-by-29 1/2-inch-high console table covered in python skin is $10,000 at Edelman Leather; to the trade only, at edelmanleather.com or (800) 886-8339.  2.

New tools and accessories not only enhance the experience, but also make welcome gifts from weekend houseguests. And for those who enjoy barbecuing, there is a special fireplace grill for ''cooking out'' indoors.  1. FlameX deluxe safety gloves, made of heavyweight leather, are flexible enough to use when working with logs or tools. The palms have a layer of insulating leather and are lined with foil for extra protection. The gloves are not fireproof; $27 a pair at spitjack.com or (800) 755-5509.  2. Forest Hill, a hand-forged steel four-piece tool set from Stone County Ironworks, is $696; for information: stoneiron.com or (800) 223-4722.  3. Fireglass can be used in gas fireplaces as a decorative accent. The tempered glass chips do not burn, so they don't need to be replaced. Filler Fireglass, used for the bottom layer, comes in more than a dozen colors ($2.90 to $10 a pound), while brightly colored Topping Fireglass ($7.50 to $9 a pound) can be sprinkled over it to create a striking look. A calculator on the company's Web site helps determine how much glass is needed for a specific fireplace; woodlanddirect.com or (800) 919-1904.  4. The Al Fresco fireplace is an outdoor fire pit made of recycled iron. Handmade in Haiti, it varies slightly in size, about 31 inches in diameter and 24 inches high; $250 at sundancecatalog.com or (800) 422-2770.  5.

''I thought it would be fun to do an assemblage of things for the boudoir,'' said Ms. de la Falaise. The collection includes a 41/3-inch-high goblet called the Deco Timbale ($45), top right, that can hold makeup brushes, and the Deco round box ($75), left. There are also square trays ($50 to $65) that can be used to protect furniture from water marks left by, say, a vase of flowers or bottle of Champagne. The collection is available at Annie O., the Hotel on Rivington, 105-107 Rivington Street (Ludlow Street), (212) 475-3490.  ELAINE LOUIE  CURRENTS: ACCESSORIES  ",

Randall Sandlin, the company's director of industrial design, says the new vacuum has a three-inch gap between the nozzle and the dust bag -- unlike many uprights that have coiling hoses as long as three feet -- which results in better suction because the dirt has a shorter distance to travel. ''Think about it this way,'' he said. ''It's easier to drink through a straw than a garden hose.'' The Electrolux is also compact. It folds down for easy storage and weighs 16 pounds, less than most family dogs. It will be available later this month at Lowe's (lowes.com) for $299.99.

            "text": "  THE most ordinary household objects -- even drawer pulls or measuring cups -- can seem exotic when they are purchased in a foreign marketplace. But not everyone has time to travel, so some stores are bringing the bazaar concept home, setting up their own versions of souks. Many of the bazaars are temporary, and the merchandise is carried in limited quantities -- when it is sold out, that's it.  Target's Global Bazaar runs through Feb. 17. Furnishings from 22 countries -- including Thailand, Italy, China and Peru -- are available in the company's stores and, in some cases, online; target.com or (800) 440-0680.  1. A beaded vase ($39.99) and jar ($34.99) are from China.  2. A large basket ($39.99) and a smaller one ($19.99) are also from China.  3. A weathered two-drawer jewelry box is made in Peru of wood ($59.99).  Circa Trade, in the Hudson Supermarket in Hudson, N.Y., sells furnishings from countries like India, China, Uzbekistan, Burma and the Philippines. (Courtney Pyle, the owner, had a similar shop in Pune, India, in the late 1990s.) Furniture and accessories can be purchased at 310 Warren Street in Hudson; for information: (212) 656-1378 or circatrade.com.  4. A quilted throw made of antique Indian saris is $360, and a wood santos figure from the Philippines is $6,500.  5. A carved wood, horned mask from Burma is $980.  6. Ceramic drawer pulls from India are $2 to $4.  The Conran Shop has assembled 170 ordinary home products, new and vintage, in a collection called ''Everyday Domestic Products From Around the World.'' From today through Feb. 25, items from places including France, India, Wales, Austria and Syria will be displayed at the store under tarps, as if in an outdoor market: 407 East 59th Street; (866) 755-9079 or conranusa.com.  7. A powder-coated steel stacking chair from France is $195 in white, red or silver.  8. A cone-shaped tin measuring cup from England is $18.  9. Vintage wool blankets from Wales, in different plaids and various sizes, are $175 to $190.  10. Buckets of assorted sizes made in Syria of recycled automotive tires can organize magazines ($135) or small desk items ($18).  PERSONAL SHOPPER  ",

            "text": "  FAST fashion collections like those of Karl Lagerfeld, Stella McCartney and Isaac Mizrahi have brought good design to the masses, but what have they brought to designers?  ''Obviously, it's cash,'' said Jack McCollough, half of the designing duo behind the ultraducky label Proenza Schouler, which Target will begin selling next month. Instead of $1,525 jackets at Bergdorf Goodman, it will be $39.99 cotton blazers at Target -- oh, the bliss of economy of scale.  ''We're a small company, and we need all the income we can get,'' Mr. McCollough said. ''It's also really great exposure.''  Mr. McCollough and his design partner, Lazaro Hernandez, are so enamored with their Target collection that for four days, beginning Feb. 2, they plan to transform the Opening Ceremony store in SoHo into a pop-up Proenza Schouler for Target boutique. Humberto Leon, an owner of the store, said he will begin selling the luxury Proenza Schouler line in Los Angeles when an Opening Ceremony store is opened there in April.  Like the Luella Bartley and Behnaz Sarafpour collections that have been sold at Target, the Proenza Schouler line could be described as representing the best of their past hits: a palm print skirt for $24.99, a hooded cotton anorak for $39.99, a silk camisole with trapunto topstitching for $49.99.  Designing for Target and for other projects -- a watch for Movado, a camera case for Hewlett-Packard -- has enabled Mr. McCollough and Mr. Hernandez to develop their business more quickly than most fashion upstarts. With their business partner, Shirley Cook, they recently bought out their sole investor, Markus H\u00f6fels, a private venture capitalist in Berlin. They also signed a license to create sunglasses with L'amy, the French eyewear company, which they will show in September.  By now, designers like Mr. McCollough and Mr. Hernandez have figured out how to differentiate their work so as not to turn off those who prefer their Proenza Schouler at Bergdorf. The focus of their Target line is day wear, with bright colors, cotton sweatshirts and pajama-inspired tops. New for Target is a Proenza Schouler crest, printed on sweatshirts, with the silhouette of an Italian greyhound (based on an office regular named Baloney) encircled in a laurel wreath.  ''That kind of stuff is easier to make a little richer,'' Mr. McCollough said. ''It's hard to make a cheaper lace look expensive.''  FRONT ROW  ",

            "text": "  Though this hasn't been a fur-coat-worthy New York winter, Ignacio Figueras, a professional polo player and model from Argentina, found plenty of chill in the air on a visit to Central Park. ''I don't usually spend time in cold places,'' said Mr. Figueras, who is known as Nacho, ''so it was a good change for me.''  Mr. Figueras, 29, follows the polo circuit year-round, playing in Palm Beach, Fla., in the spring, the Hamptons in the summer and Argentina in the fall. He describes his sport as ''elegant and classic, but also modern,'' adding, ''There is something very sexy about a guy on a horse.'' Perhaps with that in mind, Ralph Lauren chose him to be the face of its latest men's fragrance, Polo Double Black, which came out last fall.  ''I always go to the side of elegant,'' Mr. Figueras said of his style. ''I wear suits to parties because I'd rather make the mistake of being too dressed than not dressed enough.'' Here, he wears a custom-made shirt that belonged to his grandfather, an Herm\u00e8s scarf, Seven for All Mankind jeans and Prada boots. His coat is by Ralph Lauren.  Mr. Figueras, who is married, with two small children, heads to his horse-breeding farm outside Buenos Aires between seasons. ''I ride almost every day,'' said Mr. Figueras, who owns 100 horses, ''so I always wear jeans and T-shirts.''  His other fashion essential is heavy-duty bleach. ''It's an obligation to wear white jeans when you play, and they get very dirty,'' he said. ''I go through four pairs in a season.''  JENNIFER TUNG  PULSE: WHAT I'M WEARING NOW  ",

Two sisters, Cara Stone-Pfeifer, 46, an interior designer, and Elizabeth Rad, 48, a real estate developer, conceived the home-and-garden supply shop, which they opened in TriBeCa last month, as an alternative to a big-box superstore. Their goal, said Ms. Stone-Pfeifer, below left, was ''to take the anxiety out of shopping by offering the single best and most functional things in every category of home accessories.''  The merchandise they carry includes ipe wood shelves with a mahogany finish designed by Ms. Stone-Pfeifer (starting at $275) and orchid flower arrangements ($145), top right; all-purpose white porcelain plates ($11 each), center right, on a wooden serving tray ($45), both by Guy Degrenne; and, bottom right, a hand-blown glass vase from Portugal ($80). In addition to kitchen, bath and garden accessories and furniture, Tribbles also offers architectural, interior and floral design services; 217 West Broadway (Franklin Street), (212) 965-8480.

            "text": "  SINCE the most effective Hollywood stylists are probably to be found behind the scenes, Rachel Zoe's presence in the front row at the Chanel haute couture show could only mean that she wanted people to see her. Putting aside the mental block that forms at the mention of the words Hollywood stylist, Rachel Zoe was giving herself a special role.  This seems a good place to say that she is promoting a false assumption, namely that the couture collections are tailor-made for the red carpet. Actually, the couture collections are tailor-made for about 500 people in the world who have the means or the connections to get an $80,000 dress, and the rest is just ballyhoo to sell the cheaper commercial stuff.  True, one or two houses will specially make dresses for the Oscars, as Chanel did for Penelope Cruz for the Golden Globes.  But the red carpet is really a concession to middle American tastes; if you stopped to analyze it long enough, if you added up the number of ruched or beaded dresses trucking down the carpet, you wouldn't have Paris or even Hollywood. You'd have the suburbs of Detroit on a good night. And that's not a put-down to Detroit; it's a statement that many affluent people nowadays have access to stylish clothes.  Haute couture is a different game. Not only do you need piles of money, but you have to able to project yourself into a candy-pink pencil suit with what looks like a Japanese origami bird coming off the back. This was the essence of John Galliano's couture show for Dior, a feat of artistry and contemporary imagination.  Of course, a stylist can ask to have the bird removed (not wishing to solicit comparisons to Bjork's famous dead swan outfit), and a house will do that, since the purpose of couture is to suit the client. But the stylist, by reason of self-interest and limited vision, will never be able to duplicate the experience of the couture show. That's why couture stands apart more and more from the red carpet. It is, in fact, everything that the red carpet is not. It is strange, difficult, emotionally affecting and accessible to relatively few.  Witness the gloomy brilliance of Riccardo Tisci's clothes for Givenchy, shown on Tuesday evening on a wet stone floor, with the models dragging their long silk trains. On the whole, the point of view was immature. Yet the cut and the elongated line of a navy suede coat, rippling softly down the front and worn with a trailing skirt in navy silk, left no doubt that Mr. Tisci was proposing a distinct silhouette.  This has been a season of the salon, with Mr. Galliano literally evoking the dove gray atmosphere of Dior, and Karl Lagerfeld opening the Chanel show by rolling out a cream-colored carpet and ending the presentation with the staff of the house, including the heads, or premi\u00e8res, of the workrooms, seated class-portrait-style opposite the audience.  In a collection that was easily his best for Dior, and certainly his most coherent, Mr. Galliano did not spare Paris embroiderers, who gave him dragonflies and tiny, three-dimension birds, or his fabric suppliers, who made him gazar and organdy in dense triple weights, or his seamstresses and tailors, who stitched, pleated and pressed the origami folds so that they were immaculate and perfectly integrated into the whole outfit.  But what you mainly felt about Mr. Galliano's work this season was how original the colors were: the sugary pinks, the lime and sea-foam greens, the shades of brown darkening to black on a long dress formed by ribbon strips of fabric that had been inspired by Japanese baskets. From the point of view of someone who is not artistic, it was daunting to realize that these colors did not spring from a book or a painting but, rather, from Mr. Galliano's mind.  That's one difference between a designer and a couturier. Another is the ability to give a new proportion at the right moment. This was Mr. Lagerfeld's strength this season, though he, too, had amazing colors like a purple heliotrope gray and a creamy white with a hint of blue. In nearly every dress, including mini-coatdresses and long evening numbers, the waist was slightly higher than normal and belted, so that the legs looked longer.  Mr. Lagerfeld imparted a vertical line in other ways: with a jacket made entirely from handmade strips of tweed braid; with dresses that had sheer bodies ribbed with piped organdy or tulle, and a beautiful two-piece leopard-print silk dress traced at the hem in silver embroidery. In nearly 25 years at Chanel, Mr. Lagerfeld said it was the first time he had thought to use the print.  Valentino, in his 45th year in fashion, delivered a superb collection, opening with a floaty ivory satin jacket and matching cutout skirt. Everything about the clothes, loosely inspired by a show he did in 1968, suggested lightness, from the dominance of white to the youthful volumes and cloudlike coats. Valentino frustrates when he piles things on -- the lips too red, the gowns too embellished.  Not this time. A slim, many-tiered dress in white silk looked elegant and easy, while the grainy and ottoman textures of the cream fabrics seemed to pay homage to Robert Ryman.  Christian Lacroix seemed mired in weird proportions and colors. Jean Paul Gaultier's Catholic procession of ethereal drapes and stained-glass embroidery was fun and imaginative. I've never seen a couture bride look like Jesus. The collection had a kitsch quality, but also a modern glamour.  The striking thing about Giorgio Armani's maharajah-inspired silks, some embroidered with semiprecious stones, was the shape they imparted. This was a deft collection, though not just because it involved more Parisian heft than we've seen from Mr. Armani. It worked because he had something new to say in the cut, clearly conveyed by a simple dress in beige micro-check silk with a narrow, elongated waist and an exaggerated shoulder. The same line appeared in jackets.  When told before the show that a silver embroidered gown seemed bound for the Oscars, Mr. Armani looked critically at the dress and smiled. Through a translator, he said, ''Maybe for a maharajah, but not the Oscars.''  FASHION REVIEW  ",

            "text": "  MANY years ago, I lived in Spain for a summer, teaching English at 5:45 a.m. to a group of pharmaceutical executives, most of whom knew only three words in English at the onset of the season: ''yes'' (enthusiastic bobbing of heads), ''no'' (sad frowns) and ''marketing'' (big smiles and thumbs-up gestures).  Every day I took the subway to work with the city's construction workers, stopping for a sherry and a coffee (this is what the construction workers did, at least, and I always say, when in Madrid ) and a churro, which considering the Dunkin' Donuts society we live in, might be described as a smaller, lighter bear claw.  Unfortunately I was the most impatient teacher on the planet -- or maybe it was the 5 a.m. sherry -- and at the end of the summer that remained pretty much the extent of what my students knew.  Everyone in Spain, I noticed, wore beautiful leather shoes. Like the Italians, the Spanish have a thing for footwear. In SoHo, we now have our own Spanish outpost in the newly opened T\u00e9 Casan, a 7,500-square-foot emporium for shoes alone.  The name of the store comes from the Gaelic phrase for ''a woman's path,'' but that sounds like a self-help book for women going through menopause, so I prefer the Spanish translation. If you don't count the accent on the first word, it translates as ''they marry you,'' and frankly I felt married to at least two pairs of the shoes by the time I left.  T\u00e9 Casan, the brainchild of a Spanish entrepreneur, has brought together young designers with experience at Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, Versace and Dries van Noten, among others.  The aesthetic is deeply evocative of Barcelona, a city known for its dripping Gaud\u00ed cathedral and avant-garde artistic environment. It's a place where somewhere, any time of year, you can catch a staged version of Ionesco's ''Cantatrice Chauve.''  The store's gimmick is that it offers high-quality shoes at relatively inexpensive prices, and it plans to change the merchandise and designs every few weeks. I think $400 to $850 is a lot to spend on a pair of shoes, but in recent years well-to-do American women have been suckered into a bewildering fashion conspiracy.  To anyone who looks at Vogue or W, it would appear that in order to be fashionable, to be stylish -- to be, in fact, footwear -- shoes must cost $700. There is something dark about this, as if we have become Stepford Wives, marching off to the high-end shoe brands as if our brains had been sucked out of our skulls and replaced with slots for charge cards. Ka-ching.  At T\u00e9 Casan, the message is change and exclusivity: each style is manufactured in limited numbers, as the salesclerks will eagerly tell you. These editions, according to the company literature, are limited by state. So if a designer makes 80 pairs of the same shoe in size 40, there may be 80 women in New York wearing the same shoe in the same size. Not all that different from other small-scale designers.  The heels generally have a more modest cant than your average Jimmy Choo but less of the grandmotherly quality and faux duck-toed modesty of shoes at, say, Anthropologie.  HAVE you noticed that while models in fashion magazines two decades ago stood with their feet in a proud position, straight forward and elegant, all the models and celebrities now seem to stand with their feet turned inward, knock-kneed as if they were ashamed, or 10 years old? When was the last time you saw a model in the J. Crew catalog standing with her feet straight out?  This seems to be part of an ongoing infantilization of the American woman, along with an obsession for weighing 90 pounds. A shoe is a shoe, after all, not a statement of virginity or, perhaps, faux-virginity.  This is why I like the shoes at T\u00e9 Casan so much. They do not force the wearer into a kind of submissive frailty. A designer named Manuela Filipovic did a pair (much photographed in the news media) with a solid heel and Art Deco-esque winged scrolls on either side, in black or green suede -- very 1980s Maud Frizon.  Niki Robinson, one of the more avant-garde designers at the store, offers flat boots made of leather, fronted with madras patchwork made from men's work shirts, snapped shut with wooden buttons.  Gaetano Perrone's shoes are shaped like pagodas, some with six-inch-wide taffeta bows at the back. There are cherry-red platform pumps with a square toe; evening sandals are made from woven strands of metal. Fay.B's leather boots, plain on the outside with a hint of apricot metallic lining at the top, are $385.  The space itself could pass for a chic restaurant. Although it was designed by Ron Pompei, the man behind Anthropologie, it is a cleaner, more space-age gallery. A large central glass staircase is edged with mirrored circles; an open dressing room offers semiprivacy for the serious fetishists -- sorry, I mean fashionistas.  After trying on a dozen pairs, I was surprised to see that the clerk was still remarkably cheerful. To be waited on by a shoe clerk with such patience was as miraculous as if my Spanish pharmaceutical students had learned to recite ''Paradise Lost'' in two short months.  T\u00e9 Casan  382 West Broadway (near Spring Street); (212) 584-8000  ATMOSPHERE -- Jetsons meets Arte Povera in an all-white boutique.  SERVICE -- As is common with much-publicized new stores, excellent. Time will tell if it remains so.  PRICES -- Metallic sneaker bootie, $210; black, gold and cream leather pumps, $245; red patent-leather platforms, $315; flat patchwork madras and leather boots, $425; satin evening sandals with rhinestones, $395.  EXTRAS -- Booths for privacy; tea bar downstairs. On two visits the bar was unattended. (Memo to stores: Give it a break; we get our caffeine elsewhere.)  Critical Shopper  ",

            "text": "  For centuries, kimonos were decorated with patterns using paper stencils called katagami, made from three layers of rice paper and treated with persimmon juice. The technique is now a dying art, but Hiromi Ishii, an artist in Tokyo, has found a way to resurrect the one-of-a-kind stencils -- as paper lanterns.  Mr. Ishii takes stencils dating from the late 19th century to the 1940s, backs them with new rice paper and attaches them to iron frames wired to hold 25-watt bulbs. The katagami lights are manufactured in two shapes: rectangular and cylindrical. The rectangular lanterns come in 18-inch and 24-inch versions (the smaller, below, is $1,300), and the cylindrical ones are 18 inches high (above, $1,300). Prices range from $1,300 to $1,500.

            "text": "  Q. What is the best way to clean leather furniture?  A. In general, smooth leather surfaces need to be wiped with a damp cloth to remove any dust or grime. Because of exposure to central heating, the sun and other environmental factors, most leather also requires moisture to keep it from cracking, flaking or splitting. Think about your own skin in winter, or worse, the disintegrating 1930s leather club chairs found at flea markets around the world.  Once or twice a year I break out a tin of saddle soap and a sponge moistened with a little warm water, and lather up everything made of leather in the house, from a briefcase I bought in Buenos Aires to the seats of my Greek Revival-style dining chairs. The secret is to use the saddle soap sparingly; a minuscule amount is enough to clean and moisturize. After the soap has dried, I buff the leather with a soft, dry cloth.  ''People get carried away when it comes to cleaning leather,'' said Teddy Edelman, a founder of Edelman Leather, a Connecticut firm whose leather furniture, upholstery, floor tiles and rugs are favorites with top interior designers.  She has heard horror stories of leather being subjected to inappropriate cleaning agents including furniture polish. (I once cleaned a lovely cowhide desktop with the abrasive side of a kitchen scrubbing sponge, which resulted in a number of disfiguring abrasions.)  ''Leather is like your skin,'' Mrs. Edelman said. ''It's basically resistant to dirt, so there's no reason to overclean it.''  In addition to saddle soap, Mrs. Edelman said, ''a tiny bit of Castile soap, just a couple of drops in a quart of warm water, applied with a barely moist sponge or cloth, works well too.''  When her antique Biedermeier chairs start looking ''a bit exhausted,'' she added, she refreshes their leather upholstery with Lexol conditioner. For information and store locations, lexol.com or (800) 241-6996.  Q. How do I get rid of a heavily textured ceiling?  A. Most of my childhood bedroom was great: my mother let me decorate one wall with a huge orange fishing net, which I studded with starfish, glass weights and other nautical gear picked up along the Embarcadero in San Diego. But the ceiling looked as if it had been finished with cake frosting. Since then, I haven't been able to abide textured ceilings.  Before you do anything, break off a few small samples and have them tested for asbestos by an Environmental Protection Agency-approved lab. (You can find an appropriate lab in the Yellow Pages under Asbestos Removal.) If the asbestos is found, your best solution is to cover the ceiling with a layer of Sheetrock. But if you get the all-clear and you are handy, then move everything out of the room and cover the floor with dropcloths, newspapers or contractor's paper (which comes in large rolls), and get ready for a very messy operation. There will be lots of dust, so wear a disposable mask.  The only way to remove a textured spray-on surface is to moisten and scrape it, small section by small section. Fill a pump sprayer with warm water and carefully soak a four-by-four-foot area of the surface until it is wet enough to be removed with a trowel or a metal scraper. Your goal is to get down to the underlying ceiling, which is likely gypsum board. You may have to go over the ceiling a couple of times to get rid of it all.  Once the textured gunk is gone, break out a pole sander and gently sand the ceiling until it is as smooth as possible. Patch any scrapes or gouges with joint compound and sand again once those repairs are thoroughly dry. Now the ceiling is ready to prime and paint.  ",

            "text": "  HADASS KANTOROWICZ is on the fence. ''I eat less meat than I used to,'' said Ms. Kantorowicz, a self-described tantric healer who stopped in last week at Organic Avenue, a vegan general store in downtown Manhattan. ''I'm definitely a lot more conscious than I used to be.'' While she appreciates the virtues of a meat-free diet, she stops short of embracing a vegan way of life, one that would ask her to forsake a croc-embossed bag or patent leather pumps. ''And I'm not ready to wear hemp,'' she confided.  But a proliferation of vegan-friendly fashions and stores that ban animal products outright from their shelves may tempt her to change her tune. If she has yet to adopt the zero-tolerance approach advocated by the most militant vegetarians, she typifies the customer that many vegan marketers are now courting.  National chains like Whole Foods; boutiques like MooShoes, a New York outlet for imitation-leather wallets, belts and bags; online stores like Pangea; and eco-minded labels like Moral Fiber, Real Fake, Novacas (no cows) and Matt & Nat are encouraging shoppers, even those merely flirting with a ''cruelty free'' diet, to embrace its precepts not just in the kitchen but in their wardrobes. To their minds, vegan chic, once an oxymoron, is a glossy new marketing handle. Clothes and accessories once shunned for their aura of hair-shirt deprivation have acquired a hint of luxury.  Vegans, who may be thought of as extreme vegetarians, strive for a diet and way of life that is noninjurious to both animals and the environment, directly or through the processing of materials like leather, wool or silk. From motives of conscience or health, most reject shoes and clothing made from hides, even those made with animal-based glues and dyes.  ''People are more conscious today of what they're wearing, why they're wearing it and how it affects the environment,'' said Robert Burke, a fashion retail consultant in New York. To ignore such issues ''is not sexy today,'' he said.  Six months ago Denise Mari opened Organic Avenue on the Lower East Side. ''At one time being vegan meant focusing on what you had to give up,'' she said. ''Today we're stepping beyond the mundane what-you-need-to-survive approach'' and concentrating instead on ''how to make this a fun lifestyle that other people can relate to.''  ''We'd like people to say, 'Wow, look how fashionable this is! I want it for its style.' ''  At her shop Ms. Mari sells hemp and bamboo tanks and shirtdresses, and even men's suits made from ahimsa silk, a fiber processed without injuring silkworms ($700).  Certainly Ms. Mari and other merchants are beneficiaries of a spike in the vegetarian population. As of last year, there were an estimated 4.8 million vegetarians in the United States, one-third to one-half of them vegan, according to the Vegetarian Resource Group, a nonprofit educational organization. That number has nearly doubled since 1997.  But today retailers and designers are aiming at potential customers identified in a survey last year by Mintel International, a consumer research company, as ''occasional vegetarians.'' They shop vegan selectively, as the Mintel study pointed out, but their ''purchasing power is paramount.''  This health- and eco-conscious population has contributed most visibly to the growth of a $1.2 billion market for vegetarian goods (primarily dairy, egg, cheese, meat and poultry substitutes and tofu), according to Mintel, one that jumped 63.5 percent between 2000 and 2005.  Just a half-dozen years ago, shoppers searching for cow-friendly wares had to resort to shoes from Payless, ''vegan'' by virtue of their synthetic materials, or to utility plastic or canvas boots, wallets and backpacks sold through Vegan Essentials, one of a handful of online stores. Now even a few mass marketers are incorporating stylish vegan products into their lines. Vans promotes its Geoff Rowley vegan skateboarding shoes, made from synthetic nubuck and rubber. Rampage, a mall brand, is advertising ''cruelty free'' imitation leather styles.  In New York an outcropping of eco-conscious boutiques carries goods that would pass muster with even the strictest vegetarians. Kaight, a five-month-old store on the Lower East Side, offers hand-stitched dresses of recycled cashmere and wool; organic denim jeans; and Linda Loudermilk dresses made from Lyocell, a biodegradable wood pulp fiber ($275). NY Artificial, in the meatpacking district of all places, sells one-of-a-kind synthetic suede and leather bags ($275 to $475) and corset-wide belts made from vegetal, a canvas coated with tree sap.  ''There is a market for these designs,'' said Alex Guzman, an owner. ''People want to do something about protecting animal and human rights and the environment. But they don't want to be carrying a canvas tote, the kind you buy in bookstores.''  On the luxury level, Stella McCartney, long an activist for animal rights, sells canvas, linen, Lucite and imitation leather shoes and handbags, which, despite prices in the $800 range, have an avid following.  Some of the new customers are picky, cooling their cowhide heels as they hold out for quality wares. Judith Green, a education consultant, was happy to try on a wrap dress made of recycled cashmere at Kaight, but balked at the selection of synthetic shoes. ''I haven't found the wear and the comfort of a hand-stitched Italian leather shoe,'' she said. ''If I did, I would trade in my own.''  There is a strong incentive to offer vegan versions of products seen in more conventional stores, said Deborah Wasserman, a director of the Vegetarian Resource Group. It is not uncommon, she noted, to find sexy, form-fitting PVC biker jackets, plastic iPod cases and stilettos. Such styles appeal to environmentalists and dedicated vegans alike, she said, contributing to a measurable growth in the vegan fashion resources.  To find them, ''you don't have to go to the hemp store,'' said Marcia Mogelonsky, a research analyst at Mintel. Whole Foods and health food co-ops are becoming general stores, selling hemp shower curtains, bamboo flooring and organic cotton T-shirts along with flaxseed and tofu turkey.  Last year the vegan movement spawned the Vegan Fashion Blog, which trumpets the aesthetic virtues of Rampage cotton canvas totes, Chinese Laundry gold-tone plastic sandals, Baby Phat boots with ankle charms and Lands' End ''toasty'' faux-suede gloves.  Such items have particular appeal to fashion indies, whose numbers proliferate on college campuses, where vegan dining rooms are no longer uncommon. ''College students are much more invested in a lifestyle that allows them to think nothing of wearing pleather,'' Ms. Mogelonsky said. ''They have grown up on the three R's: reduce, recycle, reuse.''  ''They are more likely to adopt vegan fashion,'' she added, ''because unlike the baby boomers, to them it isn't 'weird.' ''  Indeed, there are hints that some young would-be hipsters are feeling the pressure to conform. ''Here all my friends think eating and shopping vegan is the cool thing to do,'' said Ms. Kantorowicz, the healer, who recently moved to New York from Seattle. The movement has derived impetus from fashion celebrities like Ms. McCartney and from the entertainment world as well.  ''Certainly Hollywood has been a big promoter,'' Ms. Wasserman said, citing the powers of professed vegans like Natalie Portman, Alicia Silverstone, Woody Harrelson and Joaquin Phoenix.  Their vehemence has prompted some trend-conscious shoppers to embrace vegan wares, if not vegan values. At Stella McCartney, they buy the shoes and bags favored by Ms. Portman and her peers. ''Most of these people don't care whether the shoes are leather or not,'' said Tiziana Lanza, the brand's retail manager in the United States. ''They buy for the cachet and the design.''  Jack McKeever, a singer, musician and sometime vegetarian, stopped by Organic Avenue last week partly because he was hoping to buy an ahimsa silk suit that had earlier caught his eye. He admired the fabric and the look, he said. ''If these people can compete aesthetically, I say, 'Rock on!' ''  ",

            "text": "  DUMBO, the nickname for the neighborhood Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, sounds like an acronym made up by a developer. But there's nothing prefab or Disney-esque about the place.  Rather, on a dreary January afternoon, Dumbo resembles the set of ''Blade Runner,'' or some futuristic movie in which humans and robots and aliens with tentacles coming out of their foreheads hang out playing chess or shooting one another with purple lasers in a seamy wharfside bar. Turn-of-the-century brownstones nestle at the flanks of high-rise apartment buildings. A train, subterranean in other parts of the city but high overhead here, crisscrosses a rickety-looking platform next to the thrumming automobile traffic on the bridge. It's Jetsons meets Dickens, old and new playing out as urban theater.  On the thoroughfare below, a hardware store stands near a glossy West Elm outpost. On Front Street, a deli with fluorescent lights is not far from a high-end organic grocery store on Adams Street called Foragers Market. It's safe to say the only foraging going on in Foragers is the search for the American Express platinum card at the bottom of one's handbag.  If one store best represents Front Street in Dumbo, it is Loopy Mango, a transplant from the East Village that opened in September. The store, a glossy gallery of a space, sells vintage clothes and antiques alongside smart, new fashion and jewelry from designers like Tufi Duek, Tocca, Rachel Roy and Tracy Reese.  A study in contrasts, Loopy Mango offers old and new, exotic and prim -- sometimes in the same item. A denim utility suit by Deener, brand-new and stiff, was $275 and just the thing someone might need for a Devo reunion party. Next to it, a dusty framed photograph of kittens cost $75. A black Julie Haus pleated silk chiffon dress was $375. Nearby, a tiny antlered skull mounted on a wooden plaque was $68.  A very modern Alexis Hudson handbag in black patent leather sat in the front window atop a giant leather women's wedge-soled sandal, an antique shoemaker's advertisement that was on sale for $750. And, I'd venture to guess, it will be on sale for some time to come. Dresses by Robert Rodriguez and swingy coats by Twinkle mingled with pieces of vintage Dior luggage.  One of founders of Loopy Mango, Waejong Kim, is a crochet artist, and the store has become something of a destination for crochet fetishists. Crochet became popular in Europe in the 1800s as a less costly replacement for lace, and went on to become the hobby of grandmothers with time on their hands. On my childhood kitchen table, for instance, the salt and pepper shakers were covered in tiny cozies crocheted to resemble small men with pointy hats.  They were made for us by our neighbor, Mrs. Iverson, who spent her time crocheting, worrying about how to camouflage unsightly salt and pepper shakers and perfecting her Salisbury steak recipe. We kept them on the table for reasons I never quite understood. I think perhaps my mother worried that the delicate Mrs. Iverson might pop over for a surprise visit, see her cozies weren't in situ, and drop dead from a heart attack.  Eventually we moved, and the cozies were phased out. The 1970s saw a rise in the granny square, and I admit I played a small part in the manufacture of a large caftan.  But the Loopy Mango crocheted products are unlike any crochet work you have seen. Imagine a one-piece cutout bathing suit that Pam Anderson might wear to her next wedding, but crocheted in pink and mint-green yarn. Or a pair of cherry earrings, in crochet. Or a sparkling flame-red see-through minidress, in crochet. Or a crocheted pompom necklace. Or a crocheted dog caftan with matching crocheted pompom leash, and coordinating human outfit in pink and green crochet. I might wear one of the flapper-style crocheted hats with the large crocheted flowers. Might.  The store stocks an interesting assortment of jewelry: gold and silver birds on delicate chains by Jackrabbit; necklaces mixing new and vintage pieces by Bazz. I liked the Arte Povera style of Gaye Soley, who mixes rubber and pearls and metal in each piece. For $150, I bought a necklace for my stepdaughter. Everyone should skip the gift-giving in December and instead give presents in January, that great yawning Monday of a month when things turn really depressing.  A DISPLAY of Eau de Brooklyn soap ($10 each) was on sale near some vintage books, including ''The Blue Flower'' by Henry van Dyke ($40), an American clergyman who wrote fairy tales with a religious bent. I opened ''The Blue Flower'' and read: ''He felt an irresistible desire to bathe in the pool. Slipping off his clothes he plunged in. It was as if he bathed in a cloud of sunset. A celestial rapture flowed through him. The waves of the stream were like a bevy of nymphs taking shape around him, clinging to him with tender breasts, as he floated onward, lost in delight, yet keenly sensitive to every impression.''  A clergyman longing for the touch of nymphs' breasts, a boutique for disco crochet in Brooklyn: in the shadow of the Manhattan bridge, it all made sense.  Loopy Mango  117 Front Street (between Adams and Washington Streets), Brooklyn; (718) 858-5930  ATMOSPHERE -- An art gallery of old and new, offering clothing and antiques and art and perfume and jewelry.  SERVICE -- Helpful and friendly. The proprietors speak English, Russian, Japanese and Korean.  KEY LOOKS -- Crocheted hot pants and vintage housedresses.  PRICES -- 1920s linen cabinet, $600; Tocca red cotton dress, $352; Mischen silk dress, $750; Rachel Roy sweater dress, $280; handmade leather bag with horn handle, on sale for $325.

Ms. Trico, above, has been selling chandeliers to friends for years, but since one of her fixtures -- a five-foot frame decorated with gilded cutlery and 500 teardrop crystals -- was installed in the Cacao Bar at MarieBelle in SoHo two months ago, her work has been generating public interest. ''Customers are constantly asking about it,'' said Maribel Lieberman, the store's owner. ''It's really a conversation starter.''

            "text": "  BRAD PITT may be striving mightily to downplay his heartthrob image -- he even sported gray stubble and crow's feet in ''Babel'' -- so this probably is not going to help. The truth is that probably no male star today has the power to ignite a fashion trend like Mr. Pitt can. With the help of the trend-setting costume designer Michael Kaplan, he did it with the retro-70s hip-length leather jacket in ''Fight Club.'' Now he has done it with the fedora.  Of course, black hip-hop stars and actors, from Run-D.M.C. to Jamie Foxx, have long dallied with the old-school chapeau. And lately entertainers like Jack White, Pete Doherty and Justin Timberlake have tried on the look. But it took off with a wider (that is, whiter) spectrum of stylish men only after July 2005, when Mr. Pitt, alongside his new flame, Angelina Jolie, appeared in a 60-page shoot in W magazine shot by Steven Klein and styled by Mr. Kaplan. In it Mr. Pitt wore several deeply stylish straw fedoras.  Since then, as several of the coolest hatters report, sales of fedoras have snowballed with hip, younger customers. Marcia Akins, the owner and designer of the Makins line, said sales of her hats had more than doubled in the 18 months since the article ran.  Orlando Palacios, the Worth & Worth owner and designer, also credited Mr. Pitt's style with jump-starting a remarkable uptick in business in the last two years. ''Brad loves his lids,'' he said. ''I've had a lot of younger guys coming in, wanting something so they can look a little more contemporary.''  Fedora -- contemporary? Is this the same hat famously given the heave-ho by President Kennedy almost 50 years ago as a dinosaur of prewar dress and manners? Well, in the first place, there is little difference between contemporary and old hat at a time when half the clothes sold look as if they were designed for time travelers from another decade, whether the '30s or '70s. Second, two things make the fedora modern: how it is now made, and how it is now worn.  As Mr. Palacios pointed out, the fedoras that younger men gravitate to are what the British call a trilby, with a narrower brim. They are about two and an eighth inches wide rather than a more traditional two and a quarter inches.  And as the selection of hand-blocked hats from Makins, Worth & Worth and Rod Keenan make clear, the usual fedora palette of gray, black and brown are a figment of the film noir era. Popping in crimson, yellow, blue and white and tricked out with crystals, feathers and hatbands made of crocodile or contrasting ribbon, today's fedoras would look at home on any villain in a '70s Pam Grier movie -- but executed with more finesse, and with a price tag to match -- from $300 to $1,500.  ''We kick it up with our trims,'' Mr. Keenan said, adding that he makes many styles, and one-of-a-kind pieces, because his customers like owning something unique.  But the new fedora wearers do not pander to a '70s pimp-style costume instinct. These stingy brims and sky pieces (vintage terms for natty hats) are not meant as the crowning glory of a full-dress look. Rather, they top off more ordinary, but still snappy, modern styles: a hoodie, a crisp suit, a polo shirt, a shirt and tie.  Mark Roberts, a filmmaker in Los Angeles, started wearing Mr. Keenan's hats to give a punch to his wardrobe of Gap shirts. ''Since I'm a bald man, they fight against skin cancer,'' he said. ''But from a style point of view, well, I just thought it was a cool time when all men wore hats. Each one has its own personality. That's why they've become addictive. It's like having all these different personalities to put on your head.''  Ant Rich, a manager of A & R at Jive Records in New York, has been a hat fan for a few years now. ''It goes back to, like, '02, when the hip-hop industry started dressing up a little bit,'' he said. But when a friend got him fitted for a custom hat at Mr. Keenan's Harlem studio as a birthday present, he became a staunch convert.  ''A fedora goes with a lot of different styles, which is the way I dress,'' Mr. Rich said. ''If I am being conservative, it can make me look cool. Or you can have on a white button-up shirt and some plain jeans and sneakers, but if you have on a Rod hat, you're going to stand out. It's hip-hop and Rat Pack all rolled into one.''  So it is a waste of hand-wringing to mourn the days when a fedora was an expected note of polish. Now it can do something even more charming: that is, strike an unexpected note.  DRESS CODES  ",

No wonder then that the latest Longchamp design -- a fitted trench coat in beige or black from the line's new ready-to-wear collection -- closes style gaps of its own. Made from French-milled cotton, the trench's deep jagged collar is dangerous enough for hipsters and sexy enough for grownups. Its no-fuss zippers soothe frenzied parents whose every car key and pacifier demands careful inventory.  The trench was also built to travel: its fabric is blissfully wrinkle-free.

            "text": "  GROWING up, I yearned to have lustrous straight hair that I could wear parted in the middle and let swing down my back, like Marcia Brady of ''The Brady Bunch'' or Laurie Partridge of ''The Partridge Family.''  Instead, amid a sea of long, silky-haired classmates, my zigzagging kinky curls were the target of childhood taunts. (It didn't help that my middle name, Claire, rhymed with hair.) Hairdressers hacked away at my unruly mop, unsure how to tame it.  Even after juice cans, hot rollers, hot combs, oversize brushes, irons, baby oil, gels and chemical relaxers, my hair would fight back, bouncing up time and again into Roseanne Roseannadanna frizz.  In recent years, at my pleading, stylists have blown my hair into stick-straight submission, and when I'm unable to get to a salon, I dip into a cupboard full of frizz-taming products that help uncoil my curls and keep me from looking like my cocker spaniel.  Some people have bad-hair days. Until recently I was resigned to a bad-hair life.  But a tide of new products aimed at eliminating frizz, without forcing curlies to go blown-out straight, has entered the market.  Curls, from Nicole Kidman's Botticelli ringlets to Sarah Jessica Parker's soft tresses and Oprah Winfrey's tumbling locks, are in. Consequently, there is a swell of hair care regimens, including serums, gels, balms, creams and sprays promising moisture-rich curls, without frizz or flyaways.  ''People with curly hair don't tend to be denying it anymore,'' said Mercedes Orpin, product development manager at Bumble & Bumble. ''It's no longer an either-or. It's all about whatever suits your fancy these days. Now you can have it any way you like. It is like a smorgasbord for hair.''  In 1998, when Michelle Breyer and Gretchen Heber of Austin, Tex., both journalists, were at a loss for how to battle their own corkscrew hair, they started Naturallycurly.com, a Web site and social network. At the time, there were few hair care products aimed at the frizzy- and curly-haired.  ''For so long society has viewed people with curly or frizzy hair as that's not desirable, not attractive,'' said Ms. Breyer, 44, recalling how she relentlessly blew out her intensely curly hair during the ''Farrah Fawcett painful years.''  Dr. Mary Lamia, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst in Kentfield, Calif., said that feelings about one's hair run deep. Hair, after all, is a focal point of an individual's appearance, she said. For those with frizzy curly hair, she added, it can be ''a target for self-conscious feelings that can result in low self-esteem.''  ''Unfortunately, hair seems to have a mind of its own, and curly frizzy hair can be outright incorrigible,'' Dr. Lamia said. But, she added, ''Controlling one's hair seems to be important to humans in general -- an attempt to control the perceptions others have about one's appearance.'' Add in marketing, she said, and a generation of self-loathing curly-haired women has sprung up.  Ginetta Candelario, an associate professor of sociology and Latin American and Latina/o Studies at Smith College, said the compulsion to have pin-straight hair grew out of the American experience. At the turn of the 20th century, she said, European women, particularly Jewish, Italian and Greek women who tend to have darker, curlier hair, would do whatever it took to wear their hair straight as a way to assimilate into American society.  The Vidal Sassoon revolution in the beauty-culture industry perpetuated the positive association with straight hair.  ''It's not simply vanity on the part of women,'' Dr. Candelario said. ''In that setting, where the norm has been this lank-haired beauty, it becomes a source of a stigma, so you want to fix it.''  But that is changing. As mainstream hairstyle trends have become more diverse, a wider range of styles have become acceptable in the workplace, according to a November 2006 report on the $7.2 billion hair-care products market in the United States done by Packaged Facts, a publishing division of MarketResearch.com. And so, conservatively, there were about 70 frizz- and curl-related products introduced this year, compared with about 10 in 1996, said Cara Morrison, founder of Cogitamus Consulting in Manhattan and the report's author.  There are now more than 1,000 hair care products over all that help eliminate frizz, from John Frieda's Frizz-Ease regimen, which jump-started the market in 1991, to this year's Quiet Calm Curl Control, an organic shea butter, wheatgrass and orange oil-based moisturizing cream to enhance curls while providing style control, by Innersense. There is also Cutler Curling Cream; Citr\u00e9 Shine's Making Waves curl booster; Redken Crystal Curls, a defining shine gel; and None of Your Frizzness, a line of shampoo, conditioner and frizz leave-in cream by Herbal Essence.  Bumble & Bumble developed a silicone-based finishing product called Defrizz for blowing the hair straight in the 1990s, and three years ago added a moisturizing regimen. That product line, Curl Conscious, includes transglutaminase, an enzyme that ''goes into overdrive in heat and humidity,'' Ms. Orpin said.  It's not just anecdotal that curly-haired women have more shampoos, conditioners, serums and balms in their bathrooms. ''According to market research, curly-haired women spend more on their hair than straight-haired women,'' Ms. Breyer said.  Lorraine Massey, co-owner of Devachan, a Manhattan salon that specializes in curly hair, said she had 28,000 new clients in the past year in her two locations looking to set their curls free and defang their frizz.  ''You can take the curl off the girl, but you can't take it out of her,'' said Ms. Massey, who is on a mission to help curly-haired women love and accept their hair. ''You can make it go away for a day, but if it is raining or if you take a shower, that baby is coming right back. The more you mistreat it, the drier and frizzier it becomes and you hate your hair even more, so you stay in a vicious cycle.''  Ms. Massey, who wrote ''Curly Girl'' with Deborah Chiel (Workman, 2002), rails against blow-drying curly hair straight, a process she calls ''blow fry'' and ''glorified laundering.''  ''Frizz is a curl that needs some moisture and direction,'' she said.  Dr. David Orentreich, a dermatologist in Manhattan, said that frizzy hair can benefit more from the use of conditioning products than any other hair type.  ''All of these products aimed at eliminating frizz, reducing unruliness of curly or dry hair, all have the same basic premise: control flyaway, good static control, improve hair feel, improve ease of combing and manageability, detangle, and they may also decrease the color fade,'' Dr. Orentreich said.  But perhaps their biggest impact is to offer women a choice.  ''People want to have options in how their hair looks,'' said Ms. Breyer of Naturallycurly.com. ''One day they might want to wear it straight and one day they might want to wear it curly.''  You hear that, Marcia Brady?  Hair Regimens Fit for the Jungle? Putting Unruly Locks to a Big Test  HOURS before leaving on a 17-day trip to Vietnam and Cambodia over the holidays, I visited the hairdresser.  ''Blow it straight,'' I urged Michelle Collins, a stylist at Paragon Salon and Spa in Greenvale, N.Y., who shares my aversion to frizz. ''It has to last.''  A friend and I had already tested a half-dozen frizz-repellent products. We found two brands -- the Phyto regimen of Phytojoba hydrating shampoo, Phytocitrus Soin vital radiance mask (for color-treated hair), followed by Phytod\u00e9frisant hair relaxing balm; and the L'Anza Strait-Line smoothing shampoo, conditioner and straightening balm regimen -- that made our hair far silkier, lighter and smoother than did John Frieda's Frizz-Ease products when blown straight.  But 24 hours of traveling from New York to Hanoi left my blowout flat and grimy.  I was equipped to go natural. But in muggy central Vietnam, Ouidad Deep Treatment Intensive Conditioner, followed by Ouidad Climate Control heat and humidity gel, as well as generous amounts of both Ouidad pomade and its Shine Glaze Serum, which had worked so well at home, only kept my ringlets soft and defined for a few hours. DevaCurl Set It Free finishing spray spruced things back up, but rinsing my hair with the hotel's generic conditioner revived my unfashionable haystack look.  The situation got even more out of hand in the steamy Cambodian jungle. But switching to the Bumble & Bumble Curl Conscious regimen loosened the tight knot of frizz back into soft curls. At that, even my three sons -- my harshest curl critics -- stopped begging me to buy a hat.  MARCELLE S. FISCHLER  SKIN DEEP  ",

            "text": "  AS sinful pleasures go, breakfast in bed ranks as one of the least wicked -- slothful and slightly gluttonous, but not exactly worthy of ecclesiastical condemnation. Yet people routinely deny themselves this minor indulgence, often for one of two reasons: they either feel guilty about being so lazy, or they fret about food particles falling between their sheets.  There's no quick fix for the guilt-ridden, save for frequent reminders to lighten up and live a little. But the neat freaks can now enjoy a worry-free breakfast in bed thanks to the Buon Appetito, a satin duvet cover outfitted with an elongated cotton bib. When the food arrives, the cover's user pulls its upper flap over his torso and ties it around his neck. Crumbs are thus prevented from secreting themselves within the linens.  The product's designers, Olga Bielawska and Astrid Schildkopf, came up with the idea in late 2005, while attending the Bauhaus-Univerist\u00e4t Weimar in Weimar, Germany. ''We had the idea to make a project about errors, about the everyday problems and little mishaps that happen,'' Ms. Schildkopf said. With sketchbooks in hand, she and Ms. Bielawska sat down and brainstormed over the various accidents that occur in each room of a house.  When the conversation turned to the bedroom, Ms. Schildkopf and Ms. Bielawska first thought of lewd mishaps, which are tough to remedy through product design. But their creative back-and-forth soon turned to another naughty activity. ''Eating in bed is a thing you really should not do, because you get all the crumbs,'' Ms. Schildkopf said. ''We thought, 'O.K., how can we play with that? How can we make a positive product that invites you to do something that you normally should not do?' ''  Inspired by the bibs used by infants and lobster connoisseurs alike, the designers tried sewing a narrow cotton flap onto a bedsheet. Ms. Schildkopf, the designated tester, quickly discovered that the bib needed to be longer and more billowy, because toast detritus can travel surprisingly far. She also played with the size of the straps that secure the cloth to a breakfaster's neck; too big a hole for the neck would leave pajama tops exposed, but too small an aperture would make the bib uncomfortable.  To imbue it with some culinary atmosphere, Ms. Schildkopf and Ms. Bielawska decided to make the bib out of red-and-white-checkered cotton, the traditional tablecloth material for Italian restaurants worldwide. A final flourish was a lace border, which Ms. Schildkopf described as evocative of the hearty, meat-centric breakfasts that a grandmother might make.  The Buon Appetito went on sale last February at a university-run shop. Ms. Schildkopf and Ms. Bielawska graduated soon after and founded a Weimar design studio called Miss Geschick & Lady Lapsus.  The nascent company managed to sell 20 handmade Buon Appetitos through its Web site, Missgeschickladylapsus.de, before deciding to industrialize production late last year.  The first shipment, manufactured by a Bavarian textiles firm, is expected in Weimar next month. The Buon Appetitos will be offered in American twin size and the slightly smaller European single size. Each duvet cover will be accompanied by a pillow cover with a similar red-and-white color scheme; the set will cost 99 euros (about $128) for the European size, and 129 euros (about $168) for the American size.  If there is a drawback to the Buon Appetito, it is that the bib isn't detachable. Splatter yolk or syrup on it, and the whole duvet cover must go into the laundry. Serious neat freaks might have to settle for toast-only breakfasts in bed.  OPENERS: THE GOODS  ",

            "text": "  WINEMAKERS say that today's boxed wines are markedly better than the thin, acidic plonk of yore. And American consumers seem to agree, judging by their growing thirst for merlots and chardonnays encased in cardboard. According to Information Resources, a retail data firm, dollar sales of wine in three-liter boxes tripled from 2004 to 2006.  Yet many drinkers still won't deign to sip wine from a spigot, no matter how many times they're told that the quality has improved. It's the packaging that turns them off, they say. For some, the boxes are hopelessly tacky -- fit more for sorority parties than sophisticated get-togethers. For others, the boxes are too reminiscent of youthful misadventures: legion are the tales of epic hangovers caused by imbibing too much boxed swill.  Patrik Svanberg, a product designer in Stockholm, is among those who previously equated boxed wine with cheap, regrettable excesses; he recalls getting drunk on the stuff during a high-school trip to France. ''But then maybe five years ago, boxed wine started to become really popular in Sweden,'' Mr. Svanberg said.  Indeed, according to the market research company ACNielsen, 65 percent of the wine consumed in Sweden now comes in boxes. (The figure for the United States is around 20 percent.)  Though relatively impressed with the taste of these wines, Mr. Svanberg couldn't quite overcome his aversion to the boxes themselves. ''We went to lots of dinner parties, and there would be this ugly thing, this box of wine,'' he said. ''That made me think about making something beautiful to put on the table.''  In early 2003, Mr. Svanberg began developing his Bag-in-Box Wine Dispenser, a metal contraption that resembles a cross between an Italian coffeemaker and a ''Star Wars'' droid. To use it, a drinker must first open the boxed wine's carton and remove the three-liter plastic pouch inside. The pouch is then placed inside the dispenser and attached to a simple push-button tap.  At first, Mr. Svanberg thought of giving the dispenser a more spartan look -- essentially that of an aluminum box. But he was disappointed in his first prototype, which he found to be boring, not sleek. ''It looked better in my mind than it did in reality,'' he said.  But as he brooded over his failure over breakfast one morning, he found inspiration on his kitchen counter. ''I actually had an orange-juice press in my kitchen,'' he said, ''and I saw that it had very nice curves in the legs.''  After adding similar legs to his dispenser, Mr. Svanberg entered the testing phase, which required buying dozens of boxes of wine. He discovered that while the interior bags were more or less of uniform size, winemakers used about 10 different types of outflow holes. Months of tweaking were required to ensure that the dispenser's tap could accommodate every version.  A longtime client of Mr. Svanberg's, the P.O.M. housewares company of Stockholm, started manufacturing the dispenser in late 2003. It is now available from the online Dutch design shop POAA.nl, and is priced at 39 euros, or about $50.  Mr. Svanberg says a few customers have complained about the length of the dispenser's legs, contending that they're not high enough to allow for a fully upright glass to be placed underneath. He counters that longer legs would make the dispenser look ungainly, and that a drinker can compensate by tilting the glass while pressing the tap.  Drinkers who want to recreate the low-brow boxed-wine experiences of their youth, however, can still go for the method preferred by soused tailgaters: bring the dispenser to the edge of a table, and place one's mouth directly under the spout.  Not classy by any means, but certainly effective.  OPENERS: THE GOODS  ",

Her latest venture is Altru, a home fragrance brand that benefits her charity, the In a Perfect World Foundation, which helps underprivileged children.  Her secret to looking pulled together in any situation? A closet full of blazers. ''I own at least 12 Gucci suits,'' said Ms. Testolini Nelson, who is 5-foot-3. She also favors Dolce & Gabbana and Stella McCartney, whose designs, she said, ''are powerful and feminine at the same time.''  She strives for that balance in work and wardrobe. ''I love warm jewel tones, and I wear four-inch heels almost every day,'' said Ms. Testolini Nelson, who is married to Prince. Here, she's in a Gucci leather blazer, a Tracy Feith top, AG Adriano Goldschmied jeans and Dsquared shoes; the bag is by Kooba.  A frenetic schedule (a Toronto native, she logged 36 flights on Air Canada alone last year) has forced her to make some style concessions. ''I wear ankle booties because they're easy to slip off for the X-ray machines,'' she said. Recently, Ms. Testolini Nelson bought her first pair of flats, by Tory Burch. Last week, just before flying to the Sundance Film Festival, where she presented her documentary in progress, ''In a Perfect World  Listen to the Children,'' she snapped up two Miss Sixty puffy coats. ''I got one in black and one in olive green.''  JENNIFER TUNG  PULSE: WHAT I'M WEARING NOW  ",

            "text": "  JAMES KAPLAN, the chief executive of Tai Ping, a high-end carpet company based in Hong Kong, knew exactly what he didn't want when he began to think of a United States headquarters and flagship showroom. There would be no piles of smelly rugs on the floor and no pushy sales representatives, and the space wouldn't be in a building with other rug wholesalers. When architects and designers stepped into the new showroom, they might not know immediately what was for sale, but they would know it was luxurious.  ''We designed the space to look like it could be a museum or an art gallery or a high-end clothing store,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''We wanted people to walk in and understand nothing other than that it was a luxury brand environment.''  The space also has the feel of an artist's atelier, where design professionals can create customized rugs in wool, silk, linen and other premium fibers like cashmere. Wholesale custom orders make up a majority of Tai Ping's business around the globe.  ''It had to feel closer to a design studio than a warehouse,'' said Matthew Baird of Matthew Baird Design, the architectural firm in Manhattan that was responsible for the project.  According to Mr. Baird, who had never designed a showroom before, this 12,500-square-foot, J-shaped space blends Tai Ping's Chinese heritage with references to its New York location, on the fourth floor of a six-story building at 860 Broadway at 17th Street. The landmarked building, circa 1880, has views of Union Square and was home to Andy Warhol's Factory in the mid-1970s. Tai Ping's space was previously occupied by a dot-com business.  The design also had to help establish Tai Ping in the United States as a luxury brand exported from China. (Another is the fashion label Shanghai Tang.)  The design concept was inspired partly by Chinese courtyard houses that have a series of layers, according to Mr. Baird, who studied them extensively in preparation for the project. Rooms become more private as you pass across each threshold from one to the next. At Tai Ping, the transition from room to room is made softer by glass partitions, some frosted or opaque, that temper light and shadows and naturally slow the pace of movement, Mr. Baird said.  The rug company's first, most public layer is the reception area. Using dark wood floors and paneling, it is filled with the most literal Chinese references. A hollow brick from the Han dynasty sits in a niche opposite the elevator; tea canisters with cuneiform characters line one wall of a small, glassed-in kitchen carved out of the Broadway side of the room. The company logo, designed by the Wallpaper magazine founder Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9, is discreetly etched in the glass partition that separates the kitchen and a small main waiting area.  More cuneiform is chalked onto small blackboards on an opposite wall, while a strategically placed ming tree redirects energy according to traditional feng shui principles. (Those principles also dictated that Chinese coins be buried under the floor at the entrance.) A feng shui master, R. D. Chin, consulted on Mr. Baird's design and blessed the project when the first phase, the showroom area and some executive offices, was completed in the fall of 2005. That was the same year that Tai Ping, a 50-year-old business, entered the United States market. The final phase of the project, executed by the Alcon Builders Group, will be completed early this year.  An ebonized wooden double door, ornamented with a traditional Chinese moon motif in tombasil (white bronze), opens onto the main showroom, where Mr. Baird let the New York references speak for themselves. Light from six large windows highlights the original late 19th-century architectural features, like 12 1/2-foot exposed brick vaulted ceilings, hardwood floors, wooden baseboards, cast-iron radiators and elegant, narrow fluted columns. The proximity to Union Square adds to the sense of place, according to Mr. Baird, whose 10-person firm works on a mix of commercial and residential projects.  ''The way the showroom focuses on those exquisite views is what brings New York into it,'' he said.  Against one exposed brick wall, a white, late-18th-century Swedish settee adds a decorative flourish to a rather stark, contemporary room dominated by the geometry of white columns, a wall of white built-in display units designed by Mr. Baird to hold colorful carpet samples, and workstations in clear and white curved acrylic that Mr. Baird also designed for the showroom. The furniture is on casters to allow for more flexibility; samples of tufted wool in 500 different colors pop out of the ''pom bar,'' or sample box, which is set into the top of some of the workstations so designers can work with them as easily as possible.  Piles of rugs are conspicuously absent. In their place, one or two colorful styles are on the dark-stained hardwood floor. A single carpet hanging against the far wall gives the room the aura of an art gallery; the carpet is suspended from a system of cables designed to hold scenery for theatrical stage sets -- another New York reference.  Multiple rugs can be suspended on and slid along five, 70-foot-long tracks. The same tracks extend behind glass walls in two conference rooms, where rugs can be changed or moved at will to suit a particular client's taste, or just to refresh the color scheme. They stand in contrast to the rooms' midcentury modern furniture (designs by Eero Saarinen and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe). And in the smaller of two conference rooms, the rugs are the only d\u00e9cor.  The larger conference room is divided from the showroom by a wall of large colorful thread spindles arranged between two panels of glass, clear on the showroom side and translucent on the conference side. The afternoon sun creates an unusual abstract tableau of light and color.  Administration, sales and a storeroom occupy the far end of the offices, the last phase to be completed. Open-plan cubicles are being configured to accommodate a doubling of the sales staff over the next few years. Currently, 35 people work in the headquarters.  The conference rooms are part of a grouping of glass offices that include that of Mr. Kaplan, the chief executive. Mr. Baird said he chose the glass partitions to reinforce the contrast of contemporary materials, shapes and furnishings with the traditional brick and cast iron of the office's shell.  A line of about a dozen fluted white columns runs parallel to the glass screen along one side. The effect is the illusion of more space in a long, narrow leg of the layout while slowing the move from one layer to the next, in the spirit of the Chinese courtyard houses. Bright, patterned Tai Ping rugs in each office are a bold statement among the subtle neutral colors of the midcentury modern furnishings. Yet they maintain a supporting role in a design that Mr. Kaplan calls the ''anti-showroom.''  ''The product was almost secondary to the aesthetic of the showroom,'' he said.

            "text": "  THE Warhol era's 15 minutes continue at the 205 Club, a new Lower East Side spot done up in the style of the Factory. Like that hangout, the interior of 205 is silver, a mix of paint and aluminum foil.  The grottolike space downstairs is decorated with neatly printed graffiti, and the furniture on both floors -- tables covered in decoupage or made out of clocks -- is stylishly kitschy. Even the upholstery on the banquettes was intentionally torn to match the less-ironically distressed Factory. As a crowning meta-touch, instead of Warhol's famous prints of Marilyn Monroe, there are large photos of Paris Hilton.  Of course, the connection may be lost on people whose knowledge of the Factory era begins and ends with Sienna Miller as Edie Sedgwick.  ''I don't know if it's Warhol-esque, but it's a nice atmosphere,'' Barnett Citron, 24, said last weekend. ''You can dance like a villain here.''  Well, Mr. Citron could. A group of his friends -- men and women, ''good looking people,'' he noted -- had been turned away. Since it replaced 6s and 8s, a not-so-sleek rock 'n' roll bar in the same location a few months ago, 205 has found a following. It's one of the few downtown clubs with a cabaret license, which means those fiendish dance parties are perfectly legal.  Backed by the night life maven Serge Becker (who came up with the Factory theme and is also behind the night spots La Esquina and the Box) and the skateboard guru known as A-Ron (whose shop, aNYthing, is nearby), 205 has pedigree but comparatively little pomp. The bar takes pleasure in poking fun at its brethren on club row in Chelsea (the only specialty cocktail is the 27th Street, an $18 cosmopolitan), a stance appreciated by the modish, artsy crowd that treats 205 like a hangout.  ''The club scene has gotten really boring in New York,'' said Sophia Reznikas, an artist who grew up in the neighborhood. The 205 Club, she said, is ''a better playground for younger people who are trying to make something of themselves, not just buy bottle service.''  Or as Tommy Bones, a DJ who stopped by, put it, ''there's some vibe left.'' And plenty of it. Miguel Strong, a skinny blond musician with a Warholian haircut and a raccoon tail hanging from his back pocket, was twisting and cantering to a Run-D.M.C. song.  ''I'm an enthusiast and I express myself sensually and I can barely hold myself in,'' he said. ''I can tell that there's an element of the pulse, of neurotic, erotic perfection.''  205 Club  205 Chrystie Street (at Stanton Street), (212) 477-6688.  GETTING IN -- At doorman's discretion.

            "text": "  In the fall of 2004, Gap put on a splashy ad campaign called, ''How do you wear it?'' with Lenny Kravtiz and Sarah Jessica Parker. It featured the pair dancing in customized Gap jeans -- his with metal studs down the seam; hers with a waist-to-cuff velvet ribbon.  It was just the kind of envelope-pushing fashion Gap needed to compete with popular new designer-inspired denim brands like Diesel, Rock & Republic and Seven for All Mankind.  But there was a catch: the bedazzled jeans, which Gap called a ''celebration of personal style,'' could not be found at its stores.  Consumers had to buy a pair of basic, unembellished jeans at the store and customize them at a special training sessions held at some Gaps, or take a trip to Home Depot and Jo-Ann Fabrics and figure it out themselves.  The marketing tease is a small case study in what has ailed Gap, which ousted its chief executive, Paul S. Pressler, this week after years of dismal performance at its Gap and Old Navy divisions.  At a time when small, narrowly focused fashion brands -- Coach, Juicy Couture, Tahari, Laundry -- have become ascendant in American retailing, Gap has served up a steady diet of simple, unobjectionable casual clothing designed to appeal to everyone.  How do they wear it, as the ads asked? Increasingly, they just do not.  In an era of niches, when exclusion is as vital as inclusion, Gap has become an anachronism: a single chain, selling only its own brand, with one point of view, chasing shoppers from birth to death.  ''If you stand for everything in fashion today, you stand for nothing,'' said Paul R. Charron, the former chief executive of Liz Claiborne, who is credited with revitalizing the clothing company by purchasing fast-growing brands like Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand.  ''Brands like the Gap, brands broadly available,'' Mr. Charron said, ''have a special challenge to be relevant in a period when focus and exclusivity are so important.''  Indeed, consumers are abandoning the chain in staggering numbers. Sales at stores open at least a year, a standard measure of a retailer's health, have fallen or remained stagnant for 28 of the last 30 months.  And the declines have not been small. Sales fell 8 percent in December and November and 7 percent in October -- the most crucial months of the year. The word ''disappointing'' became a common refrain in every monthly news release explaining Gap's performance.  Gap operates three divisions: Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic. All three have struggled, but only Banana Republic is on the rebound.  Niche brands, by contrast, have done so well that they have even reversed the fortunes of the American department store. In the last year, the performance of department stores like Nordstrom and Macy's has quietly overtaken that of specialty clothing retailers like Gap.  The reason? ''Consumers want brands, and we are all about brands,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, chief executive of Saks Inc., whose sales have improved sharply in the last year on the strength of designer labels like Tahari and Theory.  ''It's very hard for the specialty clothing stores to keep themselves cutting-edge and fresh,'' Mr. Sadove said. ''There is a lot of sameness.''  Or walk into the handful of specialty clothing chains like Abercrombie & Fitch, American Apparel and Anthropologie, stores that, like Gap, design their own clothing but have managed to thrive by appealing to small slivers of the public.  Those stores' environments leave no doubt who their shopper is supposed to be -- vintage-loving, 30-something urban women (at Anthropologie); trend-obsessed, preppy teenagers (at Abercrombie & Fitch); and socially conscious hipsters in their 20s and 30s (at American Apparel.)  Abercrombie & Fitch is openly hostile to what it considers the wrong customer -- typically anyone over 30 -- warding them off with booming music, dark shades on the front windows and teenage employees standing out front.  Gap has veered to the other extreme, putting out a welcome mat to nearly everyone, with well-lighted, sparsely decorated stores and ageless fashions.  ''The definition of a specialty store is focus,'' said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, a national retail consulting firm and investment bank.  Gap does not have that focus, Mr. Davidowitz said. And in trying to meet the needs of infants, teenagers, and even the elderly, its designers play it safe, season after season. ''The merchandise is booooooring,'' Mr. Davidowitz added. ''Too basic.''  Patricia Longo, a 36-year-old makeup artist who lives in Manhattan, is the kind of style-obsessed shopper who has little use for Gap these days. She wears Ugg boots, a Betsey Johnson bag, a Pepe Jeans jacket and a cotton taupe Ella Moss dress.  ''They don't have the new fads,'' she said of Gap. ''When I look for something new and young and trendy, Gap is not coming to my head.''  And it is not that she buys only designer clothes. Ms. Longo covets designer knockoffs, which is why she shops at H&M, the Swedish retailer known for its fresh-from-the-runway fashions.  So what is Gap to do?  A Gap spokesman, Greg Rossiter, said the company was ''totally committed to returning these brands to the leadership they enjoyed for so many years.''  For that to happen, retail analysts said, the chain could start by shrinking, to give its clothes the kind of cachet that Gap had decades ago, before it operated 1,295 stores (not to mention hundreds more Banana Republic and Old Navy stores, which bring the total to more than 3,000). Abercrombie & Fitch, for example, has 361 stores for its flagship brand.  Next, analysts said, it could experiment with brands, as several new specialty clothing stores have started to do. When Martin & Osa, a clothing store aimed at people in their 30s created by American Eagle Outfitters, opened in 2006, it carried its own store brand as well as bags from North Face, sunglasses from Ray-Ban and track jackets from Adidas.  Gap used to carry Levi's jeans but stopped in 1991. Today, it stocks a single outside brand, Converse sneakers.  Finally, Gap could focus on a narrow group of consumers, and tailor clothing to meet their needs -- a prospect that would probably require the chain to become much smaller. ''They have to pick out a demographic and go after it with a maniacal focus, to the exclusion of anyone else,'' said Bob Buchanan, an analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons.  ''If there is one thing you cannot be in the middle of the mall anymore, it is all things to all people,'' he added. ''And that is what Gap has been trying to do.''  ",

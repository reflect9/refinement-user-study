            "text": "  WHO -- Wyndi Gundrum-Cooper, 47, a real estate agent from Ocean Isle Beach, N.C.  WHAT -- Studio condominium  WHERE -- Charleston, S.C.  I've been visiting Charleston for 15 years, I even honeymooned here, and it's a place where I've always wanted to own a home. I looked for years, but of course the closer I got to the city center, the higher the cost. I discovered this little gem about a year ago. It's 320 square feet with a 100-square-foot courtyard. When I bought it, it needed work. I redid the bathroom, since the only thing holding it up was the tile, and turned the full kitchen into a kitchenette.  The biggest thing in the apartment is the fireplace. It's 84 inches, while the kitchenette is only 54 inches across. But a big fireplace is part of the historic nature of this 200-year-old building. It's only two rooms but proved to be the hardest two rooms I've ever had to decorate. Though it's the smallest unit in the building, I wouldn't think about giving up my courtyard for a bigger space.  I live at the beach, so when I want to get away, I come here. We're two and a half hours away and make it here about twice a month. Generally my husband, Ron Cooper, and I will arrive late on a Friday night. We park the car out front and don't move it again until we leave at the end of the weekend. The condo is right on Queen Street, so we can walk to shopping on King Street and to restaurants. Charleston has a growing gallery district, and we are right in the heart of it. But when I first arrive, I just love to spend time in our home.  I never say I have a place in Charleston. I don't want people to think that I have a mansion in the city or one of the newer, grand apartments, so instead, I always say that I have ''a space'' in Charleston.

Telluride is home to one of the very first hydroelectric power plants, and this building used to belong to the Telluride Power Company. When you walk in the front door, there's a little slot. It says ''Bills.'' Our windows look out on the gondola station and mountains. Nothing will get built there.  We live in Las Vegas, but I'd been coming to Telluride for years. When our daughter was born, I began trying to convince Bree we could move here permanently and live happily ever after. That fell on deaf ears. But when my half-brother expressed interest in starting a business, and told us his daughter, Berkeley, was attending aesthetician school, Bree and I got to thinking about trying it out, since Berkeley could run the shop. Our salon is about 300 square feet and the rest of the commercial space is a real estate office.  Living in a commercial building can be funky. The bathroom, for example, has two doors, one that was designed as a public entrance for the community, and one that was for the office workers. You can have a bath in there during business hours, but you have to be very careful.  We didn't want to compromise the integrity of the building, so we didn't put in a kitchen. We have a microwave and a little fridge for necessities, but we mostly go out to eat. That's fine with us. The restaurants here are great, and Berkeley's husband runs two of the nearby gyro carts, so we're about 100 feet from the best sandwiches in town.

            "text": "  PEOPLE interested in buying brownstones or town houses should not assume that all of the bargains are gone. Brokers say there are still properties in New York City that cost less than $1 million, but only if buyers are willing to venture into often overlooked neighborhoods and tolerate extensive renovations.  ''You can still get a lovely brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant for well under $1 million,'' said William S. Ross, executive director of sales for Halstead Property in Brooklyn. ''The market begins around $650,000 to $700,000 for a real four-story brownstone.''  Because brownstones in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights have been less appealing to renovators than those in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope and Carroll Gardens, many still have original details, Mr. Ross said. These often include fireplace mantels, tall parlor windows and high ceilings.  Mr. Ross, who owns a brownstone in Cobble Hill, warns buyers to invest upfront in advisers -- like engineers knowledgeable about brownstones -- who can identify all of the costly problems that inevitably arise. If a brownstone in a historic district needs a new facade, for instance, that alone can cost $100,000, he said. Restoration work can also be pricey -- restoring moldings in a living room can cost $40,000.  But buyers say that these changes can be worth the hassle. In 2002, Florence Clutch, now a vice president at Halstead, bought a brownstone in Crown Heights for about $350,000. She spent about $150,000 in renovations like updating the electricity and replacing the water main, to increase water pressure. Now she rents out three floors and believes she could sell her property for three times the purchase price. Ms. Clutch says that 8 to 10 brownstones in Crown Heights typically come up for sale each year.  There are always houses on the market requiring renovation. One of Ms. Clutch's listings, a two-family town home at 1318 Prospect Place in Park Slope offered at $559,000, will require ''tons'' of investment from a buyer, in cosmetic renovations and in dealing with current tenants, she said.  A town house for sale in Bedford-Stuyvesant, at 177 Nostrand Avenue, was recently reduced in price to $620,000 from $640,000. The broker, Malik Mitchell, who is an executive vice president for Century 21 NY Metro, estimated that the buyer would have to spend about $40,000 to make the walls and floors presentable.  A buyer would also have to deal with the city bureaucracy to get the home's classification changed to a three-family from the current two-family, if he or she wanted to legally rent out the already renovated basement apartment.  While most empty shells of brownstones in Harlem fetch more than $1 million, Prudential Douglas Elliman is selling a brownstone at 237 West 131st Street for $895,000. Todd Stevens, the agent representing the seller, says its situation across from public housing might make it attractive to an investor for converting into studios.  Brokers say buyers willing to wait for deals on town houses might look in areas like Sunnyside in Queens and Mott Haven in the Bronx. Carmela Massimo, an associate broker with Welcome Home Real Estate, estimates that a town house comes on the market in Sunnyside about every six months. Buyers willing to take on renovation projects typically pay about $600,000 for one-family homes and $800,000 for two-family homes, she said.  The enclave of 100-year-old town homes in Mott Haven also offers properties costing about $600,000 to $750,000 when they come to market. Sasha Catus, president of Catus Properties, is listing a 107-year-old two-family town house at 304 Alexander Avenue for $749,000. He says that prices for these town houses have doubled in the last two to three years because of the steep increases in nearby Harlem. ''In Brooklyn and Harlem,'' Mr. Catus said, ''you have several thousand town houses, whereas in the South Bronx you have a fraction of that. The commodity itself is rare.''  ",

            "text": "  This cabin is less than 10 minutes from our house in Madison and it's only about 700 square feet. But it's right on the lake, and it has a detached garage. That was the real attraction for me, because up until then, I'd been trying to build a Renegade ice yacht in my basement. This required punching a hole in the wall, something that wasn't very pleasing to my wife. This garage, on the other had, is already in borderline tear-down condition, so, you know, knocking out holes isn't that big a deal.  I must have been 11 or 12 years old the first time I saw an ice boat. It was one of those years with beautiful black ice on the lake. I was skating with a group of friends, and this guy sailed by and offered to tow us across the lake. I knew I had to have one.  So, right after college, I started building and sailing. From the beginning, I had great help from the guys at the Four Lakes Ice Yacht Club. It's been around for about 80 years, and the older guys have been real mentors to me. Nothing gets me out of bed like checking on the work I did on a boat the day before. I just grab a cup of coffee and go straight to the garage to take a look.  Ice boating is similar to sailing, but unlike regular sailing, the friction is minimal, you can sail upward of five times the speed of wind. Therein lies the thrill. Sitting low, so close to the ice, it feels like you're going 100 miles an hour. For years, I was able to lie about things like that, but now with global positioning systems, I know it's more like 60.

            "text": "  The only thing stretching across the entrance to the Bay Front Estates at Mill Basin last week, over a mud-and-gravel road split by a trench for the new water and sewer pipes, was a string of multicolored flags, sagging from a pair of long two-by-fours driven into the raw ground.  But while the development, in southeastern Brooklyn, is still unfinished and the lavish single-family houses inside have only begun to sell, there is a sign that something unusual is afoot. On either side of the entrance, a few feet from each of the ersatz flagpoles, are little guard huts. Once the road is done, the people in the huts will control access to that rarest of New York development phenomena: a gated community.  ''Just about everyone in Florida lives in one now, and Las Vegas, but they are kind of rare in our area,'' said the development's exclusive broker, Tony vanderBeek of Coldwell Banker Mid Plaza Real Estate.  True, New York City has a small number of long-established gated communities, like Sea Gate in Brooklyn and Breezy Point in Queens. But the Bay Front Estates is new, and at least one more is on the way, in Brooklyn's Bergen Beach. That fenced-off complex is called Mill Harbor Condominiums, and according to its Web site, it will offer its residents ''suburban lifestyle close to Manhattan.''  Surprisingly enough, a suburban way of life is just what many people are after, said Dorothy Turano, district manager of Community Board 18, which includes Bergen Beach and Mill Basin.  On the Bay Front Estates site, the board pushed for low-density housing during a tortuous, decade-long rezoning process that saw the rise and fall of multiple development proposals for the land, a fallow stretch across the water from Kings Plaza Mall. In the end, Ms. Turano said, the board was thrilled with the plan by the Queens-based developer H & H Builders for a gated, strictly residential community.  ''We don't have mixed uses here, and we don't want them,'' she said. ''We don't think you should mix commercial and residential. It doesn't work, not in Brooklyn. The boroughs, they're more suburban and we want to keep it suburban.''  State Senator Carl Kruger, who represents the neighborhood, said he was impressed by Bay Front Estates, with its meandering road and decorative streetlights, and the flexibility it will give a future homeowners' association to determine its own level of security.  ''It's exactly what we'd like to be able to replicate on undeveloped parcels throughout the community,'' he said.  In the section of Mill Basin near the site, the houses are similar to, if smaller than, the ones inside where the gate will be. The neighboring houses are brick on the first floor, with white siding or shingles above. The homes at Bay Front Estates have stucco. The neighboring homes are detached from one another, with yards, driveways and even garages.  The streets were largely quiet on a recent afternoon, but comments by the few residents who were out suggested that the new estates were no big deal.  ''I don't think anything is really a big deal around here,'' 23-year-old Daniel Bykhovsky, who was walking to the bus, said wryly.  So far, Mr. vanderBeek said, four of the new houses have been sold. Twenty others have been built, and 10 lots on the water are set aside for custom houses. The asking prices for the existing houses begin at $1.35 million.  The gate that will be installed at the entrance, he said, is less about safety than about creating a sense of distinctness for the homes within: five-bedroom houses with marble bathrooms. They are, Mr. vanderBeek said, ''the nicest houses in the area.''  Construction at the Mill Harbor Condominiums is scheduled to continue until the end of the year, but new owners are to begin moving in next month. Sean Lavin, one of the partners in Parkmore Development, which is building the complex, said the gate would distinguish the walkable, garden-style units from the detached one- and two-family homes nearby.  ''It's not so much that you're preventing people from getting in there,'' Mr. Lavin said. ''I think people liked the idea of added security. They didn't feel the necessity to have it, but it's similar to being in a doorman building, where it adds a sense of exclusivity.''

            "text": "  JOURNAL SQUARE -- which was once the centerpiece of vibrant downtown -- slouched into seediness after the mass defection of middle-class families to the suburbs more than a half-century ago.  It has been waiting ever since for a comeback, at least in the view of those who knew it when. And that group would certainly include Lowell Harwood, 77, who as a boy helped out at a busy parking lot on Journal Square, and jostled through crowds to get to the movies at one of three grand theaters there.  Now Mr. Harwood, the managing partner of his family's third-generation firm, Harwood Properties, is engineering the hoped-for comeback.  Last month, city officials unanimously approved Harwood Properties' plan to revitalize an entire city block that had fallen into decrepitude and gone on to fast-food heaven. (McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and a small Mexican restaurant occupy three prominent storefronts where a hotel, a bakery and an old-style cafeteria once thrived.)  Two residential skyscrapers would anchor the ''new'' block with more than 1,000 units, a retail center, five floors of parking, a rooftop fitness center -- and even a rooftop dog run.  ''We're going to bring it back,'' Mr. Harwood said. From his company's eighth-floor office in the building next to The Jersey Journal, the newspaper for which the square is named, he looked down at the 1.5-acre site across the street, Journal Square Plaza.  ''All the excitement,'' he added. ''The people on the streets. It will be a renaissance like in New York City neighborhoods, in Harlem and other places you would have never thought people would be dying to move into again.''  Right now, parts of the Journal Square plan are in flux -- especially the issue of whether to build two towers right away, or build one at a time, and the question of condominiums versus rentals.  ''We're leaning toward building the bigger tower first -- 545 feet and 51 stories,'' Mr. Harwood said. ''We're leaning toward more rentals than condos, given the market right now -- but we're just leaning, not decided, because the market changes all the time.''  Scott Harwood, Mr. Harwood's nephew, who is a partner in the company, said the final decision about condos or rentals might not come until the start of construction later this year. The company is working to persuade various current tenants in several buildings -- purchased in 2005 from a developer whose rehab plans had fizzled -- to relocate.  Besides the fast-food restaurants, there are a number of dollar stores and check-cashing joints. The Harwoods, though, are looking for more upscale shops for the two floors of retailing in their new complex. ''We would also like to get a grocery store in the building,'' the senior Mr. Harwood said.  They see the future Journal Square as an urban neighborhood, populated by young professionals, many commuting to Wall Street and Midtown.  The residential towers will consist mostly of one-bedroom units, with some studios and two-bedrooms, Lowell Harwood said.  Neither purchase prices nor rental rates have been determined yet, he said. But he added that he expected a typical one-bedroom to rent for roughly $2,000 a month.  Each unit will have a washer-dryer and hardwood floors. There will be ample parking in the building -- 674 spaces, to be built on floors above the retail level but below the residential towers. And most apartments will have far-reaching views taking in the Statue of Liberty, the Hudson River and some part of the Manhattan skyline, Mr. Harwell said.  The Harwood site is adjacent to the Journal Square Transportation Center, where commuter bus lines operate, and an adjoining PATH train station. The train ride is 12 minutes to the World Trade Center and 20 minutes to Penn Station.  The site also abuts the four-story Hudson Community College building on Sip Avenue.  Journal Square was once home to three highly ornate movie palaces -- the Loew's Theater, the Stanley Theater and the State Theater -- all within two or three blocks of the redevelopment site.  Four years ago, the State Theater was demolished and a new 12-story, 130-unit apartment building rose on the site -- the first new structure at Journal Square in more than 20 years. Harwood Properties was one of a group of local developers that were partners on the project.  ''The one-bedroom units there were snapped up, and today the building is fully leased,'' Mr. Harwood said, ''which is why we are going to put predominantly one-bedroom units in this development.''  The Journal Square redevelopment effort started almost a decade before the State Theater project, with the busy PATH station as the catalyst. In 1999, a pedestrian area was created to set the area off, featuring fountains, old-fashioned lampposts and a statue of Jackie Robinson, who made his debut as the first black player in professional baseball in a game at Jersey City's old Roosevelt Stadium in 1946.  The Harwood family business began in Manhattan, in the 1920s, when Lowell's grandparents, Wolfe and Sarah Harwood, bought a trolley car garage and transformed it into an automobile garage.  The business went on to acquire 35 New York City parking lots, then lost them all during the Depression.  In 1936 Lowell's mother, Laura, decided to rent a parking lot in Jersey City -- the one where Lowell worked as a boy -- and the Harwoods went on to become deeply entrenched in Jersey City real estate and development.  Today, Mr. Harwood runs his business with Scott and another nephew, Brett Harwood. He has built a number of large commercial and residential buildings in New York City, Boston and Philadelphia.  In addition to the Journal Square project, he and a partner are working on plans to build a mixed-use residential building at the southwest corner of 44th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.  ",

            "text": "  SOMETIMES, developers and architects say, the biggest design problem with a new Manhattan residential building is figuring out how it will fit onto its lot. Two luxury condominiums, one planned for East 51st Street and the other for East 13th, are currently presenting a challenge.  The 21-story condo that will rise at 211 East 51st Street, between Second and Third Avenues, is set to contain 72 units, ranging from studios to three-bedrooms. Pricing hasn't been set yet, because the building is under contract. Uned Associates, the current owner, based in Manhattan, is selling to Allied Properties of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The closing is scheduled for this week, said Tim Ziss, Allied's principal.  At first, Mr. Ziss had planned to demolish the 15-story condo currently on the site, leaving only its metal beams, concrete floors and foundation, and use those elements as the groundwork for something larger, thereby creating the maximum number of apartments permitted at the site.  But this plan was hamstrung by the fact that the property straddles a commercial zone and a residential zone, each with different building height requirements.  A potentially lopsided roofline wasn't what worried Mr. Ziss. It was the fact that height caps on the residential eastern half of the building would severely curtail how many units he could create.  ''It was extremely complicated,'' he said. ''Even the zoning experts had a hard time tweaking this one.''  The solution, proposed by the architect David Mandl, was to add medical offices to the building's second and third floors. By law, if commercial tenants serve some kind of public benefit, as doctors do, the building can grow taller -- in this case, on the commercial side. Thus, more square footage can be wrung from the project.  ''I've been practicing under my own shingle since 1980, and this is one of the more exotic zoning situations I've dealt with,'' Mr. Mandl said. ''But I think it will turn out to be an elegant project.''  For the A Building, a luxury condo at 425 East 13th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A, the hitch came in the form of an unusual T-shaped lot that extends the width of a block -- so that the T's base fronts on 14th Street.  The size may seem advantageous, leaving plenty of room for extra apartments. But according to John Cetra, the architect, zoning dictates that any new structures be massed along the lot's edges, so that an unbroken line of buildings faces the sidewalk.  So the building is divided in two. The East 13th Street portion, with 150 feet of frontage, will have 77 units, and the East 14th Street side, with 25 feet of frontage, will have 7 units. Prices range from $600,000 to $2.5 million, and 35 percent of the units have sold, said Robert Kaliner, president of the Ascend Group, a Manhattan-based developer.  To avoid leaving a potentially unattractive doughnut hole of unused space in the lot's center, Mr. Cetra decided to pack it with trees and grasses, creating a courtyard that complements the 5,000-square-foot roof deck, which will have similar landscaping and a 50-foot pool.  Another snag: East 13th Street sits at a slightly lower elevation than East 14th, which means that the glass walkway traversing the courtyard to connect the building's two areas must slope down, Mr. Cetra said.  ''Organizing the lower floors was sort of a puzzle,'' he added, explaining that he had never worked on a lot like this before, or on a block-through project. ''It added a lot of drama.''

            "text": "  MONTAUK, the hamlet on the end of Long Island's South Fork, has been a rustic un-Hampton summer destination for more than 50 years. But two new projects suggest that Montauk may be heading for year-round status, and the recent sale of a former celebrity retreat has also put a spotlight on the hamlet.  A new condop -- a co-op complex with condominium-style rules -- is under construction in Montauk on the site of the Panoramic View Hotel on Old Montauk Highway. The property, still operating as a hotel, has more than 1,000 feet of sandy beach on the Atlantic Ocean. The condop is a complete renovation of the hotel.  The developer, Distinctive Ventures, hopes to attract young Manhattan families who want a year-round getaway, but not the bustle and hype of East Hampton and Southampton, according to Adam Manson, a company spokesman.  When completed, the 75-unit complex, to be called Panoramic Villas, will have a full-service concierge, an outdoor heated pool and a fitness center. A mixture of two-, three- and four-bedroom duplexes and some triplexes, ranging in size from 2,000 to 4,000 square feet, is planned. If buyers don't have time to decorate, Mr. Manson said, they can choose from a variety of furniture packages and accessories, including ''everything from table cutlery to napkins in the kitchen ready to use.''  The units, which will start at $1.5 million, will also have oak floors, hot tubs and flat-panel televisions, and granite counters and expensive appliances, Mr. Manson added.  Buyers will purchase shares in the complex, but there are no board approvals, and owners can sublet the units anytime, Mr. Manson said.  Distinctive Ventures plans to start selling the first 27 units of the project this spring, and the units will be ready by fall, Mr. Manson said.  The company believes that wealthier second-home buyers who want year-round services are heading for Montauk. Clues came from the company's research of Montauk's rental market, Mr. Manson said.  ''A lot of rentals in the last few seasons were longer term,'' Mr. Manson said. ''People want to own out there, but there's very little that is brand new.''  Former Warhol Retreat Is Sold For $27 Million  When the pop artist Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey, his manager and film collaborator, bought a 20-acre estate on the ocean in Montauk in 1971 for $225,000, they thought it was a good investment. That's what Mr. Morrissey said last September when the remaining 5.6 acres was on the market for $40 million.  Perhaps that overestimated price how good an investment it was. Earlier this month, Millard S. Drexler, chief executive of the clothing company J. Crew, bought the estate for much less: $27 million, according to Paul Brennan of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who handled the sale.  (The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts donated the other 15 acres to the Nature Conservancy after the artist's death in 1987. The conservancy created the Andy Warhol Preserve in 1993.)  The sold property, called Eothen, ancient Greek for ''at first light,'' sits in a valley among high cliffs in an area known as the Montauk moorlands. Mr. Morrissey listed it with several different real estate firms over the last five years, originally asking $50 million.  Eothen includes a compound of five Colonial Revival-style houses, a horse stable and a three-car garage. All of the houses have spectacular views of the Atlantic Ocean.  Mr. Drexler scouted Eothen for a friend who was interested, Mr. Brennan said, but then bought it himself when the friend passed on it. ''He said, 'It's like a painting,' a very unique property,'' Mr. Brennan said.  The five homes, with 15 bedrooms in all, were built in 1931 for the Church family, descendants of a founder of the Church & Dwight Company, makers of Arm & Hammer baking soda. Seven of the bedrooms are in the main house, a rustic wood-paneled structure with blue shuttered windows and a great room with two fireplaces, exposed beams and a vaulted ceiling.  ''I would say he has very good taste'' to buy the estate, said Tina Fredericks, the East Hampton broker who sold Mr. Morrissey and Warhol the estate in 1971. As for the price, $40 million ''always seemed rather high,'' Ms. Fredericks said.  A Hotel Project Recalls A '20s Developer's Dream  A developer is renovating the 1929 Shepherd's Neck Inn, a 65-room Montauk hotel, and plans to convert it into a year-round ''resort hotel'' called Sol\u00e9 East. (Sole is Italian for ''sun,'' although the Italians don't use an accent mark for the noun.)  The hotel will have 60 rooms on 2.5 landscaped acres when it opens in the spring, according to Tom Feeley, an owner of the development firm Wavestone Properties. Wavestone has also bought the Shepherd's Beach hotel nearby and an adjacent five acres of vacant land, where the zoning was recently changed to permit residential development.  Wavestone has built condominiums and rental buildings in Jersey City and Hoboken, N.J., but this is its first project on Long Island.  Sol\u00e9 East will be one of two branded hotels, Mr. Feeley said. The first, called Sol\u00e9 on the Ocean, is a condominium hotel in Sunny Isles, Fla., which offers owners hotel-like services, including a concierge and housekeeping, and the ability to rent out their units as hotel rooms.  The look and feel of the Montauk hotel will come from Stephane Dupoux, whose interior design firm has designed highly stylized bars, nightclubs and hotels, including Buddha Bar and Cielo in Manhattan and the Gansevoort Beach Club hotel in South Beach.  The new hotel, Mr. Feeley said, will have high-definition flat-screen televisions, whitewashed walls, restored hardwood floors, cedar platform beds and black slate tile bathrooms with a large window in the wall separating the shower from the hotel room.  For winter visitors, there will be a 2,000-square-foot wine cellar and the developer will update the wood-burning fireplaces in the restaurant and in the lobby, Mr. Feeley said.  The Shepherd's Neck Inn was originally called Montauk Arms. It was built by Carl Fisher, the developer who, with a partner, created Miami Beach from swampland in the 1920s.  After that success, Fisher tried to build a similar resort in Montauk. A devastating hurricane and the stock market crash of 1929 left Fisher financially ruined, but not before he had planned an entire community in Montauk for the wealthy and partially created some of it, including private homes, grand hotels, a yacht club, a school and office buildings.  The inn was to serve as apartments for the managers of his resorts in Montauk, according to a history provided by the Montauk Library. ''We feel a connection with Carl Fisher's original concept and his connection to both markets where we are opening, in Miami and Montauk,'' Mr. Feeley said.  In the Region | Long Island  ",

            "text": "  THIS former whaling port on Gardiner's Bay, now a cozy two-square-mile village of restored historic homes, has caught the fancy of condominium developers.  Three projects were proposed recently within two months, according to the mayor of this East End village, Gregory Ferraris. The biggest, which has generated the most interest, is a plan to restore and develop the former Bulova Watchcase Factory.  ''Most of Sag Harbor worked here at one time,'' Mr. Ferraris said of the 1880 Italianate brick factory on 2.5 acres. It employed more than 500 people at its peak, and over the years manufactured gold and silver jewelry and, in its last decades, watch casings, he said.  Bulova bought the building in 1936 and ended its operations there in 1981. But the site had been contaminated by heavy metals over its long history, the mayor said, and since Bulova's departure it has crumbled and decayed. Bricks still lay in a pile at the base of the four-story factory on a recent wind-blown morning.  Now the site, still on the New York State Superfund list, is nearly cleaned up, the mayor said.  Last January, Cape Advisors, a Manhattan development firm, bought the building for $16 million, according to David Kronman, a project developer for the company. The owners will present a proposal for a condominium development of 63 apartments and 18 town-house-style units, two per building, to the planning board on Jan. 23.  And that's just the start of the approval process. Officials are fiercely protective of the village's eclectic mix of architecture, which ranges from 1700's Federalist two-stories to 19th-century clapboard fishermen's cottages, and its views both from land and from boats on the water. Sag Harbor has five review boards that must approve any development project.  Cape Advisors hopes that the reputation of its architecture firm, Beyer Blinder Belle, will help to win the village over. That firm, the lead architect on the main interior renovation of Grand Central Terminal in 1998, worked on the restoration of Ellis Island together with the Boston firm Notter, Feingold Alexander, according to Michael Wetstone, an associate partner at Beyer Blinder Belle.  In aerial views, the Bulova building, with jutting 24-foot-wide brick extensions added at different times over the years, is shaped like an ancient hieroglyph etched on a roughly triangular lot that borders four streets.  Nearly all of the future condominiums would have two walls of 7-foot-high windows, exposed brick and heavy timbers, Mr. Wetstone said. ''You'll get a really open, airy sense of space'' in the lofts, with floods of natural light and 12-foot ceilings.  The units will range in size from 600-square-foot studios to a 2,700-square-foot four-bedroom town house duplex, Mr. Kronman said.  The nine town houses, which will replace the parking lot, will also have a courtyard and a glass-enclosed swimming pool.  Penthouse units in the restored factory building will have walled-off areas of the roof, which will have plantings and soil up to a foot deep, Mr. Wetstone said.  The buildings will also have energy-saving heating and cooling systems, he said, citing solar panels, underground geothermal cooling pipes and small turbines that capture heat created from generating electricity.  The other two proposed condominium projects are next to the highly coveted waterfront.  On Ferry Road, at the base of the bridge that connects Sag Harbor to North Haven, the developer Michael Maidan is planning 22 condominiums, each with its own boat slip. Mr. Maidan's firm Code Red is also planning a second 20-unit condominium nearby at 21 West Water Street, the site of a former nightclub.  Like residents near the Bulova factory, which has been an eyesore for nearly 25 years, neighbors of the nightclub are welcoming change on that site, according to the mayor. The Water Street proposal, and the new boardwalk that the developer is planning, will also reduce the amount of concrete and add landscaping.  To help keep developers' designs from overtaxing village infrastructure like the sewage treatment plant, the village planning consultant, Richard Warren of Inter-Science Research Associates, has been attending all planning meetings since July at the request of the mayor, he said.  ''You have three very large projects for sleepy little Sag Harbor,'' Mr. Warren said, ''and we want to get them right.''  Whatever the final designs, local real estate brokers are confident that the units will command top prices.  Robert Evjen, a broker in Prudential Douglas Elliman's Sag Harbor office, said he had a list of 30 interested prospective buyers for the three projects.  Since the projects are all within walking distance of Main Street and downtown Sag Harbor, Mr. Evjen said, the prices for most of the units are likely to exceed $1 million.  A three-year waiting list for slips at the dock may also propel demand for Mr. Maidan's project at Ferry Road, he added. ''We've already had people looking to purchase those units just for the boat slips alone, even before any prices have been set,'' Mr. Evjen said.  The loft-style condos at the Bulova building will be unique to the village and, more broadly, to the East End, he said. ''There's nothing else like it,'' he added, citing the great views of Gardiner's Bay and the dock.  Potential buyers, Mr. Evjen said, are other East End homeowners who want to downsize, and foreign and local investors.  Wealthy boaters will also welcome new condos close to the dock of this little village, he said. ''Sometimes, people like to plunk down some money on a pied-\u00e0-terre and have a place to stay away from their yacht.''  In the Region | Long Island  ",

            "text": "  IT is a fine feeling to step into the elevator of an apartment building, press the button marked ''PH'' and take a ride to the top -- or at least near the top. And at a time when the wealthiest New Yorkers are getting even wealthier, there are more buildings in Manhattan with many more of these elevator buttons that bespeak the privileges of penthouse living.  Christine Harris, a 34-year-old director at UBS Global Asset Management in Manhattan, expects to experience that feeling when she and her boyfriend move into their $2.5 million 11th-floor penthouse on the northern edges of Chelsea when the apartment is completed next summer.  Speaking by telephone over the clatter of the UBS trading floor, Ms. Harris calmly envisioned opening her apartment to friends for French feasts and glasses of pinot, and unwinding after work on her private 700-square-foot terrace.  ''It's just nice to come home on a summer night and have a bottle of wine when you're in all of this madness in the city,'' she said.  While many Manhattan developers are scrambling to find buyers for their newly constructed and converted luxury apartments, they say they're having little trouble selling their penthouses, which have become the trinkets of choice in the wake of the city's record Wall Street bonus season. These apartments, which have accounted for just 2.5 percent of the sales transactions in Manhattan over roughly the last two decades, are now often selling faster than the cheaper studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments.  At Ms. Harris's new building, the Onyx at 261 West 28th Street, Bronfman Haymes Real Estate Partners has contracts to sell all three of the building's penthouses, while 30 of the other 52 units remain unsold.  At 170 East End Avenue (at 88th Street), Skyline Developers sold one penthouse for $12 million, and the one next door for $14 million. Skyline's president, Orin Wilf, said he had turned down an offer of $14.5 million to see if he could get $16 million for each of the two remaining penthouses. Fifty-one of the 93 units are unsold in the building. He said he had negotiated on prices for apartments on the lower floors in the past.  Mr. Wilf says he thinks that the penthouses will sell even better when buyers see the completed apartments. ''We're in no rush to sell them,'' he said while standing in one half-constructed penthouse over the barks of dogs in Carl Schurz Park, 19 stories below.  Even at 15 Central Park West (at 61st Street), all 15 penthouses in the project's two buildings have been sold for prices as high as $45 million, while about 30 of the building's 202 units remain unsold. ''I wish we had 20 more to sell,'' said William Lie Zeckendorf, a co-chairman of Zeckendorf Development.  Penthouses, which once were identified more with bachelors and newlyweds seeking terrace space for their cocktail parties, are even attracting the stroller crowd, which seems to like the extra bedrooms and terraces found in the newer residential buildings.  When Gregory O'Hara, a private equity investor, needed to relocate his family to New York from Miami, his wife, Glorimar, started looking for homes that would give them some outdoor space for their 14-month-old son, Henry.  The couple bought a $5.5 million triplex at 5 East 13th Street. Standing in the penthouse she will move into next month, Ms. O'Hara described her plans to set up a swing set, sandbox and outdoor movie theater on the terrace as Henry grinned and toddled his first tentative steps.  ''It may be great for a bachelor, but it's great for a family,'' Ms. O'Hara said. ''We have lots of outdoor space.''  Brokers say that Wall Street and hedge fund executives are often the first in line for penthouses, because the apartments confirm their ''master of the universe'' status among their neighbors.  Maureen Carroll, who previously worked on Wall Street and who now has her own brokerage firm specializing in selling apartments to Wall Street executives, had one client turn down an apartment when he found out there was a better one in the building.  The ''second best'' notion apparently contradicts these executives' self-image. ''They're not going to live in a building where they're the second-largest shareholder or there's another unit that's larger,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''The game doesn't stop when you go home at night.''  Average prices for penthouses in Manhattan jumped by 16.6 percent to $2.3 million in 2006, from $2 million in 2005, according to data collected by the Miller Samuel appraisal company. The number of deals jumped to 225 in 2006, from 184 in 2005. Jonathan J. Miller, the company's president, predicts these numbers will grow in 2007 because most penthouse buyers like Ms. Harris have not yet closed on their new condominiums.  These strong penthouse sales are persuading more developers to push the limits on how they define penthouses, and in some cases, they are making them more lavish than ever before. Shaun Osher, the chief executive of Core Group Marketing, which is handling the Onyx, is advising developers on the 25 other projects his company represents, to design all of their penthouses with more elaborate finishes so that they can ask even higher prices.  Josh Guberman, the president and chief executive of the Core Development Group (which has no relation to Mr. Osher's firm), sold the O'Haras their triplex at 5 East 13th only 48 hours after sales began last summer. He said he now planned to divide one penthouse in his next project, on the Upper East Side, into two duplexes, which will be priced at $5.5 million each.  Edward Minskoff, the president of Edward J. Minskoff Equities Inc., sold five penthouses at 101 Warren Street in TriBeCa at prices ranging from $4 million to $20 million within 10 days of its opening last April. Since then, he has sold about 150 of the building's 227 apartments. He is now building more apartments on top of the building than he had originally planned.  Donald J. Trump, who has been trying to sell his penthouse on the 31st and 32nd floors of 502 Park Avenue (59th Street) for $32 million on and off for the last two years, is now enlarging the master bedroom suite to about 1,400 square feet, up from 665 square feet, by enclosing an existing terrace and building a new terrace on top. He said he now planned to list the apartment at $42 million because the new terrace space will be on the higher floor and will open from the living room.  While Mr. Trump's penthouse is, in fact, on the top two floors, he contends that the definition of a penthouse has now become broader, a point his peers have also caught on to.  ''Penthouses are starting to go lower and lower in terms of the top of the building,'' Mr. Trump said. ''The top three, four or even five or six floors of the building can be defined as penthouses. The key is the number you put on the elevator.''  Mr. Trump says he typically builds six floors of penthouses in his towers. Mr. Minskoff calls the apartments on the 34th and 35th floors at 101 Warren ''sky homes'' and the apartments on the 32nd and 33rd floors penthouses.  On the other hand, at the Onyx, Matthew Bronfman and Evan Haymes stick to a strict interpretation: only the apartments on the top floor, the 11th, are called penthouses.  There are also penthouses in far shorter buildings. Mr. Guberman refers to the apartments on the top floor of his six-story building at 5 East 13th Street as penthouses, and he plans to do the same for his Upper East Side duplexes.  Michael Morris, a professor in Columbia's psychology department and the head of a social intelligence program at its business school, said the trend in penthouses revealed a marked preference for displays of conspicuous consumption. He said the people buying the penthouses exhibit their wealth by purchasing real estate that is physically higher than their neighbors', even if their apartments offer little more than views of surrounding buildings.  In many cases, he said, such buyers would rather have a penthouse on a high floor of a new building than an apartment in a prestigious but shorter building like the Dakota. ''It's a very simple marker of status,'' Professor Morris said. ''It's very easy to see. It's very easy for other people to see.''  But some penthouse buyers reject the idea that their purchases have anything to do with status. They say that newly constructed penthouses typically offer the most room, highest ceilings and most expansive terraces. They emphasize the privacy that such spaces can create in the heart of Manhattan.  Maria Bosoni and her husband, Alexandre, have put down a deposit for the $12 million penthouse on the 19th floor of 170 East End Avenue. The Bosonis currently live in a penthouse in the Bloomberg Tower.  Ms. Bosoni sees no special cachet in the ''penthouse'' designation. ''It makes no difference to us,'' she said. ''It's just that the penthouse is the better apartment. It makes for a better apartment because of the square footage and the height.''  Brokers agree that while their buyers are pretty direct about what they want from their penthouses, they also like the fact that newly built versions have more room than those of the past.  Servants were typically the city's earliest inhabitants of apartment buildings' top floors, because getting up there involved climbing so many stairs. Few New Yorkers wanted to spend time on terraces because of the black soot spewing from the elevated trains.  Kathy Sloane, a senior vice president of Brown Harris Stevens and the broker for Mr. Trump's apartment at 502 Park, said that buyers who think they want a prewar penthouse may not like what they find.  ''Penthouses were more difficult to sell because they're often quirky,'' she said. ''They weren't designed to be penthouses. People weren't necessarily ready to take on the task of making a great penthouse out of a lot of rooms.''  Developers are also expanding the definition of penthouse to link it more to lifestyle than to height. Mr. Guberman is adding play areas to the fifth-, sixth- and seventh-floor apartments at a second East Side project, at 433 East 74th Street, to attract family buyers. He plans to call the seventh-floor apartments penthouses and the fifth- and sixth-floor units ''flex'' penthouses.  ''A penthouse talks to the world of exclusion and privacy,'' Mr. Guberman said. ''It doesn't really matter if it has five stories or eight stories. Once you get up there, it's about having your own oasis separate and removed from the balance of the building.''  Mr. Minskoff, the creator of sky homes and penthouses at 101 Warren, said that even he can be confused by the definitions he has come up with. ''They're all very large apartments with high ceilings almost at the top of the building,'' he said. ''I'm not sure if you can absolutely differentiate.''  Mr. Trump is cautious about how long the penthouse craze may last and won't say how many penthouses he may build in his next New York project, a condo in SoHo that won't be completed for two and a half years. But he contends that penthouses will always have more allure than brownstones, with their understated charms.  ''I live in a beautiful penthouse because I love the views,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I look at brownstones: You're looking at garbage cans, and you look at air-conditioning units. You just can't compare.''  ",

            "text": "  DOUGLAS PINTER, a San Francisco real estate developer and the former chief executive of a long-forgotten Internet start-up, is used to the ups and downs of the business world, but his introduction to the pitfalls of New York City real estate has been a bit abrupt.  Just last month, Mr. Pinter closed on his $2.4 million 10th-floor apartment in a notable new condominium, the Urban Glass House, the last residential commission of Philip Johnson, modeled loosely on the architect's own home in Connecticut and marketed as a ''modernist luxury residence.''  Mr. Pinter liked the building's light and airy look, even though its location, at Spring and Washington Streets, was in a grungy no-name land between Greenwich Village, TriBeCa and SoHo. It is across the street from ventilation shafts for the Holland Tunnel. Still, some upper-floor apartments have views to the south, and most of the apartments have views of the river to the north and west. At least for now.  But in the last month, with most of the 40 apartments in the building sold or in contract, the New York City Sanitation Department said that it planned to take over a large parking lot just to the north and diagonally opposite the Urban Glass House. It would put up a garage as tall as a 15-story building and longer than a football field that promises to block much of the view of the river from many apartments.  Having a view blocked by a newer, bigger building is an old story in New York. But seldom has the view from such a distinctive building been threatened so soon after the ink on so many sales contracts has dried. The building opened in October.  Since then, Mr. Pinter and his neighbors, an affluent mix of models, minor celebrities and Wall Street executives who spent $2 million or more for their apartments, have been gathering information and organizing.  Mr. Pinter, who calls himself semiretired, said he was looking for ''like-minded residents'' to join him at a hearing called by the Sanitation Department to discuss plans for the new garage.  ''It's a shame,'' Mr. Pinter said. ''Invariably something would have been built there, but here is a building that was critically acclaimed architecturally, modest in size and scale and not gaudy, facing a consolidated sanitation garage.''  The Sanitation Department plan was put forth in a 46-page document posted on the department's Web site. The document was dated Dec. 28 but was first spotted in early January by residents of the neighborhood. The plans call for putting up a garage 140 to 150 feet high on the lot, which is bounded by Spring, Washington and West Streets and to the north by a large office and warehouse building. The Urban Glass House tops out at 137 feet.  The garage's ground floor would be used by the United Parcel Service, which now parks its trucks on the lot, while the rest of the building would be used by the Sanitation Department, consolidating three garages. A smaller garage just to the south of the parking lot and next to the ventilation shafts would be turned into a truck wash and refueling depot, storing 13,000 gallons of fuel and oil.  Vito Turso, a deputy sanitation commissioner, said that the garage was needed to replace garages along the river in the newly established Hudson River Park. ''We are trying to be as understanding and as good a neighbor as we can to that community,'' Mr. Turso said, ''recognizing that we still need to provide refuse collection, recycling and snow removal to that part of town.''  Abe Shnay, a partner in the group that developed the Urban Glass House, said that buyers were still signing contracts and that most were aware that the parking lot could someday be developed. At one point, he said, there were rumors that a high-rise would go up on the site. ''The reality is that on the upper floors the best views are to the south, incredible views of the upper harbor and the Statue of Liberty,'' he said.  But Michael Shvo, the president of Shvo Marketing, a real estate company that is not involved with the Urban Glass House, said he always tells buyers, ''There are only two views in New York that are guaranteed: if you are on a park, or if you are facing a brick wall.''  Search Results: Condo in the Raw  CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING, the director of engineering at Google's rapidly expanding New York office, knows how to find needles in what he calls a ''20 terabyte haystack.''  Mr. Nevill-Manning, who invented Google's Froogle shopping service, has now also threaded the real estate needle and landed one of downtown's most unusual and, for a while, hardest-to-sell properties: the rooftop English castle topped by a live-in copper dome at 150 Nassau Street, an ornate turn-of-the-last-century building that was once New York's tallest skyscraper.  Mr. Nevill-Manning and his wife, Kristin, who also works at Google's New York office, have just closed on one of the most expensive condominiums in the financial district, paying $6.45 million for the penthouse, which has 6,400 square feet of space spread over three floors atop a Romanesque and Renaissance Revival building, according to brokers briefed on the transaction.  The apartment has a 30-by-30-foot outdoor deck, a private terrace that winds around the steep copper-clad roof, huge semicircular windows, 18-foot ceilings and a 360-degree view -- at least until the developer Forest City builds a 75-story skyscraper on the site of a parking lot for New York Downtown Hospital nearby. It has one major drawback, however: the space has no plumbing or electricity or interior walls, and it needs work estimated to cost $2 million or more, depending on the detail, before anyone can move in.  But if you want to know one version of what it might look like, you might look at the Spike Lee film ''Inside Man,'' released last year and starring Denzel Washington. The space was dressed up and appeared as the office of Jodie Foster's character, a mysterious power broker.  The apartment was the last unsold unit in the 23-story building, a city landmark, built in 1895 as the American Tract Society Building. It happened to go on the market just days before the attack on the World Trade Center in September 2001.  Over the last few years, the apartment was offered through some of the largest brokerages in the city, Prudential Douglas Elliman and Brown Harris Stevens. It was finally sold by Adam Modlin and Reuben Davis of the Modlin Group, a small firm. Along the way, the asking price went from $12 million, including a $2 million credit toward the cost of the interior, to $6.9 million.  Estimating Celebrity Value  HOW much is celebrity really worth? Only two years after the actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her husband, Chris Martin, the British rocker, paid $7.95 million for a 7,000-square-foot condominium in TriBeCa, they have put it back on the market for an even $14 million.  The apartment on Harrison Street has 1,600 square feet of gardens and outdoor space, including a rooftop soaking pool, an elevator, a steam shower, six bedrooms and four and half baths. It also has a finished basement with two washers and two dryers.  The listing broker, Carter Wilcox of the Corcoran Group, did not return telephone calls. But Stephen Huvane, Ms. Paltrow's publicist, said ''considerable'' work had been done on the unit. ''I really doubt there is such a thing as 'celebrity' value at that price range,'' he said. ''But I am not a real estate professional.''  BIG DEAL E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com  ",

            "text": "  WHAT kind of second home can you get these days for $250,000? It depends on where you're looking.  Want something of a bargain? Then head north. Even though the Canadian dollar has gained strength recently against its American counterpart, second homes just over the border still represent relatively good value for buyers.  In the Eastern Townships, a rural region just over an hour southeast of Montreal ''you can expect a good quality home of 2,000 to 2,400 square feet with access to the water,'' said Albert Brandt of ReMax d'Abord in Magog, a real estate agent who has been selling there for 20 years. With about 10 towns to choose from like Magog, Knowlton and North Hatley, the region -- a four-and-a-half-hour drive from Boston and six hours from New York -- is a favorite of Montreal residents, whose cosmopolitan tastes in food, wine and clothing add flair to local restaurants and shops.  Americans represent no more than 5 to 10 percent of second-home buyers there, Mr. Brandt said, and most of them buy in North Hatley, known to Americans for its upscale lakeside inns like Hovey Manor. English-speaking buyers have bought second homes in the region for generations, drawn by its low density, excellent skiing, pristine lakes and mountains.  A recent listing in Magog offered a 1,920-square-foot three-bedroom, two-bathroom house for 239,000 Canadian dollars (about $199,700 U.S. at 1.20 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar), with taxes of 2,539 Canadian dollars. Another two-story house in Magog with three bedrooms and a view of Lake Memphremagog and Mount Orford is listed at 249,000 Canadian dollars, with taxes of 1,993 Canadian dollars.  Want to be by the water but don't want to leave the United States? Then forget much of the Northeast. ''Today you can't even think of smelling water, let alone seeing it, for that price,'' said Paul Disegna, an agent with ReMax Metro in Warwick, R.I.  But some properties in waterfront communities can apparently still be found for less than a quarter of a million on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Vice President Dick Cheney bought a second home in St. Michaels, Md., about 90 minutes from Washington, for $2.67 million in 2005. But second-home shoppers can find 1,000- to 1,500-square-foot cottages built in the 1950s in move-in condition for around $250,000, said Dawn Lednum, a broker with ReMax Blakeney in St. Michaels. Those houses are either in town, she said, or on nearby Tilghman Island.  Most buyers of second homes in St. Michaels arrive from Washington, northern Virginia or Pennsylvania, she said, with even a few from New Jersey. ''We have 600 miles of waterfront and 60 to 70 restaurants in the area to choose from,'' she said. ''This is not the beach crowd. There's not even a traffic light in town.''  The median price for a vacation home nationwide in 2005 was $204,100, according to the National Association of Realtors, making $250,000 sound like a reasonable sum with which to pursue that weekend getaway of your daydreams. And with the current slump in the real estate market, those buying now can make that amount stretch further than it did two years ago. In some parts of the country, real estate agents say, it's not uncommon for a buyer to get a home at 10 percent off the asking price.  Buyers moved by mountains and history have discovered Staunton, Va., in the central Shenandoah Valley. Close to the Blue Ridge Parkway and 30 minutes from Shenandoah National Park, the town of about 25,000 is easily reached from Washington by car or by Amtrak train.  ''It's an area that really appeals to people who really enjoy the outdoors,'' said David Bottenfield, who has been a broker for 12 years with Century 21-Premier Real Estate in Staunton. The town is at the junction of two major highways, I-81, running north-south, and I-64, running east-west. ''That's what's bringing growth,'' Mr. Bottenfield said. ''You can be at the beach in three to four hours, or in downtown D.C. in three hours.''  Buyers with $250,000 to spend can still find an array of handsome historic houses, though prices have doubled in the last three years. There's a lively social, sports and cultural scene, with eight four-year colleges within a 45-minute drive. Bob Barron, the publisher of Preservation magazine, bought a weekend house in Staunton in 2003 with his partner. A friend had bought a house there and Mr. Barron, on a visit, ''came across this beautiful little town, chockablock with Victorian architecture, '' he said. ''The people cherish their architecture, and that creates a sense of identity.''  Feeling welcomed as a gay couple was essential to the decision to buy property, Mr. Barron said. ''People could not have been nicer.'' Their 1,200-square-foot house, built in 1900, cost less than $150,000. It was a one-room structure that Mr. Barron described as ''a dilapidated old carriage house''; the two have since spent an additional $100,000 to renovate it. They enjoy the town's range of restaurants and local theater -- and the ability to walk everywhere.  Buyers from the Chicago area seeking affordable lakefront houses are heading about 100 miles northeast to Cass County, Mich., where $250,000 buys a 1,250-square-foot house built in the 1940s or 1950s, probably in move-in condition. The county has several lakes and a population of 50,000 spread over 30 square miles, much of it grain and dairy farmland, said Harry Stemple, an agent with ReMax Shore Acres in Cassopolis, Mich.  Prices there haven't changed much, rising 3 to 5 percent a year, according to Mr. Stemple. The average time it takes to sell a home is now about 180 days, he said. ''We're seeing a slump,'' he said. ''People are getting homes for 5 to 10 percent below the asking price and they're taking longer to sell. Eighteen months ago, prices were overinflated. Now they're a little more realistic.''  JACK DAL SANTO, a builder from the South Side of Chicago, bought a 600-square-foot cottage in Cass County on Eagle Lake in 2003 for $250,000, a property between houses owned by two sisters, both of them -- typical of the area -- longtime residents. He tore down the cottage and spent $400,000 to build a new four-bedroom, three-bath, 3,000-square-foot ranch-style house. ''It was worth it for the waterfront land alone,'' he said.  Mr. Dal Santo looked at property in Lake Geneva, Wis., but said it was ''twice the price, twice the taxes'' than what he found in Cass County. ''People north of Chicago go to Wisconsin, and those south head to Michigan,'' he said. ''It's more of a middle-income, blue-collar group here.'' Many families have owned summer homes there for generations, and there's not a lot of turnover. ''Its all word of mouth,'' he said. ''A property will sell before it's even hit the market.''  On the West Coast, Scott Kubay, an agent with Century 21 Fairway Realty, says Victorville, Calif., about 80 miles northeast of Los Angeles, has become a popular second-home location, even with one of the state's largest prisons nearby.  ''We're exploding here, with 20 to 30 percent appreciation per year,'' up until last year, he said. But buyers can still find properties for $250,000, mostly ranch-style homes. ''It's a rural environment,'' he said, ''but it offers access to the things you need.'' Boaters use nearby Lake Arrowhead, and it's a 30-minute drive to ski at Big Bear Mountain. Buyers are also looking at homes in the nearby towns of Hesperia, Phelan, Oak Hill and Lucerne Valley. In Victorville and neighboring Apple Valley, 89 properties that cost between $248,000 and $252,000 were sold last year, Mr. Kubay said -- in a state where the median price for a house is $561,000.  ''Pricing is lower because we are a relatively new area, built in the 1950s and 1960s,'' Mr. Kubay said.  Most second-home buyers drive two or three hours from Las Vegas, Los Angeles or San Diego. A 1,384-square-foot, three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bathroom ranch-style house built in 1952 on an acre in Apple Valley sold for exactly $250,000 last August. The asking price was $259,000.  People buy such houses for high desert vistas, clean air and hiking. Mr. Kubay, who lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan for years, said, ''It's a much slower pace up here.''  And all for $250,000.  Correction:  January 19, 2007, Friday  An article last Friday about $250,000 second homes around the nation misstated a lake open to the public near Victorville, Calif., a popular second-home area. It is Silverwood Lake, which is in a state recreation area, not Lake Arrowhead, which is private.  ",

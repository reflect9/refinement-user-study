            "text": "  With its combination of ''Prison Break'' and ''24,'' Fox edged ahead of NBC on Monday to win the important demographic of adults 18 to 49. According to Nielsen's estimates, ''Prison Break'' matched a season's best 9.9 million viewers at 8 p.m., while the sixth hour of ''24'' earned 14 million viewers to lead the 9 p.m. hour in total viewers ahead of NBC's ''Heroes'' (13.6 million). ''Heroes'' did remain the night's highest-rated show in the 18 to 49 demographic, ahead of second-place ''24.'' For the night, NBC outdrew Fox by a half million total viewers. Its game show at 8, ''Deal or No Deal,'' claimed the title of most-watched show on Monday (16.9 million), but the 10 o'clock hour remained NBC's weakest, as ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' attracted 7 million viewers opposite a repeat of CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (13.4 million). CBS broadcast reruns of its comedy lineup from 8 to 10 and finished third over all. ABC was fourth, despite new episodes of ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.7 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (5.7 million).  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

No other Fox premiere has ever garnered more total viewers; among adults 18 to 49, it tied the 1997 ''X-Files'' season debut. For the night, Fox outdrew CBS, NBC, ABC, and the CW combined by 78 percent in the 18-to-49 demographic. CBS was second over all, buoyed by ''NCIS'' at 8 (15.9 million). NBC ranked third as ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' led at 10 (14.1 million). On Friday, the Disney Channel posted its second-most-watched day on record as ''Jump In!'' with Corbin Bleu (''High School Musical'') and Keke Palmer (''Akeelah and the Bee''), drew 8.2 million viewers, the most for a Disney Channel original movie. Following it, 7.6 million viewers tuned in for the premiere of ''Cory in the House,'' the best start for a Disney series.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

According to Nielsen's estimates, the sixth edition of the Donald Trump series, ''The Apprentice,'' relocated from New York to Los Angeles, earned 9.1 million viewers from 9:30 to 11 p.m., about even with February's premiere of ''The Apprentice 5.'' NBC fared slightly better earlier in the night, as its musical competition, ''Grease: You're the One That I Want,'' averaged 11.6 million viewers from 8 to 9:30. NBC ranked fourth for the night in total viewers, but third among adults 18 to 49. Fox led over all, benefiting from an overrun of its afternoon coverage of the Philadelphia Eagles victory over the New York Giants. ABC was No. 2 for the night, winning the 8 and 9 p.m. hours with ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' (13.4 million) and ''Desperate Housewives'' (18.6 million). CBS, which broadcast new episodes of ''Cold Case'' at 9 (14.1 million) and ''Without a Trace'' at 10 (14.2 million), finished the night in fourth among adults 18 to 49, but ahead of NBC in total viewers.

The film will be the first musical for Ms. Streep, who has, nevertheless, sung in the movies ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' ''Postcards From the Edge'' and ''Death Becomes Her.''  The story of ''Mamma Mia!'' features 22 Abba songs and revolves around a bride-to-be and her once-rebellious single mother, who reared her on a Greek island without disclosing the identity of her child's father. The young woman locates three possibilities and invites them to the wedding.  ",

According to Nielsen's estimates, the Day 6 debut earned 15.7 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m. Sunday, a slight decline over its year-ago season premiere (16.2 million). However, Monday's two-hour second installment also drew 15.7 million viewers, a modest improvement over the fifth season's second episode (14.9 million). CBS was No. 1 on Sunday, benefiting from an overrun of its N.F.L. playoffs coverage, followed by an interview with President Bush on ''60 Minutes'' at approximately 8:30 (17.2 million). ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' (16.7 million) also outdrew ''24'' during the 9 p.m. hour Sunday. On Monday, NBC's telecast of the 64th annual Golden Globes led during every half-hour of the night and averaged 20 million viewers over all, that award show's highest ratings in three years. NBC fared less well Sunday as the second week of ''Grease: You're the One That I Want'' at 8 (8.2 million) and ''The Apprentice'' at 9 (7.3 million) fell to fourth place.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

CBS was No. 2 for the night, as ''Criminal Minds'' at 9 (13.4 million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10 (13.7 million) drew solid audiences.

Pushed back because of the live presidential address at 9 p.m., ''Knights of Prosperity'' drew 5.2 million viewers at about 9:30, according to Nielsen's estimates, while ''In Case of Emergency'' reached 5.8 million at 10. ABC did lead the 8 p.m. hour in total viewers with two episodes of ''According to Jim'' at 8 (8.3 million) and 8:30 (8.8 million). ABC finished third for the night. Among adults 18 to 49, CBS's premiere of ''Armed and Dangerous'' (8.2 million) won the 8 p.m. hour, while reruns of ''Criminal Minds'' from 9:30 to 10:30 (11.4 million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10:30 (10.1 million) put CBS on top for the night over all. NBC ranked second for the night, as an abbreviated ''Deal or No Deal'' (11.3 million) following President Bush's speech was the night's highest rated show among adults 18 to 49. (Nielsen estimated that 42.5 million viewers tuned in for the president's speech.) On the CW, Week 2 of ''Beauty and the Geek'' (3.9 million), the third edition of the series, led the 8 p.m. hour in the network's target demographic of adults 18 to 34.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

According to Nielsen's estimates, the 9 p.m. episode, in which Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) managed to save himself from jail time, was the highest-rated show of the night, drawing 17.8 million viewers. It followed an 8 p.m. repeat of ''House'' (9 million), which also ranked first in its time slot among adults 18 to 49, even as a rerun of CBS's ''NCIS'' at 8 outdrew it in total viewers (12.8 million). NBC led the 10 p.m. hour with ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (14.5 million) and edged out CBS for second place for the night. NBC earned modest ratings successes earlier in the night with ''Dateline'' at 8 (9.6 million) and ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' at 9 (11.9 million). From 9 to 11, CBS's coverage of the 33rd Annual People's Choice Awards, with Queen Latifah as host, drew 11.3 million viewers, a slight increase from the show's ratings a year ago. ABC was fourth for the night as ''Big Day'' continued to garner small audiences at 9 (4.4 million) and 9:30 (4 million).  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

            "text": "  As the 64th annual Golden Globes unfolded on Monday, ''Babel'' won the award for best dramatic movie. And Martin Scorsese won for directing ''The Departed,'' while ''Dreamgirls'' scooped up awards for best comedy/musical and for a pair of its actors -- keeping the films in tight competition for top honors in the Hollywood awards race.  In a rather remarkable feat, Helen Mirren won best actress awards for playing two Queen Elizabeths: one for the television mini-series ''Elizabeth I'' and the second for portraying Elizabeth II in the film ''The Queen.''  Still, the evening's real significance lay in the ritual: Hollywood's first big awards party of the year was under way.  No film truly dominated the affair. Jennifer Hudson, a newcomer, won for best supporting actress in a motion picture for playing a determined but less-than-svelte singer in ''Dreamgirls,'' while the longtime Hollywood star Eddie Murphy -- himself a newcomer to awards glory -- won best supporting actor as a singer on the decline.  Dozens of television and movie stars braving unusually chilly temperatures made their way along 30,000 square feet of red carpet, the longest such artifact in the awards world, and were greeted by approximately 1,500 credentialed journalists, who could well have matched the number of guests at the event.  Mr. Murphy's and Ms. Hudson's wins gave early moments of triumph to ''Dreamgirls'' in a season in which no single film has dominated audience interest, or critical enthusiasm.  Bursting into tears, Ms. Hudson, who first gained notice on ''American Idol'' and had her first screen role in this film, told the audience filled with Hollywood's top movie and television stars: ''You don't know how much this does for my confidence. Because of this, it makes me feel like I'm part of a community, it makes me feel like an actress, and you don't understand how much that feels good today.'' Afterwards, Ms. Hudson dedicated her award to Florence Ballard, one of the original Supremes, ''a lady who never got a fair chance.''  Speaking to reporters after receiving his award, Mr. Murphy, whose career has seen a jagged series of highs and lows, said that, much like older women, actors of color can also find it difficult to land choice roles. ''Hey, I'm a minority, too,'' he said. ''It's tough to be a black person in this town as well.''  Forest Whitaker was named best actor in a dramatic movie for his portrayal of Idi Amin in ''The Last King of Scotland.''  And as she won best actress in a comedy or musical for ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' one somewhat older woman, Meryl Streep, rocked the gathering when she donned a pair of reading glasses and declared, ''I think I've worked with everybody in the room.'' She paused. ''Yes, I have,'' she concluded.  She won for playing an entertainingly monstrous fashion editor savaging her assistants, played by Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt. Ms. Blunt won her own Golden Globe, for best actress in a television mini-series, for ''Gideon's Daughter.''  The best foreign language film prize went to ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' an unusual twist, in that the movie, with dialogue in Japanese, was directed by Clint Eastwood. Backstage, Mr. Eastwood, positively ebullient, told the press that he might make a Hungarian or Lithuanian movie next. When he was asked to pose with a statue, he said, \"You want me to do my Paris Hilton.\"  The Globes are voted on by the 80 or so members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. By contrast, the Oscars are voted on by the nearly 6,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Throughout the night, those who made or starred in the dozens of contending movies and programs looked for any edge from the event.  Mr. Scorsese is now firmly a contender for this year's Academy Awards; he has never received that honor, despite repeated nominations.  Graham King, a producer of ''The Departed,'' said shortly before the show began: ''Of course I care. I didn't care yesterday. But now I care a lot. We're under a microscope right now, and the whole world is watching. A win would be nice.''  Sacha Baron Cohen was named best actor in a musical or comedy for his performance in ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.''  The box-office performance of the contenders for best dramatic picture was certainly uneven. ''Babel,'' which had the most Globe nominations, seven, has taken in only $21 million in this country. This multi-character drama about cultural misunderstanding across the globe, directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, vied for best picture in the drama category with Martin Scorsese's ''Departed,'' which had six nominations. That film, a bloody Irish mob drama with a scene-chewing performance by Jack Nicholson and a cast of younger stars, has been more like a blockbuster success, taking in $121 million in this country and about as much again overseas.  Other nominees for best film drama included ''Little Children,'' a sober story of married couples in suburbia; ''Bobby,'' which portrays the interlocking lives of people who meet on the night of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles; and ''The Queen,'' a character study of Queen Elizabeth II in the days following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.  The HBO film, ''Elizabeth I,'' also won best TV film, and won a statue for Jeremy Irons as best supporting actor in his portrayal of Elizabeth I's devoted admirer. Peter Morgan won best screenplay for ''The Queen.''  On the television side, Hugh Laurie won for best actor in a series, for his portrayal of a tortured, but talented doctor in ''House.'' He said he was surprised at the win, adding, ''I'm literally without a speech,'' and suggested that with all the presents that come to nominees, no one had thought to offer a free speech. ''There's a gap in the market,'' he said.  Alec Baldwin won for best actor in a television series, musical or comedy for his work in ''30 Rock.''  ''Ugly Betty,'' originally a hit Spanish-language telenovela brought to the United States and shown on ABC, won for best musical or comedy series. The cast, including the producer Salma Hayek and the co-star Vanessa Williams, poured onto the stage to celebrate. America Ferrera, fighting back tears and looking quite beautiful, won best actress in a comedy for playing the lead. ''Thank you for recognizing a character who is truly bringing a new face to television,'' she said, and for bringing a message to young girls that they are ''worthy and lovable.''  The Disney-Pixar film ''Cars'' won best animated feature, in the debut of the category for the Globes.  From the outset, ''Dreamgirls,'' with five nominations, was favored to win the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical. But it has yet to break out as a major hit at the box office, having taken in about $67 million so far in domestic markets.  Other nominees in that category included the mockumentary ''Borat''; ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' the independent hit about a dysfunctional family on the road to a children's beauty contest; ''The Devil Wears Prada''; and ''Thank You for Smoking,'' a satire about lobbying.  In addition to 25 awards for work during 2006, the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award went to the actor and filmmaker Warren Beatty for what the association called his ''outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.'' Mr. Beatty, 69, has made his mark as a political thinker and industry statesman, while directing five films and appearing in nearly two dozen since his 1961 performance in ''Splendor in the Grass.''  Following the event, celebrities, their guests and anyone who could find a way in were scheduled to attend at least seven parties, including two off-site. The physical feat of accommodating so many people can lead to extraordinary measures: HBO had work crews build a floor over the pool at the Beverly Hilton Hotel to accommodate the crowd.  The timing of the Globes -- right after Oscar nomination ballots have been returned, but before those results are announced -- makes for a significant stirring of the awards season tea leaves.  Because the Globes split feature films into two categories -- there are best picture awards for both drama and musical/comedy -- their implications for the Oscar race are not always easy to discern. Last year, ''Brokeback Mountain'' won the Globe for best dramatic picture, but ''Crash,'' an also-ran at the Globes, won the Academy Award for best picture.  This year, early awards season favorites like ''The Departed'' and ''Dreamgirls'' were not in direct competition. Yet several films and individuals arrived this year with much to be gained or lost. ''Dreamgirls'' fell short of early awards hype, and a win gave the musical much needed oxygen for the rest of the awards season.  ''Right now I'm conserving my energy for future projects,'' Mr. Scorsese said before the show of his decision not to campaign actively for awards after having often been spurned in the past. ''But it's good to be here.''  The Academy Award nominations are to be announced on Jan. 23, with the awards given on Feb. 25.  ",

According to Nielsen's time-zone-adjusted estimates, the football game dominated in every half-hour of the night, attracting 28.7 million viewers. Among adults 18 to 49, Fox posted its highest-rated Monday in three years. CBS ranked second for the night, aided by ''CSI: Miami'' at 10 (15.9 million) and its comedies in the 9 p.m. hour, ''Two and a Half Men'' (14.8 million) and ''The New Adventures of Old Christine'' (12.2 million). NBC was No. 2 in the 8 o'clock hour with ''Deal or No Deal'' (14 million), but its two repeats of ''Heroes'' finished last at 9 (5.7 million) and 10 (4.1 million). ABC's line-up of ''Wife Swap'' at 8 (8 million), ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.1 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (4.7 million) once again put the network in fourth place for the night in total viewers, but among adults 18 to 49, NBC lagged slightly behind it.

            "text": "  Everything went as planned for ''Dreamgirls,'' a perfectly confected Oscar machine. Great cast, showstoppers that stopped the show, and a wonderful back story in Jennifer Hudson, the washed-out ''American Idol'' turned movie star. And it was all propelled by hype-filled rollout, plenty of strong reviews and, finally, widespread belief that it was the favorite in the best-picture throwdown.  Everything continued to go as planned during the news conference at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences here on Tuesday morning, with this crowd-pleasing costume musical racking up eight nominations. And then the best-picture category was announced: ''Babel,'' ''The Departed,'' ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' ''The Queen'' and ''Letters From Iwo Jima.''  Wait. Are they nominating six this year? The hundreds of reporters in the auditorium were leaning heads together, making sure that they did not hear the name ''Dreamgirls.''  They did not.  ''Dreamgirls'' had the most nominations for the day, eight, including a pair for its supporting players, Eddie Murphy and Ms. Hudson, but it will not be around for the war. It is the first film in many decades to have the most nominations and not be in the best-picture category.  The seven nominations for ''Babel'' prove that the academy is a sucker for a weave of ambitious filmmaking (multiple languages and stories are represented) and big stars in small roles. (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were in just one segment of the movie's triptych.)  ''Pan's Labyrinth,'' a Spanish-language film, received a half-dozen nominations, as did ''The Queen,'' in an array that was announced by Sid Ganis, president of the academy, and the actress Salma Hayek at 5:38 a.m Pacific time; it was planned to land in the middle of morning shows in the East.  Much of what happened was expected -- Forest Whitaker and Helen Mirren, who played monarchs to very different effect -- continued their stately walk to the podium, with nominations for best actor and best actress. (''I'm not going to win in a million years, and that's absolutely fine,'' said Kate Winslet, a fellow nominee in the actress category.)  Ms. Mirren said of her nomination: ''It's the mother lode. It's the big mama of the whole thing. There's nothing in the whole world like the Oscars.''  Mr. Whitaker described his excitement: ''I'm stoked. I have to find the right word, and 'stoked' is O.K.,'' he said, joining the ritual outpouring of gratitude and expectation.  Mr. Murphy, a seasoned veteran, and Ms. Hudson, an absolute beginner, were joined in the supporting categories by 10-year-old Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin, 72, for their roles in ''Little Miss Sunshine.'' (It's been 38 years since Mr. Arkin's last nomination, for ''The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.'' )  The supporting-actor category was notable for its eclecticism, with Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of a pedophile in ''Little Children'' being recognized, as was Rinko Kikuchi's role in ''Babel'' as a deaf-mute Japanese girl with a lot on her mind. In total, out of 20 slots for acting awards, 5 black actors were nominated, 2 Latinas and a Japanese woman.  And in a year when the precursor awards have been all over the road, the movies came from all over the world. ''Cinema is an international art form, and you can do it in any language the artist dreams about,'' Mr. Ganis said after coming offstage. He pointed to Clint Eastwood's vivid example in making two movies in two languages about the same war.  The academy, frequently criticized for being a prisoner of convention, ventured far and wide in search of films that represented the year's most spectacular achievements. Tidy little movies like ''Little Miss Sunshine'' and ''The Queen'' were selected for best-picture nods, and two movies in which English is a second language -- ''Babel'' and ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' -- also made the cut, while ''The Departed,'' a big popcorn movie with a bloody, relentless end, was recognized as well.  Even ''United 93,'' a movie that made the unthinkable watchable, was given a significant nod when Paul Greengrass was nominated for best director. None of these movies had a built-in Oscar-winning apparatus -- far from it, actually, but perhaps that was precisely the point.  Los Angeles is a place that worships success, but can be very punishing when it comes to striving for it. Paramount/DreamWorks learned as much, as it sought to position ''Dreamgirls'' as a favorite and succeeded; but something went wrong on the way to the podium. It most likely did not help that the movie, with its gorgeous songs and amazing costumes, was a tough sell to begin with among white males, a demographic that describes the majority of the academy's 5,800 voting members.  The marketing of the film didn't help, either. Regardless of what you have heard, ''Dreamgirls'' was a story that was about something, a particularly American story of success and redemption. Instead it was sold as a parade float, majestic and unstoppable. Behind that miscalculation, the basic blocking and tackling of an Oscar campaign fell short. The decision to send out screeners of the movie late was built on hubris -- the same reason that Parmount/DreamWorks chose to charge $25 for early peeks at the movie -- which suggested that it was an Important Film that must be seen on a big screen.  But the death of President Gerald Ford, combined with a national holiday, meant that most academy members did not get the film until Jan. 3, 10 days after they had received ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' a movie that wasn't even supposed to come out in 2006. That means that academy members saw the hype long before they saw ''Dreamgirls'' and had just 10 days to see it before they voted. (''Flags of Our Fathers,'' another Paramount/Dreamworks project, this one from Mr. Eastwood and Steven Spielberg, came basted in Oscar juice and went nowhere.)  It made for a bad day at Paramount, although the studio's chief, Brad Grey, was traveling and not taking calls, so no one can say for sure. The studio can find solace in ''Babel,'' a movie from its specialty division, Paramount Vantage, that did extremely well on Tuesday.  At Warner Brothers, things did not go as planned, either. It was thought early on that ''Blood Diamond,'' with its serious themes and star wattage from Leonardo DiCaprio, would be a durable contender. Mr. DiCaprio scored a best-actor nomination. But it was Warner's ''Departed'' that landed in the thick of the best-picture race, and its director, a hardy unrequited perennial named Martin Scorsese, was also chosen. And the studio's decision to release Mr. Eastwood's ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' is looking pretty smart just about now.  Alan F. Horn, chief executive of Warner Brothers, said best-laid plans or not, he was thrilled for both directors, Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Eastwood -- the face-off will reprise 2005, when ''Million Dollar Baby'' edged out ''The Aviator'' -- and with the five nominations ''Blood Diamond'' received. (In one indication of ''The Departed's'' underlying strength going forward, Mark Wahlberg was nominated in the supporting category for his profane, explosive depiction of a police official.)  ''We ended up in a good place,'' Mr. Horn said.  Now that the nominations have been settled, the battle for credits will begin. The academy handout listed the best-picture nominations of both ''The Departed'' and ''Little Miss Sunshine'' with ''nominees to be determined.'' The academy will have to decide which of the five producers of ''Little Miss Sunshine'' deserve a statue, and although Graham King is currently listed, for the purposes of the best-picture nomination, as the sole producer of Warner Brothers' ''Departed,'' Mr. Grey, who packaged the movie as an agent before he came to Paramount, may yet have something to say about that. As murky as that seems, it can be said with certainty that it won't be pretty.  And, going forward, the best-picture race was left without a clear favorite, which is great news for the academy. The voters love a contest, and ABC does, too, because television of all kinds thrives on suspense. With a new host, Ellen DeGeneres, and a collection of films that millions of people actually paid money to see, ABC is hoping on reversing a drop-off in viewership and certainly improving on last year's 39 million viewers when the show comes up on Feb. 25.  The Oscar Nominees  Here are the nominees in major categories for the 79th Annual Academy Awards, which will be broadcast on Feb. 25 on ABC. A complete list is available at nytimes.com/film.

            "text": "  Screen Actors Nominees Are Unveiled  Leonardo DiCaprio and Helen Mirren came away with two nominations each when candidates for the 13th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards were announced yesterday in Los Angeles. Mr. DiCaprio was nominated in the lead-actor category for his performance in ''Blood Diamond'' and for his supporting role in ''The Departed.'' Ms. Mirren, right, was nominated for her depiction of Queen Elizabeth II in ''The Queen'' and of Queen Elizabeth I in ''Elizabeth I,'' an HBO prime-time production. As a leading man, Mr. DiCaprio will compete against Ryan Gosling in ''Half Nelson,'' Peter O'Toole in ''Venus,'' Will Smith in ''The Pursuit of Happyness'' and Forest Whitaker in ''The Last King of Scotland.'' Ms. Mirren's competitors in the best actress category in feature films are Pen\u00e9lope Cruz in ''Volver,'' Judi Dench in ''Notes on a Scandal,'' Meryl Streep in ''The Devil Wears Prada'' and Kate Winslet in ''Little Children.'' Supporting actor nominees, besides Mr. DiCaprio, were Alan Arkin, Jackie Earle Haley, Djimon Hounsou and Eddie Murphy; supporting actress nominees were Adriana Barraza, Cate Blanchett, Abigail Breslin, Jennifer Hudson and Rinko Kikuchi. The winners will be announced at a ceremony to be broadcast from Los Angeles on TNT and TBS on Jan. 28.  Omarion Starting The New Year on Top  The new album by Omarion, below, ''21'' (Epic), captured the No. 1 spots on the Billboard post-Christmas 200 and R&B/Hip-Hop album charts, with sales of 119,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan estimates. Akon's ''Konvicted'' (SRC/Universal) climbed from 10th place to second even though sales declined more than 50 percent, to 112,000. The ''Dreamgirls'' (Sony) soundtrack vaulted from 31st to third place, despite a sales decline of 16.6 percent, to 104,000 albums; and last week's chart-topper, Nas's ''Hip-Hop Is Dead'' (Def Jam), fell to fourth place, with a 71 percent slump in sales, to 101,000. The Young Jeezy album ''The Inspiration'' (Def Jam) re-entered the Top Five, moving from 18th place to 5th.  Dead but Not Quite Buried  ''Zyzzyx Rd.'' has earned a place in the record book, Variety reported yesterday, for ''the lowest tally for any pic since modern record-keeping began in the 1980s.'' While films like ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,'' ''Cars'' and ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' were pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars last year, ''Zyzzyx Rd.'' (pronounced ZY-zix) amassed a total of $30. The film, starring Tom Sizemore, Katherine Heigl and Leo Grillo, opened its six-day run in February in Dallas, making $20 in its debut showing, followed by an additional $10. The plot of the 90-minute thriller, written and directed by John Penney, involves a philandering accountant (Mr. Grillo) who goes to Las Vegas on a business trip. There he encounters the seductive Marissa (Ms. Heigl) and her jealous ex-boyfriend, Joey (Mr. Sizemore), whom they kill and bury in the Mojave Desert, the site of Zzyzx Road in Zzyzx, Calif. A summary written by the producer (Mr. Penney again) says, ''In the 'Death of a Salesman' meets 'Lolita' ending, 'Zyzzyx Rd.' reveals a shocking, tragic twist.''  ",

            "text": "  As New York City's aspiring singers descended upon ''American Idol'' on Wednesday, the episode drew 33.6 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m., according to Nielsen's estimates, giving Fox another commanding ratings victory on the night. CBS was a distant second in total viewers, as ''CSI: New York'' (13.4 million) led the 10 o'clock hour. CBS's new reality show, ''Armed and Famous'' (4.7 million), sank to fourth place at 8. NBC edged out CBS in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic for the night, winning second place behind Fox with the help of ''Deal or No Deal'' at 9 (10.1 million). Nielsen also estimated that the State of the Union address, carried live on Tuesday by nine national broadcast and cable networks, drew almost four million viewers more than President Bush's 2006 address (45.5 million, compared with 41.7 million). Despite the overall increase, the Fox News channel drew its smallest audience for a State of the Union by Mr. Bush, off nearly two million viewers from a year ago (4.6 million, compared with 6.5 million). Fox News's coverage remained first among cable channels, but No. 2 CNN saw a slight increase (to 2.4 million from 2.2 million) and No. 3 MSNBC's audience more than doubled, to 1.6 million viewers from 707,000.

            "text": "  Fiesta Bowl coverage of Boise State's dramatic overtime victory over Oklahoma on Monday gave Fox a ratings victory for the night, but CBS's lineup of repeats trailed close behind. According to Nielsen's preliminary estimates, which do not account for discrepancies across time zones, approximately 14 million viewers tuned in during prime-time hours to watch the game, which kicked off at 8:53 p.m. and lasted until 12:51 a.m. CBS was second for the night in total viewers, getting a boost at 9 from ''Two and a Half Men'' (12.1 million) and at 10 from ''CSI: Miami'' (12.1 million). Among adults 18 to 49, ABC appeared to edge out CBS for second place, dominating the 8 p.m. hour because of an overrun of its afternoon football coverage of the Rose Bowl. Later in the night, however, repeats of ABC's ''Supernanny'' at 9 (6.7 million) and 10 (6.9 million) ranked a distant third. NBC was fourth over all with a marathon of ''Heroes'' repeats, which drew 5.5 million viewers at 8, 5.2 million at 9 and 4.6 million at 10.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

According to Nielsen's estimate, NBC's ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' garnered 13.4 million viewers at 9 p.m., the show's largest audience in more than a year. NBC also dominated the 10 p.m. hour with ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (15.1 million), which drew the night's highest ratings. NBC's ''Dateline'' (9.5 million) ranked second in the 8 p.m. hour. Meanwhile Orange Bowl coverage of Louisville's win over Wake Forest appeared to give Fox an edge over CBS for No. 2 for the night. The game averaged 10.6 million viewers according to time-zone adjusted estimates. CBS received relatively strong ratings for repeats of ''NCIS'' at 8 (13 million) and ''The Unit'' at 9 (9.1 million), but a rerun of ''Numb3rs,'' which is usually broadcast on Fridays, earned 6.7 million viewers at 10. ABC finished fourth with repeats of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' at 8 (8.1 million) and ''Boston Legal'' at 10 (5 million), as well as two new episodes of ''Big Day'' at 9 (5.2 million) and 9:30 (4.8 million).

Brad Grey, the head of Paramount Studios, argued that he deserved credit for his role in putting the film together, but the producers' branch of the academy, which decides who can accept the Oscar as the producer of the best-picture winner, determined on Thursday night that only Graham King was eligible. The same group decided that of the five people who have received credit for producing ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' another best-picture contender, only David T. Friendly, Peter Saraf and Marc Turtletaub can come to the stage to pick up the award should the film win. The Academy Awards will take place on Feb. 25.

            "text": "  On the night of President Bush's State of the Union address, the ''American Idol'' judges kicked off prime time in Memphis with imposing ratings as usual. According to Nielsen's estimates, which do not account for time zone discrepancies due to interruptions for the president's live speech, the series yielded 31.2 million viewers in the 8 p.m. hour Tuesday, significantly ahead of second place ''NCIS'' on CBS (14.3 million). As a result, Fox retained a substantial lead going into State of the Union programming at 9. Ratings for the 49-minute address weren't immediately available, but preliminary approximations show Fox's coverage on top, followed by NBC and CBS in a close race for second, and ABC in fourth. On Sunday, ''Ocean's Deadliest,'' the documentary Steve Irwin was filming when he was killed, attracted 3.2 million viewers. It was carried on two cable channels, Discovery (1.7 million) and Animal Planet (1.5 million), from 8 p.m. to 9:30.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

            "text": "  The Golden Globes, an awards dance that takes great care to make sure everybody has a place at the table, finessed an almost perfect result on Monday night. At nearly all the various after-parties here studio chieftains had something to cheer about, which is just the way the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which administers the ceremony, likes it.  This is less about guile or calculation than about the imperatives of fandom. The 84 or so members of the association are, first and foremost, cheerleaders for the movie industry and the stars that give it light. They spend the year going to private screenings and intimate dinners, bumping knees with the likes of Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson. It is possible that they begin to think of these movie titans as friends: friends they don't want to disappoint.  Remember that preschool graduation at which everyone got an award for something and parents left feeling validated that their pride and joy was in some way special? Monday night felt a bit like that. The people behind ''Dreamgirls,'' in need of a win if only to quiet the chattering class of Oscar watchers who were suggesting that the film had broken stride on the way to the podium, had much to be happy about.  ''This movie still has plenty of gas,'' said Laurence Mark, a producer of the film.  With victories in the supporting actor categories for Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, and the award for best comedy/musical, ''Dreamgirls,'' a film that seemed conceived and executed with an embedded Oscar strategy, is still very much alive and in the hunt for best picture at the Academy Awards. Having not been tested by ''Babel'' or ''The Departed,'' which were in a separate dramatic category, ''Dreamgirls'' is perhaps not the favorite, but its backers can work from their new position.  '' 'Dreamgirls' will win tonight because it has to,'' said a former studio head as he walked up the red carpet on Monday night, asking not to be identified because, he said, he worried he would upset other competitors.  Upset them? When all was said and done, they didn't have much to be upset about. ''The Departed'' might have missed the big prize, but the best directing award brought Martin Scorsese to the podium and gave Warner Brothers a good story to tell on the way to the Oscars.  The backers of ''Babel,'' with seven nominations, spent the night practicing their wan, frozen smiles as they missed out on category after category. But at the very end of the ceremony, a nice, big lifesaver appeared: the award for best dramatic picture.  ''I was just jumping,'' said Rinko Kikuchi, the young Japanese star of ''Babel,'' speaking for many people at Paramount Vantage, which produced the film. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, a director who happens to look like a movie star, got a big full-on kiss from John Lesher, the young and fairly new president of Vantage, who bet early and hard that audiences, and awards, would show up for this triptych of a movie that spans borders and languages.  ''The Queen'' might not have taken home gold for best picture, but its star, Helen Mirren, had enough hardware at the end of the night that she looked as if she'd spent time at Home Depot. Her regal march to an Oscar for best actress will apparently crush (daintily, perhaps) everything in its path.  On the red carpet, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, who was dealt what she said she felt was the role of a lifetime in ''Volver,'' said she didn't mind. ''I don't think it's going to happen this year, and I am really O.K. with that,'' she said of her own chances. ''I am still very much hoping for Pedro.''  Ms. Cruz had a letter in her pocket from the director of ''Volver,'' Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who was home sick with the flu, but the letter remained folded because the prize for best foreign language film went to Clint Eastwood, a longtime crush of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, who had been nominated for best director -- twice -- and seemed plenty pleased by the recognition he received for ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' the companion film in Japanese he made after putting together the much larger ''Flags of Our Fathers.''  ''I guess I better learn some languages,'' he joked in the press room after the show.  That's the Golden Globes. Oscar hopes for all -- and no one gets hurt in the process.  NEWS ANALYSIS  ",

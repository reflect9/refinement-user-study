            "text": "  Which children like school the most? Asians and girls and the children of parents who are married, make the most money, have advanced academic degrees and live in the suburbs of the Northeast.  Those are also likely to be the same students who say they are most interested in their schoolwork and often work hard in school.  Which are most likely to be enrolled in programs for gifted students? Children of better-educated parents. If one imagined a category combining the leading factors, it would be the daughters of married couples from the suburbs in the South whose parents' income was above the poverty level.  Those are some of the findings in the Census Bureau's analysis, ''A Child's Day,'' released this month. The report surveyed parents nationwide to analyze benchmarks of well-being for 73 million children under 18 from a 2003 review of income and participation in various government assistance programs.  The report also measured characteristics of students enrolled in gifted programs. Among students younger than 12 enrolled in such programs, the largest group was non-Hispanic white. Among older students, Asians were the most numerous in gifted programs.  The biggest differential was linked to their parents' level of educational achievement. The proportion of 12- to- 17-year-olds in gifted classes ranged from 10 percent of those whose parents had never completed high school to 45 percent of those whose parents had an advanced degree.  Many of the differentials in the report were predictable, on the basis of other surveys, and were relatively slight. Still, some stood out.  Among racial and ethnic groups, non-Hispanic white parents were most likely to say their children never like school, while Asian parents, followed by Hispanic parents, were most likely to say their children like it often. The children of parents who were separated, divorced or widowed were most likely to never like school. Children whose parent worked part-time generally like school most often. Those growing up in rural areas like it less often.  More parents of Asian and non-Hispanic white teenagers said their children had repeated a grade. The percentage who had ever been suspended -- 13.4 percent overall -- barely differed regardless of race, income and other variables.  ",

            "text": "  Thirty-nine Long Island schools failed to meet targets for bringing their students to proficiency under state and federal guidelines in the 2005-6 school year, the State Education Department said last week. Many of the schools are in advanced stages of corrective action, including restructuring, because they have failed for a number of years, but five are new to the list.  At the same time, 10 schools on the Island, including high schools in Westbury and South Huntington, improved their performance enough to return to good standing.  Schools are declared in need of improvement if enough of their students do not meet proficiency standards on tests in English and mathematics in elementary, middle and secondary schools. For the first time, schools were judged on scores of students in grades 3, 5, 6 and 7, in addition to grades 4, 8 and 11.  Not only must schools show improvement over all, they must also meet achievement targets for component groups, including racial categories and special education.  Four Suffolk County schools -- Paca Middle School in the William Floyd district, Mulligan and Cordello Avenue schools in Central Islip, and Hemlock Elementary in Brentwood -- are new to the list of schools needing improvement. So is Fulton School in Hempstead in Nassau County.  Among the 10 schools removed from the failing list were Walt Whitman High School and Henry L. Stimson Middle School in South Huntington. ''We analyzed the warning signs of students that were not doing well, and we analyzed the exam, and we put in place practices to get those kids remediated,'' Superintendent Thomas Shea said. ''I like to say we've narrowed the cracks in the system.''  FORD FESSENDEN  THE WEEK  ",

            "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''The Incredibles'' (Education Life, Jan. 7):  All of the 13 Advanced Placement courses I took at my comprehensive public high school required more work than most of the classes I have experienced in four years at Yale, and there were plenty of primary documents to go around.  The difference between high-powered high schools like those mentioned in the article (merely 68 schools supplied over 20 percent of Yale's 2006 freshman class) and mine, where the college counselor had not heard of the top-ranked liberal arts colleges where I applied, is not academic; it's social.  Many classmates from schools like Andover and Dalton arrive at college fighting to get into the most selective major and singing group and, later, the best law school and investment bank -- realms that preserve the ''I'll take you down'' moral certitude they learned in high school. That the viability of this culture of competitiveness is limited to these few domains comes as a surprise to some of them.  Phoebe Rounds  Rochester, Jan. 8, 2007  ",

            "text": "  Children of women with less than a high school education are more likely to have received timely childhood vaccinations than the children of college graduates, according to a new study.  The paper, published online Dec. 28, will appear in the February issue of The American Journal of Public Health. Scientists studied data on 11,860 families from the National Immunization Survey, a nationwide survey of vaccination among children 19 to 35 months old that includes information on race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.  Children of mothers who had not completed high school were 16 percent more likely to have up-to-date vaccinations than children of college graduates. While black children were 11 percent less likely to be up to date than white children, Hispanic children were 11 percent more likely. The poorest children, without considering race or ethnicity, were just as likely as the richest to have completed their vaccination schedule.  ''The way the health care system is organized for immunization services may account for the variations,'' said Jennie J. Kronenfeld, the senior author of the study. ''Or cultural differences may overcome the barriers to immunization that they don't in other kinds of health care.''  Dr. Kronenfeld, a professor of sociology in the School of Social and Family Dynamics at Arizona State University, offered a possible explanation for the difference between the children of college graduates and those of mothers who had not graduated from high school. ''There is a controversy among more educated mothers about the safety of certain kinds of immunization,'' she said. ''That may be part of what is going on here, but we don't know for sure.''

            "text": "  On a recent cold Saturday, when most children around the city were relaxing after a week at school, 320 boys and girls, ages 10 to 13, filed into Nightingale-Bamford, a private girls' school in a stately brick building on the Upper East Side.  The children, most black or Hispanic, were going to be interviewed for a shot at admission to a private day or boarding school, or an elite suburban public school, through A Better Chance, a nonprofit group. The boys wore jackets and neckties. The girls were in prim skirts or nicely pressed trousers. Some were confident, but many were nervous, folding and unfolding their hands, sitting up extra straight as they waited to be interviewed. The stakes, after all, were high.  The program's mission is to increase the number of minority men and women in leadership positions. It is really about social mobility, whisking children out of their environment in urban neighborhoods and transporting them to institutions that are incubators for presidents, senators and titans of industry -- like Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., President Bush's alma mater.  ''These schools are pathways to influence and power in our society,'' said Sandra Simmons, the president of the group, pointing out that Governor-elect Deval L. Patrick of Massachusetts, the state's first black governor, is an alumnus of the program.  Yet A Better Chance and similar programs, like the New York City-based Prep for Prep, can only hope to provide mobility for the few. Most of the children who seek placement will never get a spot. In 2006, for example, 2,153 students nationwide applied to A Better Chance; about half passed the screening process, but only 624 children were accepted and 455 enrolled. The others declined their spots, largely for financial reasons, group officials said.  The former president of the group, Judith Berry Griffin, worried so much about talented students who had been rejected that she left the organization in 2003 and established a new nonprofit group, Pathways to College, to help them.  THE fact, she said, is that most public middle schools serving urban youth simply are not preparing children for academically challenging high schools, public or private. Even if they were, there are not many seats available in the elite private schools, or enough scholarship money to support the students who need financial aid, she said.  ''There are just not enough places,'' she said in a telephone interview from her office in Englewood, N.J. ''It's like musical chairs. We simply have to come to grips with the fact that we are throwing away hundreds of thousands of talented children. We don't even know what talent we are throwing away.''  Rather than helping a few students get coveted spots in a few schools, she now tries to help children in low-performing public high schools, like Barringer in Newark, get the skills they need to attend college by offering after-school writing courses and college guidance. ''My real goal is to bring about systemic change in the public schools,'' she said.  Ms. Simmons acknowledged the limitations of her program in being able to help only a small number of children. But, she said, it still has great impact because it vaults talented students of color to the highest echelons of society.  At the Nightingale-Bamford school, Kirk Cohall, 10, waited for his interview with his sister, Shannon, 14, and their parents. Their mother, Sophia, left her job as a financial analyst to spend more time with the family; their father, Kirkpatrick, is the senior minister at the Lenox Road Baptist Church in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Shannon, who was accepted as A Better Chance scholar last year, is a ninth grader at Poly Prep Country Day School, a mostly white school in Bay Ridge. Kirk, a fifth grader in a gifted program at Public School 279, a mostly black school in Canarsie, is hoping to join his sister there.  Kirk and Shannon's parents say the quality of public schools in Canarsie has declined in recent years as the neighborhood changed from mostly white to mostly black. P.S. 279 still posts high test scores, but it is badly overcrowded. Some children attend classes in an annex a few blocks away, and some classes are as large as 32 pupils. Several years ago, the school had a leaky roof and moldy classroom walls.  David Cantor, a spokesman for the city's Department of Education, said overcrowding and adequate maintenance were issues citywide, acknowledging that some classes at P.S. 279 have 32 students.  Poly Prep has a 25-acre campus, protected by a gate. It has a whole building dedicated to the study of science; one floor has physics labs, another has chemistry labs, and two floors have biology labs. The school has a professional-looking theater for student productions. It even has a pond with ducks -- 262 by one count.  ''You can sit around the pond and do your homework,'' Shannon said. ''It doesn't look like you're in Brooklyn. There's grass and trees. It's getting a breath of fresh air in the middle of the city.'' But what struck her most is the class size. ''There are 10 students in the class and you get lots of individual attention.''  Shannon was also accepted at Bronx High School of Science, but declined the spot because, her parents said, it was too far from home, and, with classes of 34 students, too crowded. Her parents pay part of Poly Prep's $27,000 a year tuition, and a scholarship from the school pays the rest.  Shannon's father, who has a Ph.D. in education from Fordham University, said graduates of A Better Chance can be agents for change. ''We want a better life for our children, of course,'' he said. But, he added, ''We're teaching them, whatever God wants you to do, you take it to help others.''  Mrs. Cohall, who attended public schools in Brooklyn, said she had always been a proponent of public education, but was worried about the quality of most public schools in black neighborhoods. ''The expectations are low and the resources are limited,'' she said.  ''If the playing field were level, we wouldn't need this program,'' she continued, referring to A Better Chance.  ''I think these kids are going to help to level it,'' Shannon's father added.  ON EDUCATION Clara Hemphill, a guest columnist, is author of ''New York City's Best Public High Schools.'' Samuel G. Freedman is on vacation.  Correction:  January 4, 2007, Thursday  The On Education column yesterday, about A Better Chance, a nonprofit group that helps minority children apply to private day and boarding high schools, misstated the surname of the president of the group and omitted her middle initial.

            "text": "  When John Smith, a swaggering sixth grader at one of New York City's growing collection of kindergarten- through eighth-grade schools, feels lost, he heads downstairs to the colorful classroom of his former third-grade teacher, Randi Silverman, for what she calls a ''Silverman hug.''  ''When I get mad I go to her,'' John, 11, said amid the lunchtime buzz in the cafeteria of his school, Public School 105, on the Rockaway peninsula in Queens. ''When I feel frustrated I'll go to her. When I feel like I can't do it no more I go to her, and she tells me I have to do it.''  Miles away at Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, a 6th- through 12th-grade school, teachers keep the sixth graders looking forward, toward college. One recent morning, a class peppered a guidance counselor, Michael Lloyd, with queries, from ''Where is Harvard?'' to ''What does Ph.D. stand for?''  The two schools, in disparate corners of the nation's largest school system, are part of a national effort to rethink middle school, driven by increasingly well-documented slumps in learning among early adolescents as well as middle school crime rates and stubborn high school dropout rates.  The schools share the premise that the way to reverse years of abysmal middle school performance is to get rid of middle schools entirely. But they represent opposite poles in the sharp debate over whether 11- through 13-year-olds are better off pushed toward adulthood or coddled a little longer.  Should the nurturing cocoon of elementary school be extended for another three years, shielding 11-year-olds from the abrupt transition to a new school, with new students and teachers, at one of the most volatile times in their lives?  Paul Vallas, chief executive of the Philadelphia school system, thinks so, and he has closed 17 traditional middle schools since 2002, while converting some three dozen elementary schools into K-8s. ''The fifth to sixth grade transition is just too traumatic,'' he said. ''At a time when children are undergoing emotional, physical, social changes, and when they need stability and consistency, suddenly they're thrust into this alien environment.''  Others argue that 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds thrive in the presence of older role models and reminders of concrete goals, like playing varsity sports and getting into college.  ''Kids are forward-looking -- they don't get nostalgic for second grade when they're in third grade,'' said Larry Woodbridge, principal of the Secondary School for Law in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where the award-winning high school debate team will teach a middle school social studies unit this spring.  K-8 schools, which prevailed 100 years ago, are the more popular alternative in this debate, cropping up from Philadelphia to Baltimore to Milwaukee to New York. (In New York, which has more than 200,000 sixth- through eighth-grade pupils, most are in traditional 6-8 schools.)  But it is not clear that the shift back into elementary schools makes much of a difference in keeping students from losing their way academically.  Researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that students at Philadelphia's established K-8 schools outperformed students at traditional middle schools, but that those schools had fewer poor and minority students and more experienced teachers, which could have largely explained the results.  In Philadelphia's newer K-8s, which are more similar demographically to the city's middle schools, students performed slightly better than at middle schools, but those advantages were not always statistically significant.  ''The bump in student achievement that administrators may achieve in converting to K-8s may not make as big a difference as they would hope for,'' said Vaughan Byrnes, one of the Johns Hopkins researchers.  The 6th- through 12th-grade school is less common, and less studied. In New York City, where such schools have proliferated -- 38 have opened since 2002 -- the shift is being driven largely by nonprofit organizations that have helped start new, small schools. These schools are under pressure to show they can produce better results than traditional ones.  In many ways these schools were conceived less as a solution to the middle school problem than as solutions to the high school problem -- that is, the problem of having just four years to work magic with woefully underprepared freshmen.  ''It's been an amazingly difficult foot race to get kids from where they are coming in at ninth grade to college-ready, and I just wanted more time,'' said Richard Kahan, president of the Urban Assembly, a city nonprofit group that started creating high schools and has since switched to 6-12 schools, hoping to open three more in September.  Both 6-12 and K-8 schools eliminate one transition from students' lives. Both also tend to have far fewer sixth- through eighth-grade students than the typical middle school -- a difference that those who work with middle school students say cannot be underestimated.  ''One middle school student is like three high school students in terms of their behavioral needs and the issues you're confronted with,'' said Fred Walsh, principal of the School for International Studies in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.  Mr. Walsh said he spent more time dealing with his 170 middle school students, like a sixth-grade boy who recently broke into tears after his science teacher asked him to switch seats, than his 300 high schoolers.  Still, some middle school experts argue that school reconfiguration is a costly distraction from what adolescents really need: smaller classes, an engaging curriculum, personalized attention and well-prepared teachers. ''Creating schools with varying grade configurations, K-8s and 6-12s, will not guarantee that middle-grades teachers and students will be successful,'' said Patrick Montesano, who runs a national middle school improvement program at the Academy for Educational Development, a nonprofit organization.  Experts are not the only skeptics. Mr. Woodbridge often finds himself on the defensive among parents terrified to send their fifth graders into the same hallways as high school seniors. And when P.S. 105 was converted from an elementary school into a K-8, some teachers balked at the thought of pubescent preteens in the same school as kindergartners. Indeed, P.S. 105 starts even earlier, with a prekindergarten program.  But many have since come around, sometimes after seeing how their former students return to them for comfort or advice. When a seventh-grader had the shock of getting her first menstrual period during school one day, she turned to her third-grade teacher, Bonnie Petrone, who welcomed her to womanhood in a classroom decorated with snowflakes and smiley faces.  ''It's a comfort zone,'' Mrs. Petrone explained.  When a student cut school and left the building last year, his absence was noticed more quickly than it might have been in middle school, and a half-dozen staff members searched the neighborhood and worked the phones before tracking him down at home.  ''They know me -- my house, my rules,'' said Laurie Shapiro, the principal, explaining why such offenses are a rarity.  As for her students, Katty Martinez, 15, relishes being a role model ''to the little ones.'' Christopher Pike, 8, gets to watch his brother, Marques, 14, play basketball in the school gym.  While the first day of sixth grade can be stomach-churning when a transition to a new school full of strangers is involved, for Kendearia Kingston and Taaliba Chalmers, it was no more traumatic than any other first day of school. The girls, now seventh graders, said their lives were complicated enough without switching schools. ''There's a lot of issues going on,'' Kendearia, 12, said.  ''Boyfriend issues,'' Taaliba, 13, elaborated.  But Cal Lopez, 11, said that being in the same school with prekindergartners made him ''feel like a baby.'' And Anthony Kuar, a fifth grader, said he was ready to move on from P.S. 105, where crayon renditions of snowmen line a hallway, the principal's office is packed with Winnie the Pooh knickknacks, and middle school students switch classes -- but mostly within one wing of the third floor.  ''I want my own locker, with a combination,'' Anthony, 11, groused.  At Frederick Douglass Academy, by contrast, the walls are lined with posters of university campuses, photographs of last year's senior prom, and gold-trimmed sheets of paper listing where each member of the Class of 2006 was admitted to college (the standout: Breeana Moore, who settled on Brown after being admitted to 25 others).  ''I can absolutely get all these kids to college if I have them for seven years,'' said the principal, Gregory Hodge. ''The school is geared toward one thing: getting your students into college, and it starts in grade six.''  Teachers say students who enter Frederick Douglass as ninth graders, after middle school elsewhere, are often behind academically and chafe at aspects of the school culture, like being called ''Mr.'' and ''Miss'' and having to wear navy blue and white uniforms every day.  Antonia Singleton, 18, said the uniform was easy to digest as a sixth grader, because ''your mom is still dressing you at that time.'' By ninth grade, she said, it was just part of life.  In the cafeteria one recent day, the age chasm was evident. As Kabresha Glover, 11, giggled with her friends over Cheez-its and chicken fingers -- ''There's a lot of drama in the sixth grade,'' she noted -- Jack Boampong, 17, and his friends debated the execution of Saddam Hussein.  While the models differ, in both P.S. 105 and Frederick Douglass, the principals have spent hours orchestrating schedules, staffing and traffic patterns to ensure that contact between their oldest and youngest students is limited, and supervised.  When Frederick Douglass teachers noticed an 11th grade boy and an 8th grade girl holding hands, ''We nipped that in the bud,'' Dr. Hodge said, adding, ''You also have to make sure they emulate the right behavior.''  And so, when a $100,000 college scholarship winner was congratulated on the Frederick Douglass loudspeaker in the middle of John DePasquale's English class, he briefly stopped his lesson.  ''In five years,'' he told his seventh-grade charges, ''I want to hear your name.''

            "text": "  Compared with a decade ago, America's children appear to be marginally better off, according to a Census Bureau analysis. More are performing at grade level in school, more are taking lessons after class and on weekends and more parents -- especially in black households -- are imposing limits on television viewing.  And, by a small margin, more children under 6 are eating breakfast with at least one parent.  On the other hand, better educated and wealthier parents were generally less likely than other parents to have dinner with their children, once the children turn 6.  The Census Bureau report, titled ''A Child's Day,'' surveyed parents to analyze benchmarks of well-being for 73 million children from a 2003 review of income and participation in various government assistance programs. It compared some of the findings with results from similar surveys in 1994 and 2000.  ''We hadn't noted anything where children were doing worse,'' said Tallese Johnson, an author of the report.  Many of the results were left to half-empty, half-full ambiguities, and some seemed, perhaps, sugar-coated. For example, 47 percent of parents said they never felt angry with their children. Only 5 percent said their children often behaved in ways that bothered them a lot.  About 7 in 10 children under 6 were praised by a parent three or more times a day, but that declined to half of children 6 to 11 and a little more than 1 in 3 among 12- to 17-year-olds.  Parents of 7 in 10 children under 6, about half of 6- to 11-year-olds and about 4 in 10 children 12 to 17 said they played with or talked to their children just for fun for at least five minutes several times a day.  Non-Hispanic white parents were more likely to spend that kind of time, except when it came to teenagers. And generally, teenagers were praised less often than younger children, regardless of their parents' race, ethnicity, educational attainment or occupation.  Ms. Johnson and her co-author, Jane Lawler Dye, found a few improvements in child well-being compared with a decade earlier. The number of children considered ''on track'' academically increased to 75 percent, from 69 percent in 1994.  Also, the number of parents imposing rules for television viewing increased. Rules making certain programs off-limits and regulating viewing time by time of day and total hours were imposed on 54 percent of 3- to 5-year-olds in 1994, compared with 67 percent in 2003. Comparable numbers among 6- to 11-year-olds increased to 68 percent from 60 percent, and to 44 percent from 40 percent among 12- to 17-year-olds.  ''It's good news that more parents are restricting TV viewing because we know that children who watch a lot of TV are more likely to be obese,'' said Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. ''We know that black children spend more hours watching television than other children. Parents who live in dangerous neighborhoods seem to use television viewing as a way to keep their children safe at home.''  Parents who imposed no viewing rules were also least likely to have read to their young children (although there appeared to be no correlation between television rules and grade-level performance).  Most children have dinner each night with at least one parent, but not breakfast. Fifty-seven percent of children under age 6 have breakfast every day with at least one parent (up from 51 percent in 1998), but that drops to fewer than one-third among 6- to 11-year-olds and fewer than one-fourth among children 12 to 17.  Nearly 4 in 10 children (and more than half of black children) have been in regular child care, a situation that is more common when parents, regardless of race, are better educated and wealthier.  But racial and ethnic disparities persist, according to the report.  Children in wealthier households were about twice as likely to be enrolled in school programs for gifted students than those living in poverty.  ''It does underscore the pervasiveness of disadvantage of certain groups in every-day life,'' said William O'Hare, a senior fellow with the Kids Count project at the Annie E. Casey Foundation.  Hispanic children were least likely to have been read to by their parents. More than 1 in 5, Hispanic children ages 1 to 2 were not regularly read to. But Hispanic children liked school most often, while non-Hispanic whites were most likely to never have liked school. Nearly 1 in 5 black 12- to 17-year-olds had repeated a grade, and almost the same proportion had been expelled or suspended from school at some point, compared with about 1 in 10 among all children.  But children of wealthier parents were more likely than most other children to have repeated a grade and just as likely to have been suspended.  All parents said they wanted or expected their children to attend college, and they all set higher goals for their children's schooling after college than they expected the children to meet.  Hispanic children under 18 in central cities were most likely to be kept home as much as possible because their neighborhoods were perceived as dangerous; the same was true for more than 1 in 3 black children and 1 in 4 non-Hispanic whites.  Those disparities extend to the suburbs, where 33 percent of Hispanic children, 25 percent of blacks and 15 percent of whites are generally kept at home. In rural areas, 34 percent of black children were most likely to be kept home as much as possible.  ",

            "text": "  A coalition of community groups is calling for the city Department of Education to develop a ''Marshall Plan for middle-grade schools,'' saying that all too often, the sixth through eighth grades become ''pathways to failure.''  In a report scheduled to be released at a news conference today, the coalition calls for a rigorous curriculum with advanced course offerings in all middle schools, classes of no more than 20 students each, and the creation of a new position within the department: a deputy chancellor who would focus on ''ensuring proper coordination and alignment'' among middle schools, high schools, college and the working world.  Noting that city middle school teachers tend to be less experienced than their elementary and high school counterparts, and are more likely to teach outside their license area, the report also calls for more teacher mentoring programs, as well as ''new incentive strategies'' to attract and retain qualified middle school teachers and principals.  The report was prepared by the community involvement program of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform, at Brown University, for an assortment of parent and community groups calling themselves the New York City Coalition for Educational Justice.  ''Middle schools have been relatively ignored in reform efforts in the city, but they're crucial,'' said Norm Fruchter, director of the community involvement program. ''You're not going to get good high school outcomes without paying attention to middle schools.''  David Cantor, a spokesman for the Education Department, said in a statement that the department considered the middle school years ''of critical importance.''  He said the department had put in place ''serious and lasting'' reform efforts, including the addition of $40 million yearly for struggling middle school students, closing failing middle schools, creating K-8 and 6th- through 12th-grade schools, and carving large middle schools into ''small learning communities.''

My oldest child (then 2) qualified for Medicaid while my husband and I were both in graduate school. It seemed that families on Medicaid were the target demographic for every public health campaign, especially immunization, and we were flooded with information. With our second child, we had private insurance, and public health information has been minimal.  Marcie Francis  Bloomington, Ind.  ",

            "text": "  EACH week last fall, those enamored of the Rutgers University football team waited eagerly for the USA Today and Associated Press polls to see how high their Scarlet Knights had climbed.  Though the football team made it to No. 7 at one point, that paled before the ratings the honchos of Kant and Hegel and Wittgenstein across campus received in the Philosophical Gourmet Report. In the 2006 Gourmet Report rankings of graduate philosophy departments nationwide, Rutgers was No. 2, behind New York University and ahead of Princeton, which tied for No. 3 with Michigan.  ''I guess the old academic joke is that mathematicians are the second- cheapest department to finance, since they only need pencils, paper and a wastebasket,'' said Peter Klein, a philosophy professor and the acting executive vice dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at Rutgers. ''Philosophers are even cheaper, since they don't even use the wastebasket.''  The two colleges that played the first football game back in 1869 -- Rutgers and Princeton -- are now atop the world of epistemology and metaphysics. When you add in N.Y.U. and Columbia, which was tied for No. 10 in the rankings with North Carolina at Chapel Hill, could there be something in the air around here that attracts Aristotelian mind-sets?  ''I do think that at a certain point, there is the desire for philosophers to find other good philosophers nearby, plus there was a great desire for intellectuals to live in Manhattan when it was reviving in the 1990s,'' said Brian Leiter, a University of Texas professor, who attended Princeton and who started the ratings 17 years ago when he was a 26-year-old wondering where the best philosophers in academia were. ''Princeton was always a good department, as was Columbia, but special circumstances have brought Rutgers and N.Y.U. up to that standard.''  Brian McLaughlin, the chairman of the Rutgers philosophy department, said that in the 1980s the university consolidated its various colleges' philosophy departments at the same time it was endowing what it called World Class Scholar Leader chairs. The department moved more quickly than other departments to ask for funds and was able to hire several good new professors.  ''Like I said, it was cheaper than funding a physics lab: All we needed was a salary and an office, so the administration was supportive,'' said Dr. Klein, who was the department chairman part of that time.  As the department's reputation grew, along with the knowledge that there was money for new hires, more and more top graduate students came to Rutgers.  A similar thing happened at N.Y.U., Dr. Leiter said, with administrators lavishing money on humanities departments that required few physical elements. They also gave subsidies for Manhattan housing -- ''a huge draw for anyone,'' he said.  By 2002, Rutgers was ranked No. 1, along with N.Y.U. and Princeton; in 2004, it was No. 2, behind N.Y.U. and ahead of Princeton.  While most in the field agree that Princeton, Rutgers and N.Y.U. are top philosophy departments, there is some carping about whether philosophy departments should be ranked like football teams. The American Philosophical Association says that it ''does not rank departments of philosophy and their graduate and/or undergraduate programs nor does it sponsor, endorse, approve or encourage any national rankings.''  Dr. Leiter solicits recommendations from about 300 professors every two years to get his ratings, but critics say his raters are skewed toward analytic philosophy -- the branch that emphasizes current, rather than historical, philosophy.  Dr. McLaughlin said that Rutgers is better in analytic philosophy -- things like philosophy of the mind and language -- while Princeton excels in more historic areas.  Some universities known to have good departments, like Penn State, Stony Brook and Vanderbilt, do not participate in the ratings.  ''Schools like Rutgers and N.Y.U. emphasize analytic philosophy, and most of the evaluators emphasize that, so schools like Vanderbilt and Northwestern and Penn State, which don't, aren't going to do as well,'' said John J. Stuhr, a philosophy professor at Vanderbilt. ''It's like asking about the best painters of all time. If you asked Cubists, you would get a list of Cubists; Impressionists, the same thing. I'm sure Rutgers has a good department. It just doesn't emphasize what we do.''  Even at Rutgers, some are skeptical. ''We are a society that is great for rankings, horse races, polls,'' said Bruce W. Wilshire, a philosophy professor at the college for 37 years. ''I'm not sure what anything like this does for us. I'm sure some people think it is nice, but it seems like in philosophy, we should not be emphasizing this sort of thing.''  Still, Dr. McLaughlin said that to the extent that people look at ratings, it has been good for Rutgers to be at the top. Because most graduate departments have only 6 to 12 new students a year, the competition for the best ones is great, and now Rutgers is getting its share.  ''That only helps the undergrads taking courses, too,'' Dr. McLaughlin said, noting that last year about 5,200 Rutgers undergraduates took philosophy courses, many taught by graduate students. ''These are now grad students who will be teaching at Yale or Michigan, top places, in a few years. We have been able to place 100 percent of our grad students in teaching jobs, where the national average is about 60 percent.  ''Leiter ratings or no, that says lots about how Rutgers is viewed, a real positive thing.''  ",

The study found that, while older girls use such sites the most, older boys are more likely to meet new people through them. Sixty percent of older boys, for example, say they use the sites to make new friends, while only 46 percent of older girls do. And older boys are more than twice as likely to say they use the sites to flirt.  ''Older boys are much more expansive in their use of the sites,'' said Amanda Lenhart, one of the study's two authors. ''I believe that it has a lot to do with socialization. A lot of the media messages about safety tend to be aimed more at girls than boys.''  The study was conducted over a month last fall, through telephone interviews with households with minor children, who were identified from random calls over the last three years. The data was weighted to be nationally representative in terms of sex, age, education, race and other factors.  ALEX MINDLIN  DRILLING DOWN  ",

            "text": "  QUIZ yourself:  One American history course gets at pre-Civil War tensions through primary source readings, including William Lloyd Garrison's editorial from The Liberator in 1831 and Abraham Lincoln's ''House Divided'' speech. A second American history course leans on primary sources, too. Students parse each Supreme Court justice's opinion in the 1857 Dred Scott decision as well as texts of the first and second Lincoln-Douglas debates. Students must also demonstrate knowledge of historic maps.  So which is college and which is high school? Which is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and which Dalton, the private K-12 school on Manhattan's East Side? If you can't tell, you can see why students who graduate from high-powered high schools experience academic d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu even at elite colleges and universities. (The first course is M.I.T.'s, the second Dalton's.)  ''My first two semesters at Brown, I was shopping for science classes, and I would be in a bio class or a chem class and think, 'I learned this in high school,' '' says Carly Rush, a Brown junior who graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a public magnet school in Alexandria, Va., where ''you would know your G.P.A. to the fourth digit'' (hers was 3.931).  Ms. Rush's experience echoes the new reality for high-achieving students: work crazy-hard in high school and cruise in college. In high school, they pile on the college-level Advanced Placement courses, face reading lists that can't realistically be completed and tackle complex, advanced ideas once reserved for undergraduates. ''The high-end students have greatly expanded their preparation and their exposure to the life of the mind and scholarship,'' says John C. Bravman, vice provost for undergraduate education at Stanford. ''This has been a huge change, especially in the last decade.''  In past eras, good high schools provided the educational foundation for an intellectual awakening in college. But for the mostly affluent students in private and competitive public schools -- from T.J. (as Thomas Jefferson is known) to urban intellectual cocoons like Bronx Science and Stuyvesant -- high school has become the defining academic experience. The much-touted leap to higher education has become more of a lateral step, or even a letdown.  ''Our students find college not as challenging,'' says Temba Maqubela, dean of faculty and assistant head for academics at Phillips Academy, the boarding school in Andover, Mass. Former students have written to him expressing frustration with college courses that are too basic. (Consider this collegiate-sounding offering from Andover's English department: ''Feasts and Fools: The Topos of the Festive Social Gathering.'') Andover alumni tell John Rogers, dean of studies, that college ''is not as difficult as their experience here,'' he says.  Jeff Zhou, a freshman at M.I.T., for example, would appear to have a killer schedule, with philosophy, physics, chemistry and multivariable calculus. But Mr. Zhou, a lanky water polo player from Buffalo, N.Y., dressed in baggy jeans, a natty black and white zip top and leather flip-flops, sinks into a chair in M.I.T.'s student center and looks sheepish as he pulls his orange spiral chemistry notebook from his backpack. In two weeks, he has taken only four pages of notes. ''Most of the material so far,'' he says, ''for me has been review.''  ''I'm probably not having as hard a time as I should be,'' says Mr. Zhou, who graduated last spring from Andover having earned 4s and 5s on 10 Advanced Placement tests and completed three years of chemistry, including organic chemistry. At M.I.T., he has time for water polo, Frisbee, surfing (yes, in New England) and even television. ''I've started watching 'The Office' and 'Family Guy,' '' he says.  It's not that M.I.T. has eased up.  Regina Goldman, a junior at Yale, says the 538 pages of course readings for her upper-level seminar in American studies is less than what she was assigned for ''Constructing America,'' a required history course at Riverdale Country School in the Bronx. ''The workload was absolutely more than I've had to do here,'' says Ms. Goldman, whose typical high school day began with a 6:15 a.m. swim practice and ended about 1 a.m. with homework.  The course description for ''Constructing America'' even cautions: ''The demands and content of the course far exceed those of a typical A.P. U.S. history course.'' Ms. Goldman says the class was so difficult that she shied away from history when she got to college. ''I was so scared off because of high school that I thought, 'Oh, my God, I'm at Yale. I can't take history.' '' There was no reason to worry, though.  What's happened to high school?  THERE are currently two national conversations about high school.  In September, the Commission on the Future of Higher Education released a report on how ill-prepared high school graduates are for college, citing statistics like this one: 40 percent of college students take remedial courses. Of 1.2 million seniors in the class of 2006 who took the ACT, only 27 percent reached its college-readiness benchmarks in biology, 42 percent in algebra, 53 percent in social science and 69 percent in English composition. The United States secretary of education, Margaret Spellings, has called for accountability testing in high schools.  At the other end of the academic spectrum, however, are the stellar students who are doing ever more difficult work at ever younger ages.  Most college-educated parents share the suspicion that if they applied today, they would not get into their alma maters. It's not so much that they've forgotten basic trigonometry -- which is cosine? -- as that they likely don't measure up to today's students. Academic accomplishment has become a hallmark of upper-middle-class family culture. (As Regina Goldman's mother says: ''What do you expect for $31,000?'')  ''I've been a critic of the low end of our preparation,'' observes Michael Kirst, professor at Stanford's School of Education, who has written about the disconnect between high school and college. ''But at the high end, it just gets better and better every decade.''  Robert Zemsky, professor and chairman of the Learning Alliance at the University of Pennsylvania School of Education, sees academically driven youth -- he labels them zoomers -- as bookish versions of athletically driven children who train seriously for a sport from an early age. ''It's the same thing: You have to focus, you have to specialize, you have to excel,'' he says. ''Those kids are told that, one way or the other, over and over again.''  The debate about how much children can and should do is not new, but several recent books are renewing concerns. In ''The Price of Privilege,'' Madeline Levine, a clinical psychologist in California, describes an ''epidemic among privileged youth'' who are successful academically and socially but inwardly anxious, angry and disconnected. Alexandra Robbins's book, ''The Overachievers: The Secret Lives of Driven Kids,'' chronicles the pressures that drive highly competitive high school students in Bethesda, Md.  Philip Burns, a 2005 graduate of Harvard-Westlake School in North Hollywood, Calif., and a Brown sophomore, says of his high school experience, ''I would be more apt to compare it to working life.'' The culture of high expectations helped keep him focused, he concedes, ''but that view of what teenage life is like, where you have a lot of time to hang around, not do anything, go out to pizza parlors, go to football games, whatever, we didn't have that. We were too busy.'' Now, he says, ''I'm glad I learned what I learned, but they could have throttled it down a little.''  It doesn't take a genius -- or a precocious high school student -- to understand that ramped-up achievement is tightly connected to ramped-up competition for slots at prestigious colleges. At top high schools, tension about college admissions permeates the atmosphere, and students push themselves to the limit.  But with so much college coursework before college, educators say, the academic progression is out of whack. ''We are pushing kids to do so many things to get in, so what do you do when you get in?'' asks Terrel Rhodes, vice president for quality, curriculum and assessment for the Association of American Colleges and Universities, in Washington, D.C. ''If high schools are teaching more and more of what we have been doing the first year in college, what is it college needs to do?''  As they stretch to accommodate students at both ends of the preparation spectrum, universities are grappling with that question: How do you challenge and engage undergraduates?  One answer is to focus less on the acquisition of knowledge and more on how it can be furthered. Undergraduates are being offered more research opportunities and interdisciplinary programs, which require them to apply related concepts in different fields. Other efforts connect extracurricular and community service to coursework so students can road-test what they have learned.  A HIGH SCHOOL'S status is tied to its rigor. The tougher, the better. ''Nobody wants to be the first one to break the cycle,'' says Rita Goldman, upper school principal and college adviser at Germantown Friends School, a private Quaker school in Philadelphia.  Advanced Placement is no longer the zenith of academic challenge. Now there are ''post-A.P.'' courses, for which a good grade in the A.P. course is the prerequisite. Other schools have scrapped A.P. entirely, arguing that the curriculum is too restrictive; they are creating homegrown courses that are more like college work in tone and depth but may still cover A.P. material so students are positioned for the exam.  At Thomas Jefferson, students choose among 14 post-A.P. courses, including a new class on bionanotechnology that studies the relationship between small biological systems and technology. Most telling is that several advanced math courses -- for example, ''Complex Analysis,'' which blends abstract math with practical applications in physics, electrical engineering and fluid modeling -- are taught by Robert Sachs, a math professor and former department chairman at George Mason University. Dr. Sachs uses the same text for some high school and college classes, and says ''Complex Analysis'' covers the same material a college junior or senior would take.  ''If you ask me, 'Is it like the honors curriculum at M.I.T.?' we're probably real close,'' says Dr. Sachs, who notes that he had the most students ever, 35, enrolled this past semester. The number is particularly impressive because students gain entry to the course by completing a full year of advanced math after A.P. calculus. ''The courses I teach are actually a second year beyond A.P.,'' he says.  Such high-level offerings, says Nina Pitkin, director of student services at Thomas Jefferson, reflect the fact that a lot more students arrive having completed algebra II and geometry in middle school, though these courses are typically taken in 9th and 10th grades. Some students actually enter ninth grade having taken the A.P. exam in calculus.  Of course, there have always been smart kids. But whether out of fear, cultural conditioning or some inherent spark, more adolescents than ever before are emerging from the pack and distinguishing themselves academically. Super-achievers aren't just bright; they crave that distinction.  A high-level math class at Andover ''is no longer a group of geeks,'' a teacher says. Such classes may include students whose focus is history and international relations.  ''I have pushed myself as hard as I can here,'' Prateek Kumar, an Andover senior from Albany, N.Y., says between classes on Civil War literature and international relations. ''There have been those nights I am completely stressed because I have two papers due, in English and history, and I have a math test.'' But, he adds, ''I have enjoyed it.'' Mr. Kumar, a top scorer in national math competitions who has discovered a love for history and become editor of the school paper, lives by the credo that school is what you make of it.  Such thinking is one reason Peter Watt's Physics 580 is a popular course at Andover. The appeal? It's the accelerated version of A.P. physics that completes the curriculum in two trimesters instead of three. Take a seat in his classroom and it is at once obvious how this happens: Dr. Watt speeds through linear motion equations for projectiles with no resistance, filling multiple blackboards with chalked Greek letters while attracting nary a quizzical look from any of the 18 students seated at the lab table facing him.  When he begins a problem involving shooting water from a garden hose at some angle to land on a wall, a student suggests a complication: ''What if you have a fire hose?''  ''You can't just throw out Newton because you have a fire hose!'' retorts Dr. Watt, who throws up more calculus to explore variations of the hose's spray, including an equation that would foolishly send water directly overhead.  Dr. Watt's course is fast, fun and all theoretical. He boasts while scanning several blackboards worth of equations that ''there's not a number in sight.''  ''Physicists are lazy,'' he quips. ''Do you know how much energy it takes to put numbers into a calculator?''  Dr. Watt's students are anything but lazy. He has had to turn students away from this course -- last year, only students earning a 5 or a 6 on a 1-to-6 grade scale in Physics 380 could enroll; this year, only those with a 6 got in. He also turns away applicants for his ''post-A.P.'' course on quantum mechanics and relativity, limited to 16. What's more, students take the quantum mechanics in spring of their senior year, when it's too late to impress admissions officers. ''They don't need to burnish their transcripts,'' says Dr. Watt, a Harvard Ph.D. in physics who says the course is what a physics major would take sophomore or junior year. ''They are just voracious.''  At Andover, enrollments are up significantly over the past five years in all of the most advanced courses.  This shift is apparent to William H. Pahlka, director of studies at Riverdale Country School, who was teaching 29 years ago when the school instituted its signature course, ''Integrated Liberal Studies.'' The class, required for all seniors, stretches the definition of survey course, spanning ancient Greece to the early 20th century. Students rotate daily among five teachers covering philosophy, literature and the history of science, music and art. Readings come from a who's who in civilization.  While students grumble loudly about how difficult the course is -- something Dr. Pahlka dismisses as ''braggadocio'' -- he is struck by how much harder they work than students of a decade ago, even though he believes they are brighter and could get away with working less. Today's students ''fear not being at the top,'' he says, and are hyper-prepared for class, raising the quality of discussions and coursework.  ''I am amazed at the drive of students in the independent school world in New York right now,'' he says. ''A lot of kids were able to get through our course years ago by doing very little, faking knowledge.'' Students now, he says, ''are saturated with the details we give them.''  DAVID OXTOBY, president of Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., is troubled by the trend. He believes that professors can no longer count on high schools to make sure students have fundamentals down cold. ''High schools are trying to imitate college and teach college-type material instead of the high school material they used to teach,'' he says. ''They are now learning the advanced stuff, but not the basic stuff.'' He continues: ''We are finding students who have learned about s-, p- and d-orbitals -- a theoretical concept in chemistry -- but they don't know that chlorine is a gas.''  Some colleges have been pushing back against A.P.'s, which students rack up hoping to waive entry-level courses. At Stanford, departments are less willing to let students with top A.P. scores (4 or 5) skip courses. As of this fall, says Laura Selznick, a freshman adviser there for 28 years, ''a 5 on A.P. Econ is no longer an express ticket into the economics department.'' Partly this reflects doubt that A.P. classes actually cover college-level material. But also, ''part of it is that students think they know it, but they don't know it all,'' Ms. Selznick says. She insists college academics are different from high school, even if the texts are the same.  Dr. Rhodes, of the Association of American Colleges and Universities, concurs. High school-age students are not mature enough to grasp the subtleties of some material, he says.  Many colleges frown on letting students skip entry-level courses, even with placement tests, he says. ''Some say, 'You start out at the beginning, even if there is repetition; we want you to get what we're offering the way we're offering it and have our education,' '' he says. In any case, placement tests are ''an imperfect system'' for matching students with course content, he says. Facts and vocabulary may escape students taking the tests; but in class, the material ''all starts coming back,'' he says. ''Very quickly, they get bored, or they see it as a waste of time'' -- although, Dr. Rhodes adds, sometimes students are so burned-out after high school they don't mind repeating material. They can decompress while getting an easy A.  Katherine Bergeron, dean of the college at Brown, believes the bigger issue is not about sequencing academic content, but getting students to view college as a time for reflection and exploration. It is part of the liberal arts ideal that pre-med students delve into Proust, but college leaders say many top students want to pursue serious challenges in their fields of interest earlier in their college careers. ''The message they get from the admissions process already speaks against that liberal arts ideal,'' says Dr. Bergeron, sitting in her University Hall office overlooking the grassy, tree-lined College Green. She says too many super-achievers have what she calls a ''kind of professionalized attitude toward their education'' as they rush to get to where they're headed next.  ''I just sent a letter to the seniors; they got it in their boxes yesterday,'' she says. Her message: Try something different, unexpected. ''Think,'' it urges, ''about the present tense.'' Dr. Bergeron, who assumed her post in July, says her goal is to expand the advising program in the upper classes ''to make it more reflective for students all the way through, make them aware of all the options available.''  As part of a revamping of its undergraduate experience, Stanford has also been working toward more thoughtful guidance. Previously, guiding freshmen was a volunteer job filled mostly by university staff and graduate students; now faculty members are recruited and offered an honorarium. This year, Stanford changed the way students were matched with academic advisers to more pointedly reflect common interests. ''If you come in being a super-duper physicist, you get matched with a physicist,'' Ms. Selznick says. ''If you are a first-generation college student, you are matched with someone who is good at working with first-generation college students.''  To engage underclassmen academically, they are being offered expanded seminar-style classes, independent study and opportunities to do research with faculty members. In the past six years, the number of Stanford undergraduates doing research has risen from 300 to 2,000 a year, according to Dr. Bravman, the vice provost.  Other universities, and even liberal arts colleges like Davidson and Swarthmore, have likewise increased undergraduate research opportunities. In labs once the province of graduate students and teachers, undergraduates may find themselves injecting fish eggs with transgenic plasmids to test the technique of marking cells, or analyzing drill samples from the San Andreas fault.  Russell Fernald, who teaches two 300-student lecture courses in biology at Stanford, says working in labs pushes undergraduates to think about what they know in new ways. ''In the classroom, we don't teach them about the unknown, we teach them about the known,'' he says. ''In the classroom, I could imagine students being bored.'' In the lab, he says, students wrangle with the nature of discovery: ''How do you decide what is worth asking?''  He also sees value in the collaborative nature of laboratory work. ''They need to learn to be a team, and research is all about that,'' he says. ''They have to identify with the problem, not their particular goals.''  Some high schools, of course, already offer a chance to do research; at Thomas Jefferson, it's required for graduation.  WHEN Carly Rush, the Brown junior, arrived on campus, she figured she would just keep doing what had made her successful at T.J. She knew, she says, ''how to prioritize your work, how to take a massive quantity of things and handle it.'' Hunkered down in high school high-gear mode, she took her first economics test. She bombed. She scored in the 80s. She called home in tears over her poor beginning. Then the teacher applied a curve, a foreign concept at Thomas Jefferson, where you get what you get. Relative to her econ classmates, it turned out, she was at the top of the class.  Well-prepared high school graduates arrive on campus with valuable study skills. They know when to do the reading and when to just take notes at the lecture. They can zip off well-conceived papers while classmates who are unprepared for college writing struggle.  Ms. Rush had an epiphany: Unlike at T.J., she didn't have to kill herself. So she has followed Dr. Bergeron's playbook of exploration. Instead of cramming, she spends more time on her interests, like politics. ''I wasn't scared to go to the college Democrats meeting because I was confident I could handle my classes,'' she recalls.  Wearing a high school ring with a pink birthstone, she zooms around campus, working with an education professor who is studying children's perceptions of learning and cultural differences, organizing events for the Brown Democrats club, tutoring high school students, advising freshmen and being host of a Wednesday-night dessert social in her dorm room.  Ms. Rush acknowledges the advantages afforded by her high-school preparation, but she is blunt in saying, ''I wouldn't want to do it again.'' She has a 3.9 G.P.A., and when ''shopping period'' rolls around at the start of each semester (students visit classes before deciding which to enroll in), Ms. Rush shops extra hard to make sure she hasn't already had the material. ''The first two days you are taking 10 classes a day,'' she says. ''If you've done Locke before,'' you want to steer clear of a course heavy on 17th-century political philosophy.  ''College has been less stressful academically,'' she says, ''but I have poured just as much of myself into it.''  Laura Pappano is author, with Eileen McDonagh, of ''Playing With the Boys: Separate Is Not Equal in Sports,'' to be published in October by Oxford.  Correction:  January 14, 2007, Sunday  An article in the special Education Life section last Sunday about the large percentage of Asian students at the University of California, Berkeley, attributed an erroneous distinction to the state. Hawaii -- not California -- was the first state without a racial majority.  Also, an article about financial aid for graduate students misstated eligibility for federal PLUS loans. Graduate students may indeed apply for the loans; they became eligible in July 2006.  And an article about rigorous high schools misstated the student newspaper job held by Prateek Kumar of Phillips Academy, who talked about his challenging courses. Mr. Kumar is deputy managing editor of the Phillipian, not the top editor. (Stephen S. Blackman is the editor in chief.)  ",

            "text": "  A school is a fragile thing. That's particularly so if it is small, homegrown and designed by an educator with an idiosyncratic vision.  Crossroads Middle School was started 16 years ago by Ann Wiener, who squeezed 200 students into the fifth-floor attic of an old Renaissance castle of an elementary school on West 109th Street. The school was an effort to fashion an unorthodox public alternative to the Upper West Side's chaotic junior high schools, and it tried unconventional approaches like mixing sixth, seventh and eighth graders in the same classes and having children defend report cards at parent-teacher conferences. Textbooks were given less emphasis than syllabuses devised by teachers, and in-depth projects were favored over surveys, and the building of a sarcophagus rather than an overview of Egyptian history.  Reading and math scores were below the citywide average, but many of the school's students were from poor homes and a larger than average number had learning disabilities. The school also did not spend weeks on test preparation as so many schools now do. Still, graduates went on to strong high schools like Beacon, Mott Hall and the Museum School.  Dionne Gadsden, a parent of a Crossroads eighth grader, said Ms. Wiener made students who might have been rejected by more highly ranked schools ''feel good about themselves and be successful -- they were not throwaway kids.''  While so-called progressive schools are not to everyone's taste, Crossroads worked for its particular mix of children. Then, in August 2005, Ms. Wiener retired. And ever since, the school has been in what many parents and former teachers consider a meltdown.  Eleven of the 12 teachers have quit, some from retirements and career switches, others out of dissatisfaction with changes in the school. Crossroads is on its third principal, the quirky programs that defined the school have been lopped off, and at least half a dozen parents pulled their children out before graduation.  ''There's nothing left of the history of what Crossroads was,'' said Ellen Rafel, a guidance counselor until September.  Jonathan Torres left in October in the middle of seventh grade, because, he said, ''many kids were throwing spitballs and chairs.'' He continued: ''I learned nothing there. All the kids were talking, and they got away with it.'' His mother, Luz Laureano, said that the school no longer told her when her son failed to do homework and that it was not stopping other students from teasing him. ''The sense of family'' she had always felt when she visited the school was lost, she said.  What has happened at Crossroads offers a cautionary tale about unconventional schools, and how their success often depends on new leaders sharing the founders' philosophy and the support of higher-ups. If those buttresses are not there, the delicate framework can crumble.  Seymour Fliegel, president of the Center for Educational Innovation-Public Education Association, who has started scores of small schools, said progressive schools work only when everybody is ''marching to the same drummer.'' That is why Garth Harries, chief executive of the city Department of Education's Office of New Schools, who coordinates the 184 schools opened as the Bloomberg's administration's signature reform, advises existing schools to make sure they cultivate future leaders in accord with their founders' ideas. Small schools, he said, ''are smaller places where the ripple effect of a mistake can more quickly damage the environment.''  The current principal of Crossroads, Rodney Murphy, did not let this writer visit the school. According to David Cantor, a spokesman for the Education Department, Mr. Murphy said he was ''trying to get stability'' back.  Ms. Wiener, now 73, is a fiercely dedicated educator who daily climbed five flights of stairs to work 12-hour days. She assembled a team of like-minded teachers who also put in extra hours. She admitted students on interviews and portfolios of work, not on the basis of test scores, and assigned each child an adviser who was required to meet with groups of students twice a week.  ''There was a magic about Ann -- she got us to buy into things,'' said Patricia Sebastian, a Crossroads humanities teacher who left in September because, she said, the school's identity was being whittled away.  AT least one teacher said Ms. Wiener ran too loose a ship, with students escaping penalties if they talked disrespectfully or roamed halls. ''They were well intentioned, but to me there was limited structure,'' said Akisa Omulepu, who trained teachers as a math coach. Still, it was a telling measure that in a neighborhood where many middle-class white parents send children to private schools, Crossroads, where most students are black and Hispanic, annually drew some white students as well.  Ms. Wiener, who now coaches principals as an education department consultant, said in an interview that she retired because ''it's hard running a school, and I felt I didn't have the energy.'' But, she added, referring to officials in Region 10, which embraces the West Side, Harlem and Washington Heights, ''It's clear that those who were in charge decided they wanted the school to go in a different direction.''  It's ''fair to say,'' she added, that a renewed emphasis on testing as a result of the federal No Child Left Behind law also created pressure to change the character of the school.  Former teachers at the school said a Region 10 instructional superintendent, Roser Salavert, disapproved of ending classes at midday Friday for three-hour staff meetings, and did not like students spending class time on adviser meetings. ''They didn't quite get us,'' Ms. Rafel said.  Ms. Salavert said she was following chancellor's regulations.  Some parents and staff members contend that after Ms. Wiener, the first new principal, Joseph F. Rand, nibbled away at some of her approaches by substituting the Region 10 curriculum for Crossroads teacher-designed curricula. Mr. Rand said he was following the region's demands.  When students took the English-language arts test a year ago, only 27.6 percent reached proficiency level, a drop from 31.9 percent in 2005, Ms. Wiener's last year. Mr. Rand pointed out that scores in math increased to 46 percent proficient, from 35.8 percent.  But to parents and teachers, in a school like Crossroads, tests, with their four-level proficiency scale, never captured its quality or the affection parents and children had for it. ''You can't ask me to take the 1s and 2s that nobody wants to teach and then penalize me when everybody is not at Level 4,'' Ms. Sebastian said.  The talents needed to lead an offbeat school are not as transferable as those required to lead a conventional one; Mr. Rand's superiors could have done far more to make sure he grasped Crossroads' philosophy. Ms. Salavert said she did that, but Mr. Rand himself said the transition was not well handled.  ''Without an understanding of the school, things fall apart,'' he said. ''I had no idea what Crossroads stood for. I had never gone to Crossroads prior to Aug. 31 and had little time to talk to the outgoing principal.''  Then Mr. Rand left, too, to become director of seven Bronx schools for suspended students. The region appointed Mr. Murphy, who had spent the previous year leading a small West Side school that closed. Crossroads still had two Wiener-era teachers left, but, teachers said, Mr. Murphy reprimanded one, Naima Beckles, for not posting his monthly proverbs and for othersuch lapses, and she left. Jamilah Clark, a mother of an eighth grader, said classrooms were now more crowded and unruly.  ''Kids are scared, angry and confused,'' she said. ''I'm an adult, and I'm confused about what's going on in the building.''  ON EDUCATION E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com  ",

            "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''Trying to Find Solutions in Chaotic Middle Schools'' (''The Critical Years'' series, front page, Jan. 3):  It's a shame that the situation in the schools in your article rings so true.  The ages between 10 and 13 are an odd time because this is when children start to change, and some start to feel extremely uncomfortable with themselves. Segregating them into middle schools can reinforce that.  The nice thing about K-through-8 schools is that the children in the middle grades have an opportunity to mentor the younger children.  Separating out the fifth through eighth graders and then sending them on to high school means that they go through an adjustment of being the youngest three times instead of twice.  It can be beneficial for younger children to interact with the older ones if there are clear expectations on both sides.  I was fortunate when I was in high school to be allowed to tutor some younger students. What I learned from that has affected my work today in that I know that people don't learn at the same speed or in the same way.  I did not get that in middle school because we were segregated from the younger students and the older students as well.  In addition, it's nice to see where one has been (first grade) and where one is headed (eighth grade) while one is in sixth grade.  Older students can learn so much from interacting in a supervised situation with young students. It can give them a wonderful feeling of community that is not present in many places today.  A. L. Alterman  Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.  Jan. 3, 2007  To the Editor:  Your article articulates some of the challenges of early adolescence that the middle school movement, at its inception, sought to address.  Early adolescence is a stage of development when bodies and minds are changing more rapidly than at any other time in life, when emotions are unstable and relationships with peers become the driving force in life.  The article described a school system that is sadly missing the educational mark for early adolescents.  At this stage of life, children need safe schools in which they are actively engaged in challenging learning experiences that build their understandings of themselves and their world. An effective middle school curriculum must build on the interests of this age group to capture their attention.  These are the heart of the middle school, which no change in grade configuration can replace. The developmental needs of young people must be taken seriously if we are to create successful middle schools.  It is painful to read of consistent failure when there is so much that middle schools could be doing. Successful approaches are being used across the country. We need to be using more of these in New York.  Sue Ruskin-Mayher  New York, Jan. 3, 2007  The writer is director of middle school general teacher education at the Bank Street College of Education.  To the Editor:  You do an excellent job highlighting the difficulties encountered by middle schools. One thing you do not mention, however, is the frequently used policy of social promotion.  All too often, students learn that they will be passed on to the next grade regardless of whether or not they pass their classes.  As a result, many middle schools do not instill a sense of academic accountability in their students.  The end result is a large number of ill-prepared high school freshmen and increased numbers of dropouts as these students fail to earn credit toward graduation.  If school administrators are serious about reforming our middle schools, an alternative to social promotion, other than retention, needs to be developed.  Adam Berlin  Lawrence, N.Y., Jan. 3, 2007  The writer is a social studies teacher at Lawrence Middle School.  To the Editor:  Hmmm, they seem restless and undisciplined. Why not direct that excess energy toward learning or training at some point during the school day? What about dance, theater, singing, knitting or kickball? To the point that they're worn out.  And maybe even feel good about having learned something they can see and feel. And even appreciate classes where they just sit for a while.  Mary Garber  Richmond, Va., Jan. 3, 2007  ",

You also claim that ''many charter schools do a superb job.'' Where is the evidence?  In most of Connecticut's charter schools, the percentage of students meeting targets on the Connecticut Mastery Test and Connecticut Academic Performance Test is below the state average -- sometimes well below. This evidence is consistent with the conclusions of studies conducted across this country -- that students in charter schools do no better than those in traditional public schools, on state tests and on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The one, admittedly limited, study finding promise in Connecticut's charter schools attributes a large part of this success precisely to the state's strict limits on expansion that you decry.  Where charter schools succeed in Connecticut, there is no evidence that ''educational innovation'' is at play, as you claim, rather than longer school hours, smaller schools and smaller class sizes than those in traditional public schools. These conditions have been long known to educators and parents to raise student achievement. They should be made available to all of our public school children, not just the select few who attend charter schools.

            "text": "  With Michigan's new ban on affirmative action going into effect, and similar ballot initiatives looming in other states, many public universities are scrambling to find race-blind ways to attract more blacks and Hispanics.  At Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, a new admissions policy, without mentioning race, allows officials to consider factors like living on an Indian reservation or in mostly black Detroit, or overcoming discrimination or prejudice.  Others are using many different approaches, like working with mostly minority high schools, using minority students as recruiters, and offering summer prep programs for promising students from struggling high schools. Ohio State University, for example, has started a magnet high school with a focus on math and science, to help prepare potential applicants, and sends educators into poor and low-performing middle and elementary schools to encourage children, and their parents, to start planning for college.  Officials across the country have a sense of urgency about the issue in part because Ward Connerly, the black California businessman behind such initiatives in California and Michigan, is planning a kind of Super Tuesday next fall, with ballot initiatives against racial preferences in several states. He is researching possible campaigns in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, and expects to announce next month which states he has chosen.  Ann Korschgen, vice provost at the University of Missouri, said in a recent interview, ''Just this morning, we had a conversation along the line of how we would continue to ensure diversity at our campus if we could not consider race.''  The issue is already heating up in Colorado. This month, two Republican representatives in Colorado asked the state to examine the University of Colorado's spending on diversity, after a libertarian group questioned the expenditures.  Mr. Connerly said that a decade ago, when California passed its ban, Proposition 209, he thought the state was ahead of its time, but that now, he believes ''the country is poised to make a decision about race, about what its place in American life is going to be -- and I really believe the popular vote may be the way to achieve that.''  Both defenders and opponents of affirmative action say the lesson of last fall's campaign in Michigan -- where Proposition 2, banning race and gender preferences in public education, employment and contracting, passed by 58 percent to 42 percent despite strong opposition from government, business, labor, education and religious leaders -- is that such initiatives can succeed almost anywhere.  ''Certain things become popular as state initiatives, like the ban on gay marriages, and restrictions on affirmative action could become one of those things,'' said Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education.  If so, he said, private universities, with their wide discretion in admissions and financial aid, could have a competitive advantage regarding diversity, reshaping the landscape of higher education.  ''Private universities can do whatever they want, consistent with federal law and the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Hartle said. ''Where minority students have a choice between selective public universities that cannot use affirmative action, and selective private universities with strong affirmative action programs, the private universities may seem like the more hospitable places, which would give them an advantage in drawing a diverse student body.''  To many educators, that would be a troubling turnabout.  ''You'd think public universities are charged with special responsibility for ensuring access, but it could come to be exactly the opposite, if there are a lot of these state initiatives,'' said Evan Caminker, the dean of the University of Michigan Law School, adding, ''in terms of public values, it's a big step backward.''  Mr. Connerly is unbothered: If black and Hispanic students are rare at selective universities, the solution is better academic preparation, not special treatment in admissions. ''Every individual should have the same opportunity to compete,'' he said. ''I don't worry about the outcomes.''  Legally, affirmative action has been a moving target. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in cases involving the University of Michigan that race could be one of many factors in admissions, although admissions offices could not give extra points to minority candidates. Many colleges nationwide then moved to ''holistic'' review, considering applicants' ethnicity, but not awarding a set number of points. In states that could face a ballot initiative campaign, though, that standard could fall.  Nationwide, after 30 years of debate, and litigation, over affirmative action, universities have made strikingly little progress toward racially representative student bodies. And recently, with growing awareness that affluent students are vastly overrepresented at selective colleges, the longstanding focus on racial diversity has been joined by a growing concern about economic diversity.  Currently, four states with highly ranked public universities -- California, Florida, Michigan and Washington -- forbid racial preferences, either because of ballot propositions or decisions by elected officials.  Texas banned affirmative action for seven years. The University of Texas resumed consideration of race after the 2003 United States Supreme Court ruling. ''We need every tool we can get,'' concluded Dr. Bruce Walker, the university's director of admissions.  In California and Texas, the first two states to ban racial preferences, underrepresented minorities at the flagship universities declined -- even though both states, and Florida, adopted plans giving a percentage of top high school graduates guaranteed admission to state universities.  In Texas, students admitted through the Top 10 percent plan swamped the flagship Austin campus. But the plan, now being rethought by the Legislature, never brought in many minority students. Last fall, with both race-conscious admissions and the Top 10 plan, blacks made up an all-time high of 5 percent of the freshman class, and Hispanics 19 percent.  A decade after the California ban, only 2 percent of this year's freshmen at the University of California, Los Angeles, are black: a 30-year low. Hispanic representation at U.C.L.A. has dropped, too. At Berkeley, the number of blacks in the freshman class plunged by half the year after the ban, and the number of Hispanics nearly as much.  Systemwide, blacks make up only 3 percent of U.C. freshmen, although about 7 percent of the state's high school graduates are black. Most top black students choose private institutions over state campuses. Over all, of the top third of all students offered admission to the University of California class of 2005, most enrolled and only 19 percent went instead to selective private colleges. But among blacks in that group, 51 percent chose selective private colleges. Meanwhile, up the coast, Stanford University is enrolling more underrepresented minority students. Among this year's freshmen, 11 percent are African-American, up from 8 percent in 1995; Hispanic enrollment has risen, too.  ''Folks look for a place that's comfortable,'' said Richard Shaw, Stanford's admissions dean. ''They want a sense that there's kids like them at the institution.''  The University of Michigan, with other state institutions, tried to win a delay of the ban so it would not hit in the middle of this year's admissions cycle.But the courts rejected this effort, so officials have stopped considering race and gender as factors in admissions, and worry that next year's entering class will be less diverse. Many officials worry that they will lose top minority candidates to selective private universities.  ''We know from colleagues in Texas and California that if we can't take race into account, we're at a competitive disadvantage,'' said Julie Peterson, a spokeswoman for the University of Michigan, where two-thirds of the applicants are from out of state.  Since most of Michigan is overwhelmingly white, said Mary Sue Coleman, the university's president, a plan guaranteeing admission to a percentage of top high school graduates would have little impact, and nothing short of affirmative action will maintain the university's racial diversity.  ''Of course, you want to look at family income, and being the first in the family to attend college and those kinds of factors, of course we do that, but it doesn't get us to a racially diverse student body,'' Dr. Coleman said.  At the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, a program guaranteeing that low-income students can graduate debt-free helped to increase the percentage of blacks in the freshman class to 12 percent, and to increase both economic diversity and the enrollment of underrepresented minority students. Other states have started similar programs.  In Detroit, Wayne State University Law School recently adopted a new admissions policy. Jonathan Weinberg, the professor assigned last year to draft a contingency policy, looked at other states with race-blind admissions and found that instead of race, they look to ''a set of broader diversity concerns that go to socioeconomic status.''  Last month, the faculty adopted his policy, eliminating any mention of race, but broadening the factors the admissions office may consider. Those include being the first in the family to go to college or graduate school; having overcome substantial obstacles, including prejudice and discrimination; being multilingual; and residence abroad, in Detroit or on an Indian reservation.  Frank Wu, the law school's dean, said Wayne State's effort to comply with the law could bring a legal challenge.  ''There's a new fight building,'' Mr. Wu said, ''and that's going to be whether the mere fact that you're striving for diversity means you're somehow trying to get around the ban and find proxies, or pretexts, for race, and that that's impermissible. It's ironic, but in some quarters our effort to adopt a new policy to comply with Prop 2 has been interpreted as an effort to circumvent it.''  Roger Clegg, president of the Council for Equal Opportunity, which opposes racial preferences, said policies like Wayne State's do raise questions.  ''I have a real problem when schools adopt what on their face are race-neutral criteria, if they are doing so to reach a predetermined racial and ethnic goal,'' Mr. Clegg said. ''Both in law and in common sense, the motivation matters.''  At Ohio State University, where admissions are increasingly selective, officials are looking for a long-term answer. ''When we saw what was coming down the road, we started looking to other models, but no other model results in as much diversity,'' said Mabel Freeman, assistant vice president at Ohio State. ''The only long-term solution is to do better in the pipeline and make sure all kids get the best education possible, K-12.''  Correction:  January 31, 2007, Wednesday  A front-page article on Friday about efforts by public colleges to attract minority students misstated the name of the organization headed by Roger Clegg that opposes racial preferences. It is the Center for Equal Opportunity, not the Council for Equal Opportunity.  ",

            "text": "  Twenty three schools in Westchester failed to meet requirements outlined by the federal No Child Left Behind law, including four schools that were newly identified as in need of improvement, the State Education Department announced last week.  They are Ossining High School, Greenburgh Eleven High School in Dobbs Ferry, Sleepy Hollow Middle School in Tarrytown and School 23 in Yonkers.  Schools are designated in need of improvement when students do not show enough progress on statewide tests in English and mathematics. For the first time this year, schools were judged on the scores of students in the third, fifth, sixth and seventh grades, in addition to fourth, eighth and 11th graders. Not only must schools show improvement over all, but they must also meet achievement targets for component groups, like racial categories and special education.  Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act, schools that receive federal money must replace administrators or close schools if they do not improve after several years. Roosevelt High School and Emerson Middle School in Yonkers have already reorganized, and two other Yonkers middle schools, Commerce and Museum, are planning to do so this year.  ''We made the decision to redesign Roosevelt so it became two schools, with designated administrative staff for each,'' said Jerilynne Fierstein, spokeswoman for the district. ''The idea is to personalize the instruction and stay more focused on the curriculum.''  The state also removed three schools from the list because of improvements in scores, including two high schools in Yonkers, Lincoln and Gorton, that reversed several consecutive years of failure. ''We are thrilled,'' Ms. Fierstein said. ''It was quite an accomplishment for the staffs of those schools.''  Schools that do not receive federal money are not subject to No Child Left Behind sanctions, but are required to meet state demands for improvement if their students do not meet targets. Twelve of the 23 failing schools are on that list, which is referred to as ''schools requiring academic progress.''  THE WEEK  ",

            "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''Taking the Middle Schoolers Out of the Middle'' (''The Critical Years'' series, front page, Jan. 22):  Yes, students of middle school age are hard to place. But before we dismantle middle schools, let's first see if we even gave them a chance.  Middle schools were designed to provide a place between the self-contained classroom of elementary school and the fragmented world of high school.  A middle school is built around teams, where the same teachers teach the same students, with opportunities to meet during the day to collaborate about curriculum and student progress, providing effective communication with parents, counselors and administration.  I have taught in such a program in both New York and here in California. But such programs are holding on by a thread. It takes district-led vision and commitment to design and support these programs.  A well-structured middle school can make a real difference in these crucial transitional years.  Steve Carson  San Francisco, Jan. 22, 2007  To the Editor:  The middle grades are not about what grade levels occupy a building, but what happens in any building to meet the learning needs of children ages 10 to 15.  I appreciate that you've highlighted the current restructuring trends. But to really gauge what is happening in the two schools, K-8 or 6-12, we must look critically at student achievement and adjustment levels and what program elements contribute to student success.  In New York City, as elsewhere, we need academically rigorous, developmentally appropriate and socially equitable schools for students ages 10 to 15. We need to stop thinking of grade restructuring as a silver bullet and start addressing what's going on inside.  In order to provide adolescents with the tools they need to succeed, policy makers must work with educators to use research-based practices to transform what's happening inside our nation's middle grades and not be satisfied with superficial fixes.  Deborah Kasak  Exec. Dir., National Forum to  Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform  Champaign, Ill., Jan. 23, 2007  To the Editor:  Your Jan. 22 article about middle schools reports that some middle school experts see ''smaller classes, an engaging curriculum, personalized attention and well-prepared teachers'' as effective responses to the challenge of teaching young adolescents.  This is correct.  We need to address the developmental needs of young adolescents, regardless of whether they are in a K-8, 5-9 or 6-12 configuration. This is what the middle school movement advocates.  Ross  M. Burkhardt  Las Cruces, N.M., Jan. 22, 2007  The writer is a past president of the National Middle School Association.  To the Editor:  Closing middle schools and moving the students into K-8 schools may or may not improve outcomes for former middle schoolers, but such a shift is not likely to benefit the youngest children in the building.  In research for my recent book, I visited schools in more than a dozen states and concluded that young children are best served in schools that concentrate on constructing a learning foundation for them from pre-kindergarten through third grade.  The focus -- without the distraction of catering to older students -- should be on providing them with the academic skills, understanding, habits and dispositions that will serve them throughout their education.  This kind of grounding is not apt to occur in today's K-8 school, which inevitably gives greatest attention to the test scores of older students and preparing them for high school.  If K-8 schools grow more prevalent, then they should create a school within a school for the youngest children with their own assistant principal, a separate support staff and separate professional development for teachers. They should also have their own wing of the building, an area where everybody is ''primary minded,'' as a second grade teacher in Glen Ridge, N.J., put it to me.  Gene I. Maeroff  Edison, N.J., Jan. 22, 2007  The writer is a senior fellow at Teachers College, Columbia University.  To the Editor:  As the parent of two seventh graders in middle school and one ninth grader in her first year of high school, I read the Jan. 22 article about middle schools with interest.  Nowhere was the issue of drugs and alcohol mentioned. The article notes that some educators argue that ''11-, 12- and 13-year-olds thrive in the presence of older role models and reminders of concrete goals, like playing varsity sports and getting into college.''  But these older students can also provide easy access to drugs and alcohol -- access that most probably would not be found if students remained longer in middle schools.  Felice Kobrick  East Hills, N.Y., Jan. 22, 2007  To the Editor:  As parents of three sons -- 11, 14 and 16 years old -- who have changed schools twice in recent years, my wife and I have a few insights into the middle school debate.  For one, middle school presents a host of challenges regardless of the model, and the best way to meet them is by communicating regularly with your child's teachers and, most vital, with your child.  Our sons are happily enrolled at Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, and its success in nudging its middle school students toward adulthood while nurturing them with the care appropriate to their age (why should the two goals contradict each other?) is indeed laudable.  But that success is hardly the simple outcome of a particular model. It is the result of a tireless principal with high expectations, and a dedicated teaching staff determined to meet them.

Morley's improbable jump in grade point average put him at the center of a scandal at University High School, a correspondence school in Miami that was found to be a diploma mill.  Morley, a sophomore starting safety, played in Tennessee's 20-10 loss to Penn State in the Outback Bowl on Jan. 1, but the university said in a news release Friday that he was no longer enrolled.  Morley was dismissed for not meeting the university's academic requirements.  ''We have university standards that have to be met, or there will be consequences,'' Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said in a statement. ''Our athletes have a tremendous support system at the University of Tennessee. The bottom line is he was not accountable for his own actions when he had every chance to succeed.''  Attempts to reach Fulmer yesterday were unsuccessful.  Morley was considered the top player in talent-rich South Florida when he signed with the Volunteers in 2005. This season, he had 51 tackles and 2 interceptions.  Morley was the most highly regarded football player to graduate from University High School, a diploma mill in Miami that gave fast and easy grades to at least 28 athletes so they could qualify for college scholarships.  Morley was probably headed to a junior college or prep school after he received three F's during his junior year at Killian High School, a public school in Miami. He ended his junior year with a 2.09 grade point average.  But during his senior year, he made a remarkable academic recovery and became embroiled in a scandal that led to University High's closing after an article about the school in The New York Times in November 2005. Morley took a full load of courses during his senior year at Killian while leading the team to a state title. He also took seven courses at University High School, scoring A's and B's in those courses.  Thanks to the seven courses at University High, Morley achieved a 2.75 grade point average, which, combined with his SAT score, met the N.C.A.A.'s minimum standards and allowed him to graduate in December.  Roberta Sussman, an English teacher at Killian High who taught Morley during his senior year at the school, said she was saddened to learn that academic troubles had led to his dismissal at Tennessee.  ''This is a kid who got robbed,'' Sussman said in a telephone interview. ''Literally robbed of a chance for a career. He could have been a professional ballplayer. He had the talent. He didn't feel like he needed the academic background to succeed in college. Shortcuts often lead to dead ends. I'm disappointed for him, because his future is now just like nothing compared to what it could have been.''  Sussman, who described Morley as a smart student who was never pushed to apply himself academically because of his athletic talent, said his woes were heartbreaking.  ''He was lied to; he was misled,'' she said. ''These people who told him he didn't need to worry about the academics set him up for failure.''  Midway through the 2006 season, Morley was benched during the first half of the Vols' game against South Carolina for, Fulmer said, ''not taking academics as seriously as he should, for missing class and not telling me the truth.''  Tennessee had a good perspective of how University High worked. The university sent its associate athletic director for compliance, Brad Bertani, to Miami to visit the school. Bertani took his information to an admission panel that was to decide whether to admit Morley. Three of the four members were leery, telling The Times that the transcript was ''very, very questionable'' and caused ''concerns'' and ''reservations.''  Morley was still admitted, although the panel never voted.  Tennessee's athletic director, Mike Hamilton, did not say whether the university regretted admitting Morley, but he said high schools like University High were ''detrimental'' to college athletics.  He said Morley was afforded many opportunities to excel academically at Tennessee.  ''I don't necessarily think that it was going to be something that was going to come easy to him by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that he certainly had the ability to perform if he made the decisions to do so,'' Hamilton said in a telephone interview, adding that he had met several times with Morley about his academics and had offered him encouragement.  Hamilton said he and Fulmer had not discussed whether Morley would be allowed to return to Tennessee if he could raise his grade-point average.  Linda Bensel-Meyers, a former Tennessee professor who publicized instances of academic misconduct at the university, said Morley's failure was a result of Tennessee's sacrificing academics for athletic success.  ''I don't think there's going to be any change at Tennessee,'' Bensel-Meyers, now an associate professor at the University of Denver, said in a telephone interview. ''The teams that will prosper are those that are able to disguise the ways they bend the academic rules. As long as they want to keep their program, they're probably going to continue.''

Women were deemed unfit for the rigors of higher education -- insufficient blood to the brain, you know -- and in need of teaching more suited to their jobs as mothers and wives. The rest is history. Today, women make up 58 percent of college enrollment. Their numbers started growing in the 1980s, though men still rule at the most elite institutions. The colleges and universities below, single sex at their founding, illustrate the path of coeducation. It's a fuzzy path. A graduate school might have admitted women almost 100 years before the undergraduate program did. More recently, women's colleges have been opening their doors to the opposite sex.  As for that mainstay of the old-boy network, fraternities, they thrive sporadically. Of the institutions below, Washington & Lee University rules, followed by DePauw and Sewanee: University of the South.  DATA  ",

            "text": "  THE debate over how to educate young adolescents is about as stubborn and mercurial as a 13-year-old.  First, educators created junior high schools, believing preteens needed to be treated like adults. But those students weren't ready to be treated as high school students, either. So reformers created the concept of middle schools, which were supposed to be a warm bath to ease the transition. Now, an increasing number of schools across the country, including in Baltimore and Philadelphia, are shifting the middle grades back to elementary school.  But some research suggests that may not be the solution, either. So the age-old issues persist, with some variation from decade to decade: surging hormones make students irritable and sleepy. They struggle to relate to their peers and gain independence from their parents. To hear some parents tell it, one day their babies are innocent elementary schoolers in overalls, the next they're dressing like Paris Hilton and simulating sex on the middle-school dance floor. How do you solve a problem like adolescence? Is there anything schools can do?  The move toward middle schools, after the push for junior high that started in the late 19th century, was supposed to create environments that were more serious than the story-hour life of elementary schools, though less impersonal and confidence-zapping than the controlled chaos of high schools.  While middle schools still have their defenders, they have fallen out of favor after various studies showed that they actually sapped self-esteem and fostered bullying. And academically, performance on standardized tests plummeted from fourth to eighth grades.  Some argue the problem is adolescence itself. But Jaana Juvonen, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an author of a 2004 Rand Corporation report largely critical of middle schools, said that claim ignores international evidence. Canadian students, for example, outperform their counterparts in the United States, and report liking school better. ''If it were truly biological,'' she said, ''we would see similar kinds of behavior happening across similar cultures.''  Returning middle grades to K-8 schools, she believes, would address some behavioral problems. Because some girls look like women at 13, ''we assume that they are more cognitively and socially mature, but we may be misled,'' she said. The earlier these students are put among older students, she added, ''the earlier they start doing various kinds of risky behavior.''  Leon Botstein, president of Bard College and a longtime proponent of restructuring high schools, criticizes middle schools as ''babysitting masked as learning.''  ''The curriculum has been so dumbed down, there's no alternative to the allure of pop culture,'' he said. ''The bumping and grinding on the dance floor is not a reflection of moral degradation; it's because there's a vacuum.''  The same problems don't exist, he said, among students who take a deep interest in extracurricular activities like chess or music. Mr. Botstein, who has long argued to abolish the last two years of high school, would reorganize schools into two segments: kindergarten through sixth grade, and 7th through 10th grades. But even those who argue for changing grade structures warn that it may not be the complete answer. In a study of the Philadelphia schools, which have a mix of middle and K-8 schools, academic achievement remained consistent between the two models, said Christopher Weiss, a sociologist at Columbia and an author of a paper comparing them.  ''No one has ever really been happy with the kind of schooling dedicated to ages 12-15,'' Mr. Weiss said, ''We're in this constant churning. In 20 years we could be having the same conversation about the return of the middle school.''  Rather than moving students between buildings or reconfiguring grades, he said, it might make more sense to spend money to hire more guidance counselors, or to consider curriculum changes.  Ms. Juvonen argues that ''looping,'' where the same teacher follows the same group of students through several grades, could help provide extra support. And research shows that volunteering may work: children who used to being helped take pride in becoming the helpers.  Proponents of middle schools also argue that too much focus has been on the organization of schools.  ''Historically, there's been this notion that middle-school advocates were advocating for a more personalized environment, and that's it,'' said Anthony Jackson, a co-author of ''Turning Points,'' a 1989 Carnegie Corporation report considered the most vigorous defense of the middle school. ''That's never been the case.''  In a follow-up report in 2000, the authors emphasized the need for more academic rigor, including higher standards and more teacher training.  ''People heard the message about a more personal environment, but they didn't hear the part about why we're doing it, which is that we need to be able to instruct kids better,'' he said. ''You can move people into different boxes pretty easily, but the real changes are much harder.''  THE NATION  ",

            "text": "  Scorecard, Not Scores  My son is a student at a Miami prep school for children with learning issues. His SAT scores, after much tutoring, averaged 900 on the verbal and math sections. He has a great grade point average -- 3.6 (no Advanced Placement) -- but is simply a terrible test-taker, even with untimed allowances. Do you have suggestions for resources that will help us choose a college that cares more about hard work and perseverance than SATs? He would like a school in a warm climate, and he is an excellent golfer, probably could play on a Division III team.  Robin Polsky,  Coral Gables, Fla.  THANKS to a growing trend, your son can start thinking about that collegiate hole in one. The SAT and ACT are optional at a lengthening list of colleges that focus more on grades, essays and extracurriculars.  Consult the Web site of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing (fairtest.org) for a list of well over 700 colleges and universities, from Portland State on the West Coast to Drew on the East, that have test-optional policies. The list runs by state as well as alphabetically, so you can do a circuit through the South looking for a Division III school.  David R. Parker, director of the University Program for College Students With Learning Disabilities at the University of Connecticut, suggests treating the search and application process as a training ground for college itself. Your son should investigate his options from golf to whatever services he might need as a student himself. To succeed, Dr. Parker says, any student with a learning disability has to be ''independent and a self-advocate.''  One guide to leaf through is ''Peterson's Colleges With Programs for Students With Learning Disabilities or Attention Deficit Disorder.'' Schwablearning.org, started by the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation, posts articles about navigating school issues. One by Loring Brinckerhoff, director of disability policy at the Educational Testing Service, highlights colleges with good comprehensive programs, including the University of Arizona in Tucson, Curry College in Massachusetts, Stanford and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Older, Not Richer  Do you know of any resources for older (58) people to obtain funds for grad school? Living stipends to attend full time? I am interested in a master's in social work. My preference is to transition into a new career as a middle-school guidance counselor. Another possibility, quite different from the above, is a degree at the Fashion Institute of Technology in jewelry making, repair, gemology, etc. The goal would then be to start a business.  Carol Tannenbaum,  Passaic, N.J.  ATTENDING grad school full time is never easy, but there are almost always financial options short of turning to a life of crime. First, though: financial advisers caution against taking on too much debt so close to traditional retirement age, even if embarking on a new career.  Graduate students can get much the same financial aid as undergraduates -- work-study, federal Stafford loans, merit grants -- but no Pell grants or PLUS loans. And they can borrow a lot more with a Stafford loan than undergraduates can, up to $18,500.  Jacqueline E. King, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the American Council on Education in Washington, warns that graduate programs in professions like social work and fashion tend not to give as much grant money. Academic programs are more generous; they can raise research money, and graduate students offer teaching assistance to large pools of undergraduates.  Dr. King advises to look broadly. For example, the Manufacturing Jewelers and Suppliers of America in Rhode Island offers scholarship money to those working or studying in the field. For your social work goal, if you're willing to work in a critical-need area, the federal government and many states, including New York and New Jersey, offer loan forgiveness programs. For information: www.socialworkers.org.  And though you don't yet qualify, many state schools offer deals for older students. Rutgers allows anyone who is 62 and retired to audit for free an unlimited number of most courses. While you don't get credit, knowledge alone may help you break into a new field. You even get free parking and a school e-mail account.  Have questions on education?

Help  Correction:  January 14, 2007, Sunday  An article in the special Education Life section last Sunday about the large percentage of Asian students at the University of California, Berkeley, attributed an erroneous distinction to the state. Hawaii -- not California -- was the first state without a racial majority.  Also, an article about financial aid for graduate students misstated eligibility for federal PLUS loans. Graduate students may indeed apply for the loans; they became eligible in July 2006.  And an article about rigorous high schools misstated the student newspaper job held by Prateek Kumar of Phillips Academy, who talked about his challenging courses. Mr. Kumar is deputy managing editor of the Phillipian, not the top editor. (Stephen S. Blackman is the editor in chief.)  ",

            "text": "  Sit in with a seventh-grade science class at Seth Low, a cavernous Brooklyn middle school, as paper balls fly and pens are flicked from desk to desk.  A girl is caught with a note and quickly tears it up, blushing, as her classmates chant, ''Read it!'' The teacher, Laura Lowrie, tries to demonstrate simple machines by pulling from a box a hammer, a pencil sharpener and then, to her instant remorse, a nutcracker -- the sight of which sends a cluster of boys into a fit of giggles and anatomical jokes.  ''It's the roughest, toughest, hardest thing to teach,'' Ms. Lowrie said of middle school. ''I'll go home and feel disappointed with what's going on and I'll try a different tactic the next day.'' As for the nutcracker, she sighed, ''I should have used a stapler.''  Driven by newly documented slumps in learning, by crime rates and by high dropout rates in high school, educators across New York and the nation are struggling to rethink middle school and how best to teach adolescents at a transitional juncture of self-discovery and hormonal change.  The difficulty of educating this age group is felt even in many wealthy suburban school districts. But it is particularly intense in cities, where the problems that are compounded in middle school are more acute to begin with and where the search for solutions is most urgent.  In Los Angeles, the new superintendent, David L. Brewer III, has vowed to transform middle schools as a top priority, and low-performing schools are experimenting with intensive counseling.  In Philadelphia and Baltimore, school systems are trying to make the middle school problem literally disappear, by folding grades six through eight into K-8 schools. In one Columbia, S.C., school district, all five middle schools have begun offering some form of single-sex classes, on the theory that they promote self-esteem and reduce distractions.  And middle schools across the five boroughs of New York City are experimenting with a grab bag of strategies, from adding special periods dedicated to organizational skills, to reducing the number of teachers that each student has. At the Brooklyn Secondary School for Collaborative Studies, in Carroll Gardens, which includes grades 6 through 12, school does not start until 9 a.m., because the principal, Alyce Barr, believes adolescents are by nature not morning people.  Middle schools, sometimes called intermediate schools, were created starting in the 1960s, after educators determined that seventh-through-ninth-grade junior high schools were excessively rigid and unattuned to adolescents' personal development. But now, a battery of standardized tests, some required under the No Child Left Behind law, are starkly illustrating that many of these sixth-through-eighth-grade schools are failing, also.  The most recent results of math and reading tests given to students in all 50 states showed that between 1999 and 2004, elementary school students made solid gains in reading and math, while middle school students made smaller gains in math and stagnated in reading.  In New York State, grade-by-grade testing conducted for the first time last year showed that in rich and poor districts alike, reading scores plunge from the fifth to sixth grade, when most students move to middle school, and continue to decline through eighth grade. The pattern is increasingly seen as a critical impediment to tackling early high school dropout rates as well as the achievement gap separating black and white students.  ''If you don't get them hooked into school here, by the time they leave they're gone.'' said Barry M. Fein, the principal of Seth Low.  The troubles transcend test scores. While 74 percent of elementary schools reported at least one violent incident in the 2003-4 school year, 94 percent of middle schools did, federal statistics show.  Mr. Fein spent a recent evening counseling a student who had used a blunt kitchen knife to slash her face and arms: Her wavering self-esteem, it seemed, had ebbed to a low after two friends went out to lunch at McDonald's without her.  ''You handle stuff like that and you go, 'O.K., now you want me to raise test scores?' '' he said. ''They don't really think past tomorrow.''  In New York City, almost every kind of experiment is under way. At Intermediate School 211 in Canarsie, students of all grades are grouped into academies with themes like business and cultural arts based on their interests rather than their age. The principal, Buffie Simmons-Peart, confiscates explicit romance novels with airbrushed covers, saying they have a ''dumbifying'' influence.  I.S. 339, near Claremont Park in the Bronx, is working with Turnaround for Children, a nonprofit group, to focus on the most deeply troubled students, who can have an almost magnetic power over their peers. Nearly every seventh grader has a laptop computer -- an excellent antidote, the principal, Jason Levy, has found, to adolescents' fidgeting and demand for attention.  The city has also been experimenting with grade reconfiguration on a grand scale. Since 2004, the Bloomberg administration has converted 42 elementary schools into K-8 schools and closed 14 traditional middle schools, with plans to close eight more by 2008.  The city has also recently created 38 schools for grades 6-12, another twist on the middle school model. And 44 large middle schools have been carved into ''small learning communities,'' in which groups of students take their classes together, functioning almost as a school within a school.  Andres Alonso, the deputy chancellor for teaching and learning, said the department was also revisiting the way sixth through eighth graders are taught science and noted that it had added $40 million yearly for struggling middle school students. ''The work in the middle schools is extraordinarily important,'' Dr. Alonso said.  At Seth Low -- also known as I.S. 96 -- in the Bensonhurst neighborhood, Mr. Fein is skeptical of the rush for quick answers.  ''Nobody's ever come down and said, 'This works,' '' he said, speaking amid an office cluttered with John Lennon memorabilia, congratulatory plaques and student work like a glittery card reading ''Mr. Fine, He So Fine.''  Mr. Fein worries about test scores because he has to; although some of his students take a special test to get in, his school is listed as failing under No Child Left Behind because it has narrowly missed performance targets for special education students, Hispanics and non-native English speakers. But scores are not exactly his priority.  One recent day, Mr. Fein rode in the back of a police car to a building where a runaway student was hiding out. He climbed to the sixth floor, where he found her, dried her tears and, when she was ready, escorted her down.  Another day, he spent hours arguing with superiors who insisted that a suspended student serve her time at a school in Park Slope, which the principal feared was so far away that the girl would never show up.  Still, Mr. Fein, 58, a former teacher who could have retired three years ago, sticks with it. To cope, he has taken to spending a few predawn minutes meditating in his office, to the glow of candles and a lava lamp.  Students also have to find ways to cope. For sixth graders like Atticus Rollins, 12, a video game and science fiction aficionado, the adjustment to middle school has been a strange mix of empowering and emasculating.  He likes being able to ''walk wherever you want in the hallways'' without having to follow a teacher ina straight line. Still, he said: ''It feels like you're in kindergarten again, because you're the youngest group of all. There are the tall eighth graders, they're like skyscrapers, you have to look up to them.''  For Raechelle Ellison, 11, transition was marked by tears, nightly pleadings to her mother that she did not want to return and the composition of poetry with verses like, ''Life in despair/I don't really care.''  ''Being in middle school is just like a bird being kicked out of its nest by its mother,'' Raechelle mused in the cafeteria one recent morning.  At Raechelle's old school, nearly everyone was black, like her; at Seth Low, which has a mix of black, white, Asian and Hispanic students, she was initially the only black person in her class.  Last year, the private preK-8 school she attended was ''way smaller,'' and she spent most of the day in one classroom, with a single teacher. This year she shuffles from room to room, and it has taken her 10 teachers longer to figure out that her name is neither Rachel nor Rochelle but a unique blend of the two.  Raechelle, with her earnest reflections and pigtails, seems a world away from the eighth graders who rush into the cafeteria two periods later.  Robert Combs, 14, whose mind has already turned to high school and the eighth grade prom, listened to 50 Cent on his iPod. Nazli Sevuk, 14, sported a glittering ring from her boyfriend. Kimberly Basic, 13, with long, dark hair and snug jeans, plotted with friends about what to wear and how to meet up for a night out at a nearby nightclub's under-18 party; she can no longer be bothered with eighth grade boys.  Middle school teachers point to the gulf between the smooth-skinned sixth grade ''babies'' and these eighth-graders on the verge of adulthood, and note how they must guide these students through the profound transformations of adolescence.  ''These kids go through more change in their lives than at any other time except the first three years,'' said Sue Swaim, executive director of the National Middle School Association.  The Seth Low seventh graders have their own theories about why middle school scores plummet.  Nadine George, 12, said she is struggling in science class now because she never understood it in elementary school, despite getting good grades on tests. ''Not that I knew how to do it, but whatever was in my notes I just copied it down,'' she cheerily elaborated.  Jeorge Coronado, 13, said he was distracted now by fights and girls, who were starting to ''look mad good.'' Fabiola Noel, 12, disclosed that during a recent math class, her mind wandered to the look of her hair. In the note that was torn up in science class, Lillian Safa, 13, had asked a friend why a third girl was ignoring her. Two weeks later, Lillian reported, they are once again friends.

            "text": "  AFTER being housed for 20 years in an old junior high school building in Huntington, the Touro Law Center has relocated to a 180,000-square-foot campus in Central Islip. Classes began on Tuesday for the 750 law students in a new building, adjacent to the Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse and the John P. Cohalan Jr. court complex.  Lawrence Raful, the dean of the Touro Law Center, said the school's move to Central Islip is part of the village's master plan to redevelop the area.  ''The area is booming and bringing new life to Central Islip,'' he said. ''With federal and state courthouses as our new neighbors, we form a triangle of three important and complementary legal institutions.''  The four-story law school building, which cost $35 million and is on property Touro bought 10 years ago, includes two trial classrooms, a moot courtroom/auditorium that seats 500, a four-story library and a public advocacy wing that provides space for 14 nonprofit advocacy groups. The law school anticipates reaching agreements with groups that work, for example, on immigration, environmental and housing issues; they would get free rent in return for working with the college's students.  ''These groups will have access to Touro's law students, who in turn will receive hands-on training,'' said Mr. Raful, who called the advocacy program unique among law schools in the country.  The law school's new curriculum, approved by the faculty last year, is a court participation program. First-year students will see cases moving through the courts, and third-year students will try mock cases in real courtrooms before actual judges, Mr. Raful said. ''Other law schools have clinics,'' he said, ''but nothing like this, which is more like a medical school model.''  The Touro Law Center was established in 1980 as part of Touro College. After spending its first few years in Manhattan, the law school moved to Long Island.  NOTICED  ",

            "text": "  On a cold, drizzly evening, the copper-colored track inside the Armory Track and Field Center in Upper Manhattan was as inviting as a crackling fireplace. Hundreds of sprinters and middle-distance runners from public and private high schools were taking wintertime practice, cantering around the indoor track with the exuberance of youngsters taking still-sprouting bodies to once unimaginable peaks.  Among them were Malia McPherson, Dieubi Joinvil and Altagracia Vasquez. But unlike most of the other runners, these three knew that once they changed into street clothes, they would be sitting still for another kind of practice. Two flights down in a high-ceilinged room, they and 35 others would get coaching on the SAT they plan to take on Saturday.  In seven sessions over 10 hours, they have learned not only exotic words like ''nonchalant'' and ''abjure,'' but also canny strategies like eliminating patently wrong choices so guesses will be more focused, thus reducing penalties for wrong answers. ''If you're certain two of the five choices are wrong, then answer that question,'' their teacher Clayton Harding instructed them. ''Then you have a one-in-three chance of getting it right.''  The course, paid for with a $100,000 federal grant, is intended to help poor and immigrant runners in the Armory's program decipher the often complex college admissions process. Malia, Dieubi, Altagracia and the other 35 students have already taken three sessions in which they learned how to choose a college, charm a reader on an essay, scout out financial aid and conduct oneself during an interview.  ''They taught me don't use the word 'like' or don't say 'ummmm,' '' said Malia, a 400-meter runner from Paul Robeson High School in Brooklyn whose parents are immigrants from Haiti and Jamaica. ''Take a deep breath. Try to focus on what you have to say. Be polite, as respectful as possible.''  For such students, the playing field is being leveled -- just a few notches, but in significant ways. Suburban or upscale city youngsters are more likely to afford SAT prep courses that cost $1,000 and up, have parents who have been through the admissions rigmarole, and attend high schools where counselors focus on fewer students.  The Armory students are eager to run faster and vault higher so they can get recruited for college teams, but they know they need baseline SAT scores to pass through the N.C.A.A. Clearinghouse, which monitors eligibility for member colleges. They may not have an uncle who regales them with tales of college days, but they have proven discipline. Try running several miles a day to know what discipline means, said Dr. Norbert Sander, the Armory's president and the winner of the 1974 New York City Marathon.  Even for those students who will never run for a college team, Armory officials are trying to capitalize on the students' passion for track and offer them the benefit of a college prep course. And such courses are essential, since two-thirds of the nation's colleges require SAT or ACT scores.  ''So long as test scores are used for admissions and scholarships, kids should have an equal shot at test prep,'' said Robert A. Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, a persistent critic of SAT-type tests. While the College Board, the sponsor of the SAT, says preparation yields a 35-point improvement in scores, Mr. Schaeffer's organization says the surge is closer to 150 points.  ''If it didn't work, kids would have told their friends and they would not go,'' he said. ''Clearly, coaching works.''  To borrow a track metaphor, students like those at Robeson do not begin at the same starting line as students from the suburbs, though they want to reach the same finishing line. Look at the contrast with a suburban school like Mamaroneck in Westchester County. There, perhaps 70 percent of the students have college-educated parents and perhaps 90 percent buy outside tutoring, Bob Sweeney, a counselor at the school, estimated. ''The guidance service helps students through the maze in filling out applications, helps them put an essay together, points them in the right direction,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''Sometimes the kids are so overwhelmed by paperwork they just can't get started.''  Counselors at public urban high schools may do as good a job, but they are ''swamped,'' said Richard Carlin, an assistant coach at Sheepshead Bay High School who helps Armory runners with their essays. A typical public school counselor handles 300 students, not the 185 in Mamaroneck.  Until Malia and Dieubi and most of the other students began the coaching, college was a fuzzy place on the horizon, as dreamlike as a royal palace, and the road toward it might as well have been hidden by jungle. In many cases, parents could not help find the path. Dieubi, 17, a middle-distance runner at Wingate Educational Campus in Brooklyn, said his mother, a Haitian immigrant who did not complete high school, ''can offer me moral support or tell me whether a decision is right or not, but other than that she doesn't know about the logistics of application or financial aid.''  DAVID CANTOR, a spokesman for the city's Department of Education, said many high schools offer SAT coaching in or after school. But these programs can be sparse and spotty. Yet parents from poor and working-class families may not be able to afford to sign their children up for Princeton Review-type courses.  ''These kids' parents do not have the kind of money to pay,'' said Horace Sutherland, Robeson's track coach.  Though 1,500 students from 50 high schools practice at the Armory every afternoon, the foundation works with just 150, using ProTesters, a tutoring organization run by Mr. Harding, who worked for Princeton Review. He likes to turn math problems into problems about money, which is not abstract to youngsters accustomed to buying clothes and snacks. When the question is 5/9 of what number is 60, Mr. Harding disguises the problem as one about buying uniforms for a baseball team when someone has already paid for four uniforms and needs to buy five more.  The question a program like Armory's raises is why, if college has become as necessary as high school was a half century ago, aren't more public high school students -- and not just athletes -- receiving this kind of assistance? Even here, the students get only 10 hours of SAT practice, a sharp contrast to as many as 30 hours they would get at Princeton Review. But that is far better than zero hours.  The program began four years ago, and there are no results yet. Derrick Adkins, a 1996 Olympic hurdles gold medalist who directs the foundation's educational development, said that before ProTesters was hired, the Armory used Columbia students whose high SAT scores sometimes did not equip them to understand issues facing students with very low ones.  One thing seems clear. Students like James Hubbard like the idea that the prep courses are given in a setting different from school. ''It gives us a chance to get away from school and it lets us know that besides school there are more people out there who care about us,'' he said.  ON EDUCATION E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com  ",

            "text": "  THE 3-year-olds sat in a circle on a bright, multicolored rug as their teacher, Jessie Fujanesi, passed around a shoebox and asked each child to choose an item and describe it.  ''It's a little shoe,'' one girl said. ''It's white.''  ''Un cubierto,'' a boy said, after fishing a plastic fork out of the box. ''Es blanco.''  Soon they were counting to 10, then singing the alphabet song. The Little School here looks like any other nursery program, with the requisite ''circle time,'' stories, crafts, snacks and music (except Spanish and English are used in lessons on alternate days). Something larger, however, is going on in this classroom. Its administrators describe it as nothing less than social justice. The nursery school is an attempt to close what administrators here say is a significant achievement gap among preschool children.  As 5-year-olds enter kindergarten, the effects of poverty are already evident, both in language development and in parental involvement, said Zoila Tazi, principal of pre-school education for the Ossining Union Free School District.  ''Poor children have on average many fewer words than middle-class children,'' Ms. Tazi said. ''Quite literally there's an impoverishment of words. By the time they get to kindergarten, it will already be about catch-up.''  Ms. Tazi said she was disturbed to find kindergartners arriving at school not even knowing their colors. Several years ago, the district decided that the only way to tackle the problem was to intervene early. They started a family literacy program called First Steps, a comprehensive approach to reach out to parents, particularly immigrants living in poverty, and help them foster an atmosphere at home that is conducive to learning.  The message to parents is consistent: read, read and read to your child, and talk, talk and talk to your child. The literacy program is based on the belief that parents are a child's first and most influential teachers, and the more they teach, the stronger the attachment. Mothers and fathers are shown how to make reading more enriching -- stopping at a word the child may not know to discuss it, pointing to pictures, talking about what may happen next -- the kinds of things that may seem to come naturally if you were read to often as a young child, but which are really learned skills.  Parents are encouraged to speak their native language at home. Not only is it easier to teach English to a child who has a strong foundation in another language, experts say, but parents who speak fluently also tend to be closer to their children.  Something that was critical from the outset was the tone and philosophy of the program, Ms. Tazi said. First Steps is billed as a remediation program, not as enrichment. The district tries to reach families as soon as a baby is born. A nurse will visit the home, and a family specialist will work with parents in their homes. Addressing health and family issues early is an important component of addressing the academic achievement gap, because, Ms. Tazi said, ''you can't separate out the emotional from the cognitive from the physical,'' especially in the early years.  First Steps not only includes the Little School, but also offers so many classes that it needs a monthly calendar. There is a series of ''mommy/daddy and me'' events, and for children, there are library trips, classes in art, music, dance, writing and cooking, and math and science clubs. There is adult literacy, with a focus on teaching parents the language skills they need to help their children with homework and participate in activities like teacher conferences and Back to School nights. There are also parenting workshops.  The program is a partnership between private foundations and the Ossining School District. Programs for children younger than prekindergarten are financed privately. The Little School serves 75 children ''in need,'' predominantly those living in poverty, but also children who have illness in their family or other stressful home situations. The idea behind the dual language approach is that the Hispanic children tend to be poorest and need a solid foundation in their first language, but that other children will benefit from the dual language approach as well.  On Mondays, parents accompany their children to the Little School. On a recent visit, everyone read ''The Little Red Hen.'' In a crafts activity, children glued white Styrofoam bits onto black paper. Just when the children were getting restless, it was music time. Even the song taught words. The children were told to move like elephants, then birds, then monkeys, then snakes. It looked like fun. But to Ms. Tazi it looked like something else.  ''We think this school has an awful lot of capacity to make a difference,'' she said. ''For us, this is a moral imperative.''  Correction:  February 4, 2007, Sunday  Because of an editing error, a column last Sunday about First Steps, a family literacy program in Ossining, misstated its philosophy. First Steps is billed as an enrichment program, not a remediation program.  ",

            "text": "  WHEN Jonathan Hu was going to high school in suburban Southern California, he rarely heard anyone speaking Chinese. But striding through campus on his way to class at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Hu hears Mandarin all the time, in plazas, cafeterias, classrooms, study halls, dorms and fast-food outlets. It is part of the soundtrack at this iconic university, along with Cantonese, English, Spanish and, of course, the perpetual jackhammers from the perpetual construction projects spurred by the perpetual fund drives.  ''Here, many people speak Chinese as their primary language,'' says Mr. Hu, a sophomore. ''It's nice. You really feel like you don't stand out.''  Today, he is iPod-free, a rare condition on campus, taking in the early winter sun at the dour concrete plaza of the Free Speech Movement Cafe, named for the protests led by Mario Savio in 1964, when the administration tried to muzzle political activity. ''Free speech marks us off from the stones and stars,'' reads a Savio quote on the cafe wall, ''just below the angels.''  There are now mostly small protests, against the new chain stores invading Telegraph Avenue, just outside the campus entrance, and to save the old oak trees scheduled for removal so the football stadium can be renovated. The biggest buzz on Telegraph one week was the grand opening of a chain restaurant -- the new Chipotle's, which drew a crowd of students eager to get in. The scent of patchouli oil and reefer is long gone; the street is posted as a drug-free zone.  And at least on this morning, there is very little speech of any kind inside the Free Speech Cafe; almost without exception, students are face-planted in their laptops, silently downloading class notes, music, messages. It could be the library but for the line for lattes. On mornings like this, the public university beneath the towering campanile seems like a small, industrious city of \u00fcber-students in flops.  I ask Mr. Hu what it's like to be on a campus that is overwhelmingly Asian -- what it's like to be of the demographic moment. This fall and last, the number of Asian freshmen at Berkeley has been at a record high, about 46 percent. The overall undergraduate population is 41 percent Asian. On this golden campus, where a creek runs through a redwood grove, there are residence halls with Asian themes; good dim sum is never more than a five-minute walk away; heaping, spicy bowls of pho are served up in the Bear's Lair cafeteria; and numerous social clubs are linked by common ancestry to countries far across the Pacific.  Mr. Hu shrugs, saying there is a fair amount of ''selective self-racial segregation,'' which is not unusual at a university this size: about 24,000 undergraduates. ''The different ethnic groups don't really interact that much,'' he says. ''There's definitely a sense of sticking with your community.'' But, he quickly adds, ''People of my generation don't look at race as that big of a deal. People here, the freshmen and sophomores, they're pretty much like your average American teenagers.''  Spend a few days at Berkeley, on the classically manicured slope overlooking San Francisco Bay and the distant Pacific, and soon enough the sound of foreign languages becomes less distinct. This is a global campus in a global age. And more than any time in its history, it looks toward the setting sun for its identity.  The revolution at Berkeley is a quiet one, a slow turning of the forces of immigration and demographics. What is troubling to some is that the big public school on the hill certainly does not look like the ethnic face of California, which is 12 percent Asian, more than twice the national average. But it is the new face of the state's vaunted public university system. Asians make up the largest single ethnic group, 37 percent, at its nine undergraduate campuses.  The oft-cited goal of a public university is to be a microcosm -- in this case, of the nation's most populous, most demographically dynamic state -- and to enrich the educational experience with a variety of cultures, economic backgrounds and viewpoints.  But 10 years after California passed Proposition 209, voting to eliminate racial preferences in the public sector, university administrators find such balance harder to attain. At the same time, affirmative action is being challenged on a number of new fronts, in court and at state ballot boxes. And elite colleges have recently come under attack for practicing it -- specifically, for bypassing highly credentialed Asian applicants in favor of students of color with less stellar test scores and grades.  In California, the rise of the Asian campus, of the strict meritocracy, has come at the expense of historically underrepresented blacks and Hispanics. This year, in a class of 4809, there are only 100 black freshmen at the University of California at Los Angeles -- the lowest number in 33 years. At Berkeley, 3.6 percent of freshmen are black, barely half the statewide proportion. (In 1997, just before the full force of Proposition 209 went into effect, the proportion of black freshmen matched the state population, 7 percent.) The percentage of Hispanic freshmen at Berkeley (11 percent) is not even a third of the state proportion (35 percent). White freshmen (29 percent) are also below the state average (44 percent).  This is in part because getting into Berkeley -- U.S. News & World Report's top-ranked public university -- has never been more daunting. There were 41,750 applicants for this year's freshman class of 4,157. Nearly half had a weighted grade point average of 4.0 or better (weighted for advanced courses). There is even grumbling from ''the old Blues'' -- older alumni named for the school color -- ''who complain because their kids can't get in,'' says Gregg Thomson, director of the Office of Student Research.  Mr. Hu applied to a lot of colleges, but Berkeley felt right for him from the start. ''It's the intellectual atmosphere -- this place is intense.''  Mr. Hu says he was pressured by a professor to go into something like medicine or engineering. ''It's a stereotype, but a lot of Asians who come here just study engineering and the sciences,'' he says. ''I was never interested in that.''  But as the only son of professionals born in China, Mr. Hu fits the profile of Asians at Berkeley in at least one way: they are predominantly first-generation American. About 95 percent of Asian freshmen come from a family in which one or both parents were born outside the United States.  He dashes off to class, and I wander through the serene setting of Memorial Glade, in the center of campus, and then loop over to Sproul Plaza, the beating heart of the university, where dozens of tables are set up by clubs representing every conceivable ethnic group. Out of nowhere, an a cappella group, mostly Asian men, appears and starts singing a Beach Boys song. Yes, tradition still matters in California.  ACROSS the United States, at elite private and public universities, Asian enrollment is near an all-time high. Asian-Americans make up less than 5 percent of the population but typically make up 10 to 30 percent of students at the nation's best colleges:in 2005, the last year with across-the-board numbers, Asians made up 24 percent of the undergraduate population at Carnegie Mellon and at Stanford, 27 percent at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 14 percent at Yale and 13 percent at Princeton.  And according to advocates of race-neutral admissions policies, those numbers should be even higher.  Asians have become the ''new Jews,'' in the phrase of Daniel Golden, whose recent book, ''The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges -- and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates,'' is a polemic against university admissions policies. Mr. Golden, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is referring to evidence that, in the first half of the 20th century, Ivy League schools limited the number of Jewish students despite their outstanding academic records to maintain the primacy of upper-class Protestants. Today, he writes, ''Asian-Americans are the odd group out, lacking racial preferences enjoyed by other minorities and the advantages of wealth and lineage mostly accrued by upper-class whites. Asians are typecast in college admissions offices as quasi-robots programmed by their parents to ace math and science.''  As if to illustrate the point, a study released in October by the Center for Equal Opportunity, an advocacy group opposing race-conscious admissions, showed that in 2005 Asian-Americans were admitted to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, at a much lower rate (54 percent) than black applicants (71 percent) and Hispanic applicants (79 percent) -- despite median SAT scores that were 140 points higher than Hispanics and 240 points higher than blacks.  To force the issue on a legal level, a freshman at Yale filed a complaint in the fall with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, contending he was denied admission to Princeton because he is Asian. The student, Jian Li, the son of Chinese immigrants in Livingston, N.J., had a perfect SAT score and near-perfect grades, including numerous Advanced Placement courses.  ''This is just a very, very egregious system,'' Mr. Li told me. ''Asians are held to different standards simply because of their race.''  To back his claim, he cites a 2005 study by Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang Y. Chung, both of Princeton, which concludes that if elite universities were to disregard race, Asians would fill nearly four of five spots that now go to blacks or Hispanics. Affirmative action has a neutral effect on the number of whites admitted, Mr. Li is arguing, but it raises the bar for Asians. The way Princeton selects its entering class, Mr. Li wrote in his complaint, ''seems to be a calculated move by a historically white institution to protect its racial identity while at the same time maintaining a facade of progressivism.''  Private institutions can commit to affirmative action, even with state bans, but federal money could be revoked if they are found to be discriminating. Mr. Li is seeking suspension of federal financial assistance to Princeton. ''I'm not seeking anything personally,'' he says. ''I'm happy at Yale. But I grew up thinking that in America race should not matter.''  Admissions officials have long denied that they apply quotas. Nonetheless, race is important ''to ensure a diverse student body,'' says Cass Cliatt, a Princeton spokeswoman. But, she adds, ''Looking at the merits of race is not the same as the opposite'' -- discrimination.  Elite colleges like Princeton review the ''total package,'' in her words, looking at special talents, extracurricular interests and socioeconomics -- factors like whether the applicant is the first in the family to go to college or was raised by a single mother. ''There's no set formula or standard for how we evaluate students,'' she says. High grades and test scores would seem to be merely a baseline. ''We turned away approximately half of applicants with maximum scores on the SAT, all three sections,'' Ms. Cliatt says of the class Mr. Li would have joined.  In the last two months, the nation has seen a number of new challenges to racial engineering in schools. In November, the United States Supreme Court heard a case questioning the legality of using race in assigning students to public schools in Seattle and Louisville, Ky. Voters are also sending a message, having thrown out racial preferences in Michigan in November, following a lead taken by California, Texas, Florida and Washington. Last month, Ward Connerly, the architect of Proposition 209, announced his next potential targets for a ballot initiative, including Arizona, Colorado, Missouri and Nebraska.  When I ask the chancellor at Berkeley, Robert J. Birgeneau, if there is a perfect demographic recipe on this campus that likes to think of itself as the world's finest public university -- Harvard on the Hill -- he demurs.  ''We are a meritocracy,'' he says. And -- by law, he adds -- the campus is supposed to be that way. If Asians made up, say, 70 percent of the campus, he insists, there would still be no attempt to reduce their numbers.  Asian enrollment at his campus actually began to ramp up well before affirmative action was banned.  Historically, Asians have faced discrimination, with exclusion laws in the 1800s that kept them from voting, owning property or legally immigrating. Many were run out of West Coast towns by mobs. But by the 1970s and '80s, with a change in immigration laws, a surge in Asian arrivals began to change the complexion of California, and it was soon reflected in an overrepresentation at its top universities.  In the late 1980s, administrators appeared to be limiting Asian-American admissions, prompting a federal investigation. The result was an apology by the chancellor at the time, and a vow that there would be no cap on Asian enrollment.  University administrators and teachers use anguished words to describe what has happened since.  ''I've heard from Latinos and blacks that Asians should not be considered a minority at all,'' says Elaine Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at Berkeley. ''What happened after they got rid of affirmative action has been a disaster -- for blacks and Latinos. And for Asians it's been a disaster because some people think the campus has become all-Asian.''  The diminishing number of African-Americans on campus is a consistent topic of discussion among black students. Some say they feel isolated, without a sense of community. ''You really do feel like you stand out,'' says Armilla Staley, a second-year law student. In her freshman year, she was one of only nine African-Americans in a class of 265. ''I'm almost always the only black person in my class,'' says Ms. Staley, who favors a return to some form of affirmative action.  ''Quite frankly, when you walk around campus, it's overwhelmingly Asian,'' she says. ''I don't feel any tension between Asians and blacks, but I don't really identify with the Asian community as a minority either.''  Walter Robinson, the director of undergraduate admissions, who is African-American, has the same impression. ''The problem is that because we're so few, we get absorbed among the masses,'' he says.  Chancellor Birgeneau says he finds the low proportion of blacks and Hispanics appalling, and two years into his tenure, he has not found a remedy. To broaden the pool, the U.C. system promises to admit the top 4 percent at each high school in the state and uses ''comprehensive review'' -- considering an applicant's less quantifiable attributes. But the net results for a campus like Berkeley are disappointing. His university, Dr. Birgeneau says, loses talented black applicants to private universities like Stanford, where African-American enrollment was 10 percent last year -- nearly three times that at Berkeley.  ''I just don't believe that in a state with three million African-Americans there is not a single engineering student for the state's premier public university,'' says the chancellor, who has called for reinstating racial preferences.  One leading critic of bringing affirmative action back to Berkeley is David A. Hollinger, chairman of its history department and author of ''Post-Ethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism.'' He supported racial preferences before Proposition 209, but is no longer so sure. ''You could argue that the campus is more diverse now,'' because Asians comprise so many different cultures, says Dr. Hollinger. A little more than half of Asian freshmen at Berkeley are Chinese, the largest group, followed by Koreans, East-Indian/Pakistani, Filipino and Japanese.  He believes that Latinos are underrepresented because many come from poor agrarian families with little access to the good schools that could prepare them for the rigors of Berkeley. He points out that, on the other hand, many of the Korean students on campus are sons and daughters of parents with college degrees. In any event, he says, it is not the university's job to fix the problems that California's public schools produce.  Dr. Birgeneau agrees on at least one point: ''I think we're now at the point where the category of Asian is not very useful. Koreans are different from people from Sri Lanka and they're different than Japanese. And many Chinese-Americans are a lot like Caucasians in some of their values and areas of interest.''  IF Berkeley is now a pure meritocracy, what does that say about the future of great American universities in the post-affirmative action age? Are we headed toward a day when all elite colleges will look something like Berkeley: relatively wealthy whites (about 60 percent of white freshmen's families make $100,000 or more) and a large Asian plurality and everyone else underrepresented? Is that the inevitable result of color-blind admissions?  Eric Liu, author of ''The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native Speaker'' and a domestic policy adviser to former President Bill Clinton, is troubled by the assertion that the high Asian makeup of elite campuses reflects a post-racial age where merit prevails.  ''I really challenge this idea of a pure meritocracy,'' says Mr. Liu, who runs mentoring programs that grew out of his book ''Guiding Lights: How to Mentor and Find Life's Purpose.'' Until all students -- from rural outposts to impoverished urban settings -- are given equal access to the Advanced Placement classes that have proved to be a ticket to the best colleges, then the idea of pure meritocracy is bunk, he says. ''They're measuring in a fair way the results of an unfair system.''  He also says Asian-Americans are tired of having to live up to -- or defend -- ''that tired old warhorse of the model minority.''  ''We shouldn't be calling these studying habits that help so many kids get into good schools 'Asian values,' '' says Mr. Liu, himself a product of Yale College and Harvard Law School. ''These are values that used to be called Jewish values or Anglo-Saxon work-ethic values. The bottom line message from the family is the same: work hard, defer gratification, share sacrifice and focus on the big goal.''  Hazel R. Markus lectures on this very subject as a professor of psychology at Stanford and co-director of its Research Institute for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. Her studies have found that Asian students do approach academics differently. Whether educated in the United States or abroad, she says, they see professors as authority figures to be listened to, not challenged in the back-and-forth Socratic tradition. ''You hear some teachers say that the Asian kids get great grades but just sit there and don't participate,'' she says. ''Talking and thinking are not the same thing. Being a student to some Asians means that it's not your place to question, and that flapping your gums all day is not the best thing.''  One study at the institute looked at Asian-American students in lab courses, and found they did better solving problems alone and without conversations with other students. ''This can make for some big problems,'' she says, like misunderstandings between classmates. ''But people are afraid to talk about these differences. And one of the fantastic opportunities of going to a Stanford or Berkeley is to learn something about other cultures, so we should be talking about it.''  As for the rise in Asian enrollment, the reason ''isn't a mystery,'' Dr. Markus says. ''This needs to come out and we shouldn't hide it,'' she says. ''In Asian families, the No. 1 job of a child is to be a student. Being educated -- that's the most honorable thing you can do.''  BERKELEY is ''Asian heaven,'' as one student puts it. ''When I went back East my Asian friends were like, 'Wow, you go to Berkeley -- that must be great,' '' says Tera Nakata, who just graduated and now works in the residence halls.  You need only go to colleges in, say, the Midwest to appreciate the Asian feel of this campus. But Berkeley is freighted with the baggage of stereotypes -- that it is boring socially, full of science nerds, a hard place to make friends.  ''About half the students at this school spend their entire career in the library,'' one person wrote in a posting on vault.com, a popular job and college search Web site.  Another wrote: ''Everyone who is white joins the Greek system and everyone who isn't joins a 'theme house' or is a member of a club related to race.''  There is some truth to the image, students acknowledge, but it does not do justice to the bigger experience at Berkeley. ''You have the ability to stay with people who are like you and not get out of your comfort zone,'' says Ms. Nakata. ''But I learned a lot by mixing it up. I lived in a dorm with a lot of different races, and we would have these deep conversations all the time about race and our feelings of where we belong and where we came from.'' But she also says that the ''celebrate diversity aspect'' of Berkeley doesn't go deep. ''We want to respect everyone's differences, but we don't mix socially.''  Near the end of my stay at Berkeley I met a senior, Jonathan Lee, the son of a Taiwanese father and a mother from Hong Kong. He grew up well east of Los Angeles, in the New America sprawl of fast-growing Riverside County, where his father owned a restaurant. He went to a high school where he was a minority.  ''When I was in high school,'' he says, ''there was this notion that you're Chinese, you must be really good in math.'' But now Mr. Lee is likely to become a schoolteacher, much to the chagrin of his parents, ''who don't think it will be very lucrative.''  The story of Jon Lee's journey at Berkeley is compelling. As president of the Asian-American Association, he has tried to dispel stereotypes of ''the Dragon Lady seductress or the idea that everybody plays the piano.'' His closest friends are in the club. It may seem that he has become more insular, that he has found his tribe. But Mr. Lee says he has been trying to lead other Asian students out of the university bubble. Once a week, they go into a mostly black and Hispanic middle school in the Bay Area to mentor students.  For the last five semesters, Mr. Lee has worked with one student. ''I take him out for dim sum, or to Chinatown, or just talk about college and what it's like at Cal,'' he says. ''We talk about race and we talk about everything. And he's taught me a lot.''  The mentoring program came about not because of prodding by well-meaning advisers, teachers or student groups. It came about because Mr. Lee looked around at the new America -- in California, the first state with no racial majority -- and found that it looked very different from Berkeley. And much as he loves Berkeley, he knew that if he wanted to learn enough to teach, he needed to get off campus.  Timothy Egan reports for The Times from the West Coast. He won a 2006 National Book Award for ''The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl.''  Correction:  January 14, 2007, Sunday  An article in the special Education Life section last Sunday about the large percentage of Asian students at the University of California, Berkeley, attributed an erroneous distinction to the state. Hawaii -- not California -- was the first state without a racial majority.  Also, an article about financial aid for graduate students misstated eligibility for federal PLUS loans. Graduate students may indeed apply for the loans; they became eligible in July 2006.  And an article about rigorous high schools misstated the student newspaper job held by Prateek Kumar of Phillips Academy, who talked about his challenging courses. Mr. Kumar is deputy managing editor of the Phillipian, not the top editor. (Stephen S. Blackman is the editor in chief.)  ",

(Week in Review, Jan. 21), you report on a variety of expert explanations as to why college-educated men and women marry in greater numbers than their non-college-educated counterparts. But the analysis leaves out one salient possibility: college or graduate school as a social space.  I am in my 20s, and of my married, college-educated friends, the majority first met their spouses in college or graduate school. The social environment outside of college is simply less conducive to finding a like-minded spouse; the effects of college life should not be discounted.  L.

            "text": "  The Montfort Academy, a Catholic high school for boys in Katonah, opened in 2002 with the goal of offering what it calls a classical education and, as it says on its Web site, ''Forming Men for All Seasons.''  But in September, the school -- which last year graduated its first full class of boys -- will start a similar, but separate, program for girls. The girls' program will start the way the boys' did, with a ninth-grade class and adding a ninth grade each year as the other classes move up.  ''We talk about men of excellence and virtue, I think what we want to talk about with girls is women of wisdom and virtue,'' said David Petrillo, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who was headmaster of the school until becoming president on Jan. 1. ''Women tend to shape our culture, and they do it through a certain kind of wisdom.''  The educational philosophy for the girls will be the same as it is for the boys, he said. At Montfort, teaching is rooted in the development of Western civilization, with the writings of Plato and Aristotle serving as a starting point. Grammar, logic and rhetoric are stressed as tools for developing ideas and the skills of debate.  The school, located in a former Catholic grammar school, has 40 students in all four grades and charges tuition of $11,500 a year. It was founded by Richard Greco Jr., a graduate of the Bronxville public schools who until October was assistant secretary of the Navy. Mr. Greco, who honed the idea for a private Catholic high school while working for the investment firm Stern Stewart & Company, said he opened Montfort in response to what he perceived to be an environment calling for a return to the classical curriculum of traditional Catholic education.  With space opening up on the lower level (a Montessori school is leaving), the board initially decided against starting a girls' program. They reconsidered after being approached by Eric Meyer, a father of four -- the oldest an eighth-grade girl -- who offered to pay for the expansion.  ''I heard one of the courses being taught was chivalry,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''In this age of informality, that resonated with me.''  In search of a high school with a high ratio of teachers to students, and an education moored in classic books and basics like grammar and logic, he met with officials at Montfort to see if he could be of help in getting the girls' program off the ground.  Mr. Meyer, the president of Shariah Capital, in New Canaan, Conn., which specializes in investments based on Islamic law, declined to discuss how much money he was giving to the school, beyond saying he had offered to be a key supporting member.  ''I'm willing to do what it takes to get the girls' school up and running for September,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''How can you know the present if you don't know the past? I love the idea they start with the best books, the best sellers of really the beginning of civilization, and move forward from there. What a firm foundation for the future.''  ",

            "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''A School Search Shaded by Painful Memories,'' by Benilde Little (Generations, Jan. 7):  As head of school for St. Philip's Academy, and father (I am black, my wife is white) of three young children adopted from Guatemala, I know all too well the difficulties of choosing the right school for a child. I am sad that Ms. Little did not have the opportunity to look at our school as an alternative.  St. Philip's is a K-8 private inner-city school that accepts students based on academic motivation and regardless of their family's ability to pay tuition. Thus, we embrace a more holistic kind of diversity, not only racial, but socioeconomic as well.  Our students come from a wide array of family circumstances and adversity, some from shelters each morning, some from comfortable homes. Yet, what allows our students to reach their full potential is our belief that all children are equal and, given the proper individual nurturing and support, will succeed.  I call on all schools and communities to create environments that build self-esteem, enthusiasm and integrity as the platform for high achievement for all.  Miguel J. Brito  Newark  ",

            "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''Bumping in Schools'' (editorial, Dec. 27):  As a veteran teacher in private schools, I was delighted when the school district in Philadelphia negotiated to allow some schools to practice on-site selection of teachers instead of the seniority placement system described in your editorial.  What had kept me out of public urban education was the prospect of teaching at a school whose faculty and administration were not reform-minded. I wanted my efforts to be supported, but under the seniority-based system of placement, my desire to be part of positive change was irrelevant.  Why would a well-meaning principal try to be a reformer? He or she would have no hand in selecting the faculty.  I now work with like-minded colleagues and administrators in a Philadelphia public school, but it was possible only when an alternative to the seniority-based placement system was created.  Matthew C. Baird  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  To the Editor:  Finding teachers for the neediest classrooms is a challenge for many school districts.  Regrettably, and all too often, assignments to these positions are seen as the ''dues'' new teachers must pay before they can work their way through the system and transfer to schools considered to be more desirable.  One way to curb this trend would be to limit the percentage of novice teachers that can be assigned to high-needs schools and to provide a higher level of support for beginning teachers in these positions.  It would also help if schools serving the neediest children were directed by experienced and highly qualified administrators.  Howard Miller  Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is an associate professor of literacy education at Mercy College.  To the Editor:  The ''bumping'' process that you describe is bogus.  The seniority rule regarding assignment to a school is: if a vacancy occurs, it is filled by seniority. Even this procedure has been watered down by the site-selection process, in which teachers must interview for a vacant position and seniority plays no part.  The idea that teachers change schools willy-nilly at their own choice is a myth.  John Jaros  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is a teacher.  ",

            "text": "  Not long ago, a freshman was kicked off the Manhattanville College men's basketball team because of poor grades. Now he is the head coach.  ''I never went to class -- never,'' Pat Scanlon, the 25-year-old coach, said of the first semester of his freshman year.  ''Academics had always been the source of such problems for me,'' he said, ''and this was the worst.''  And now his players are paying for it. Practices frequently start at 5:45 a.m. Scanlon and his assistants have been known to peek into classroom windows to count their players, or even call them on their cellphones if he thinks they are dozing off during class.  Scanlon does this because he is intent on helping his players avoid the academic problems he encountered. And he knows that improvement is possible.  Scanlon pulled off an academic turnaround, earning an award for academic distinction by his senior year, by which time he was back in good standing on the basketball team. Within a few years, at age 23, he was named head coach, replacing the former Knicks player Dean Meminger.  Scanlon managed to revive his academic standing, he said, with the help of a few others, including his coach, Ian Curtin; a history professor, Lawson Bowling; and his girlfriend at the time, Stefanie Tropea, who is now his fianc\u00e9e.  When Scanlon's poor grades forced him off the team, Curtin, now the athletic director at St. Joseph's College of Maine, said he saw potential in Scanlon and allowed him to remain tethered to the team. He watched practices and sat on the bench in street clothes during games.  ''I thought if he had to do XYZ to do what he loved, he would,'' Curtin said.  Around that time, Scanlon received a letter from a professor he hardly knew. One of the classes Scanlon often skipped was Bowling's history class. Bowling said he was impressed by a paper Scanlon wrote for the class, and he wrote Scanlon a letter explaining that if he could ever manage to harness his academic potential, he would go from washout to accomplished student.  ''It is really the old saw about how a work ethic can be applied across the board,'' Bowling said.  Then there was Tropea, the academically inclined girlfriend.  ''One day I was in class, writing and writing,'' Tropea said. ''I looked next to me where Pat was and there wasn't one word written. This is a history class, text-based. I said to him, 'Oh, I'll have to borrow your notes.' ''  Then she issued a challenge. ''I said, 'I bet you can't get a higher grade than me on the next test.' ''  He did not, but he came close. And he was on his way to becoming an A student with a spot on the dean's list.  Now he is using his story as a real-life example for his athletes. Manhattanville is 12-4 this season and has received votes in a Division III top-25 poll.  ''I tried everything, from bribery to extortion,'' Don Scanlon Jr. said about how he responded to his son's academic missteps.  But in the end, he said, ''You have to love them; you don't have to understand them.''  COLLEGE BASKETBALL  ",

            "text": "  Offline Options For Backup  Q. What are the alternatives for backing up a computer's data if you don't want to use an online service?  A. Online services that let you back up your computer's files to a remote server can put your mind at ease, but they are just one option for stashing copies of your valuable files and folders. Because computer hard drives can be quite large, many people still use the traditional backup method of copying files onto an even larger external hard drive.  Many hard-drive makers include basic backup software with their drives, and you can also buy your own preferred program for Windows or Macintosh at most computer stores. Maxtor, LaCie, Western Digital and Iomega are among the many makers of external drives designed for home users. Prices vary, but it is possible to find a 250-gigabyte external drive for $150 or less on the Web.  Most drives now use the U.S.B. 2.0 connection to copy data between drives at a relatively fast clip. You can usually use a U.S.B. 2.0 drive with an older computer that just has U.S.B. 1.1 ports, but the data-transfer speeds will be much slower. Some backup drives also have FireWire connections, which are found on many Macintosh computers.  Although it is usually not included in the default installation, Windows XP has its own backup software that you can install from your Windows XP system discs. Mac OS X users with .Mac accounts can use Apple's free backup software.  Once you select a drive and install your backup software, you can set it up to back up your files, songs, pictures, videos and other data at regularly scheduled intervals, so if you accidentally delete a file or your computer dies, you have a copy of everything. Depending on how much data you have, most backup programs let you back up your files to a recordable CD or DVD instead of a hard drive.  Smartphones And the Mac  Q. Many of the best new smartphones run Windows Mobile or seem to be otherwise PC-only for synching data. Is there any way to use one with Mac OS X?  A. Smartphones, the Internet-connected hand-helds that combine voice calling with e-mail and other functions, typically allow you to transfer contact and calendar information between Mac and phone. If the smartphone you seek doesn't come with Mac OS X software, you can often find a third-party program that will sync up the phone and your Mac. (Apple's recently announced smartphone, the iPhone, will certainly be compatible with the Mac, but its price, exclusive arrangement with Cingular Wireless and lack of availability until midyear may put it out of contention for many people.)  PocketMac (pocketmac.com) and the Missing Sync (markspace.com) are two families of synchronization programs that let Macs communicate with smartphones and other devices designed for Windows. Both offer software for use with Windows Mobile smartphones, although PocketMac is still working on support for Windows Mobile 5.0; both also have programs, or soon will, designed to sync a Mac to some versions of the BlackBerry hand-held. Expect to pay $20 to $40 for the software, depending on what device you use.  Owners of newer Macs running Intel processors also have the more expensive option of installing Apple's free Boot Camp software and buying a copy of Windows XP to use the system on their Macs. Programs like Parallels Desktop for Mac ($80 at parallels.com) also let you run many Windows programs on a Mac.  Gatekeeping For Pop-Ups  Q. Is there a way to temporarily override the function that blocks pop-up windows in my Web browser to browse sites that legitimately use pop-ups?  A. Most Web browsers -- including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari -- now include a function that blocks the pesky pop-up and pop-under windows favored by advertisers. This feature can cause problems, however, with sites like banks that sometimes use the extra windows for certain functions.  Check your browser's settings or preferences area for the pop-up blocker function. On many versions of Internet Explorer or Firefox, you can choose to allow pop-ups only from certain sites -- and have the browser block the rest. In the Safari browser for Mac OS X, you can quickly turn pop-up blocking off or on with a keyboard shortcut (Command-K) when you get to a site that uses pop-ups you want to see.  J. D.

Like the earlier N770, it lets you browse the Internet, send and receive e-mail and instant messages, download audio and video and get R.S.S. feeds. The N800 adds a Web cam for videoconferencing and a microphone for Internet phone calls.  As a media player, the N800 handles MP3 and Windows Media files and other common audio and video formats, displaying images on a 4.1-inch color screen and playing audio through built-in stereo speakers or a headphone. Content can be loaded from SD or MMC memory cards, streamed from the Web or downloaded through a U.S.B. connection from another computer. The tablet uses Wi-Fi networking, but it can also connect to a compatible Nokia phone via Bluetooth and use it as a wireless modem.  The tablet, available from retailers and www.nokiausa.com for $400, has an on-screen keyboard. It will recognize text written with a stylus, which can also be used for doodling.

            "text": "  Moving It All To Vista  Q. When the time comes, how can I move all of my bookmarks, music and other files from my old computer to a new Windows Vista PC?  A. Windows Vista, scheduled for its debut to the general public next week, includes a free tool called Windows Easy Transfer. Like the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard that came with Windows XP, it is designed to move most of your personal stuff by means of a cable connection between old and new machines. Moving files over a network or with recordable discs and drives are other methods for transferring your files to the Vista PC as well.  According to Microsoft's own description of Windows Easy Transfer (found at support.microsoft.com/kb/928635), the tool can move your user accounts and settings, personal files and folders, e-mail settings, messages and contacts, Internet settings and bookmarks and all your digital music, picture and video files.  It won't move system files like fonts and drivers, however, so you will need to reinstall any custom fonts and Vista-compatible drivers on the new machine yourself.  While Windows Easy Transfer will move program settings and preferences if you have the same programs installed on the new computer, it won't move the programs themselves. (Some types of software, like security programs designed for older versions of Windows, will probably not work on Vista anyway.)  Unfortunately for those with older computers, Windows Easy Transfer is designed to transfer files and settings from older machines running Windows 2000 or later. For Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me and Windows NT users who don't want to move data and reconfigure all their program settings manually, separate software can be a much easier solution.  Several data-migration programs can be found around the Web or in computer stores. For example, Laplink PCmover (www.laplink.com) works with most older versions of Windows, costs less than $60 and is designed to move your files and settings between machines. Laplink PCmover even promises to move your programs as well.  Leaping To Linux  Q. What type of computers can run the Ubuntu Linux system?  A. Ubuntu, a free and flexible version of the Linux operating system, can work on many kinds of computers, including PCs and Macintosh machines with Intel processors. PC hardware with A.M.D. processors and Macs with the older PowerPC chips can also run Ubuntu, as can some high-end workstations and servers used by computer professionals. ''Ubuntu,'' a Zulu and Xhosa word from South Africa, roughly translates to ''humanity to others.''  Because it often has less-demanding hardware requirements than the latest versions of Windows or the Mac operating system, many people have found installing Linux on an older computer can give it a few more years of usefulness.  The standard desktop version of Ubuntu Linux includes a point-and-click graphical interface and programs for word processing, e-mail, Web browsing and other typical tasks. The system can be downloaded free at www.ubuntu.com, where there is much more information on installing and using it.  The Longevity Of Mail Accounts  Q. How long can you go without logging into Yahoo Mail before your account is shut down?  A. Free Web-based e-mail services like Yahoo Mail, MSN Hotmail and Google Gmail now offer at least a gigabyte of mail storage, but you do need to log in every once in awhile to keep the account active. The exact length of time may vary by company, and you should check with your particular mail service for specific details.  In the case of Yahoo, its Web site states that you need to check in at least once every four months before your free account expires. People who pay $20 a year for the premium service, Yahoo Mail Plus, do not have to worry about their accounts expiring. (Yahoo Mail Plus subscribers get more mailbox space, no advertisements on their messages, better spam filters and other perks.)  An account with Microsoft's MSN Hotmail service may expire if not checked at least every 30 days. If you do not log into a Gmail account for an extended period of time, Google will mark your account as dormant and may delete the entire thing after nine months if you have not used it.  J. D.

Sprint Nextel spends an estimated $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion each year on advertising.  Since Sprint acquired Nextel in 2005, the merged company has been using the former Nextel agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, for consumer ads and the former Sprint agency, Publicis & Hal Riney in San Francisco, for business-to-business ads.

Ms. Westbrook said that Sprint Nextel had not decided whether to ask the incumbents to take part in the review, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of March. The goal is to use a single creative agency, she added, just as last March the company consolidated its media account, once divided between MindShare and Starcom, at MindShare.  TBWA/Chiat/Day is part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group. Riney is part of the Publicis Groupe, as is Starcom; MindShare is part of the WPP Group.  ADDENDA  ",

            "text": "  Getting Graphic With Vista  Q. When shopping for a new computer, what kind of graphics card will be necessary to run Microsoft's Windows Vista?  A. The Windows Vista operating system, due at the end of the month for consumers, will be available in several versions with a range of system requirements, so your graphics-card needs will vary. Most hardware makers are labeling new computers as either Vista Capable to run the basic version, or Vista Premium Ready for a PC that can handle more Vista features.  To run the low-end Vista Home Basic version of the system, Microsoft states that a compatible PC needs to have at least an 800-megahertz processor, 512 megabytes of system memory and a graphics processor that can run the DirectX 9 multimedia software and has at least 32 megabytes of graphics memory.  While these hardware requirements are designed for the simplest version of Vista, they are not enough to display Windows Aero, its sophisticated graphical interface. Windows Aero -- which works with the Vista Home Premium, Vista Business, Vista Enterprise and Vista Ultimate editions of the system -- features shimmering effects like translucent windows and 3-D graphics.  According to Microsoft, a Windows Aero-compatible graphics card must be able to handle DirectX 9, Pixel Shader 2.0 technology and support 32 bits per pixel for color depth. The card needs at least 128 megabytes of graphics memory (although 256 megabytes of dedicated graphics memory is often recommended) and be able to run the Windows Display Driver Model software. Also known as W.D.D.M., that is the code that lets Vista and the graphics card communicate properly.  The Windows Vista home page of Microsoft's site has the full system requirements at www.microsoft.com/windowsvista.  Many PC makers now have areas of their Web sites devoted to Vista systems and information (www.dell.com/vista, for example) and may be helpful for research. For those looking to upgrade existing computers, graphics-card manufacturers like Nvidia (www.nvidia.com) and ATI (ati.amd.com) detail their product specifications on their Web sites and tell which cards work best with Microsoft's new system.  Voice Quality On the Internet  Q. Is there a way to make VoIP phone calls sound smoother, with fewer gaps in the audio?  A. Voice-over-Internet protocol, or VoIP, is technology that converts a phone conversation into data that can travel over a computer network -- and uses the Internet's cables instead of the telephone company's wires to carry the chat.  VoIP can be used for free computer-to-computer audio calls with software like Skype (www.skype.com). Many companies also offer residential and business VoIP phone plans that work pretty much like standard telephone service except for the use of Internet networking to carry the calls.  One factor that can affect call quality is network traffic. If your home or office network is being used to upload, download or stream a lot of data while you are trying to talk over your VoIP connection, the audio quality of the call may suffer from the lack of available bandwidth. Most VoIP services require a broadband Internet connection.  Call fidelity may vary by VoIP provider, and several consumer-oriented product sites and magazines have compared the different services for value and call quality. Consumer Reports has tested VoIP service, and sites like ConsumerSearch (www.consumersearch.com) have also done VoIP roundups.  New Background For a Mac Desktop  Q. How do I make my Mac automatically change its desktop background?  A. In recent versions of Mac OS X, you can set the computer to change its desktop background image at specified intervals in the System Preferences area. To get there, go to the Apple menu to System Preferences. Click on the Desktop & Screen Saver icon and click the Desktop tab.  In the dialog box, you can select a folder of photos or iPhoto album to use as background images. Put a check in the box next to ''Change picture'' and use the drop-down menu to select the length of time to display each image.  J. D. BIERSDORFER  Q & A  ",

The 5-ounce phone, which uses Cingular's cellular and wireless broadband networks in the United States, can connect in most countries that use the G.S.M. standard.  The phone, which comes in a dark blue rubberized finish with chrome accents, has a full keyboard, bright color touch screen and 1.3-megapixel camera. But road warriors will appreciate its more business-oriented features, like a dedicated mute switch on the top, a MiniSD card slot for memory expansion and a speakerphone for meetings on the go.  The 750 supports Bluetooth wireless networking and four international G.S.M. bands. It can jump onto Cingular's fast wireless data network for video, audio and document downloads, and can connect to most e-mail providers using Microsoft Outlook Mobile and Microsoft's push e-mail systems.  Windows users can synchronize their contacts and calendar entries with home PCs using the included software, and the phone can open and edit most Microsoft Office documents.

            "text": "  IF you have an ordinary cellphone -- the type that you got free, or cheaply, when you signed up for service -- you might envy those with phones that are also personal digital assistants, like BlackBerrys, Treos, Sidekicks and Windows smartphones.  Those devices, typically costing $200 to $400, let you do more than just make phone calls and take pictures. They are pocket-size computers equipped for many functions, including e-mail, Web browsing and contact management, note taking, financial recordkeeping and a calendar.  But as it turns out, that humble cellphone in your pocket may be able to do all this and more, depending on its built-in features and the available add-on software.  The screen may be a bit smaller than on a palmtop, and you will lack an alphanumeric keyboard, making typing a lot harder -- but as anyone who has sent text messages or entered names into their phone's address book knows, you can peck out letters using the numeric keypad.  Cellphone manufacturers, carriers and independent application providers are now offering lots of programs and services that can be used on a wide number of phones. Not all services work on all phones. Some are carrier-specific, and some work only on certain phones.  Many require that the phone be able to handle programs written in Java (most new ones are). Some services are free; others charge a monthly fee.  There are a variety of ways to get these applications, and you probably already have some. In addition to Bluetooth and a camera, the Nokia 6102i, effectively free after a rebate from Cingular Wireless, comes with software applications including an audio recorder, an alarm clock, a calendar, a to-do list, a note taker, a calculator, a countdown timer and a stopwatch. It also has AOL, Yahoo, ICQ and MSN instant messengers, a text messaging program, an FM radio, e-mail and, of course, an Internet browser.  And all of this is before you download any applications over the wireless network from the Cingular Mall, where you can buy games, ring tones, graphics and other applications.  Sprint's Samsung M500, available for as little as $9.99 after rebate, has a comparable list of built-in features, along with a dictionary and the ability to store files and play music. Like more expensive hand-helds, it comes with a U.S.B. cable to sync with a PC and a 64-megabyte microSD card (for about $30 you can buy a one-gigabyte card) to store MP3 files that you can play on the phone.  It can even display an analog clock, but the real power of this and many other phones is the applications you can buy and download.  Some of the productivity programs that can be downloaded from Sprint are RandMcNally StreetFinder, MapQuest Mobile, Vindigo City Guide, Zagat restaurant guide and FlyteSource Mobile, which gives real-time flight status. These or similar services are also available on phones from other carriers.  All cellular carriers offer some type of e-mail service, sometimes for an extra fee. But consumers have choices. In addition to the carrier's services, there are free third-party services you can use, including Yahoo Mail, Gmail and Flurry.  Before using any of these services or downloading any applications, check to see what, if anything, it will cost. Even if the application is free, there may be data or air-time charges from your carrier, and there may be plans that can reduce those charges.  Flurry, a free service that works with several carriers, is both an e-mail application and an R.S.S. (for Really Simple Syndication) news reader, which you can use to subscribe to frequently updated content. You start by visiting www.flurry.com from your PC and entering your cellphone number, carrier name, e-mail address and password, and any R.S.S. feeds you wish to subscribe to. The service then sends a text message to your phone with a link for downloading the program.  The service works with most publicly available e-mail accounts, the company's chief executive, Sean Byrnes, said. It can also import up to 430 contacts from Outlook, Gmail and any other program or service that can export standard comma separated values, or CSV, files. You can also dial a phone number from that contact list.  Google recently started offering a free cellphone version of its popular Gmail service. If you have signed up for a Gmail account, you can download the application by pointing your cellphone browser to gmail.com/app. You enter your Gmail user name and password, and a few minutes later you are reading your mail. You can also compose and respond to mail and bring up your Gmail contact list.  Yahoo is conducting a public beta test of its free Go 2.0 service, which has numerous applications, including a phone-centric Internet search tool. You tell it where you are (a satellite-based locator will be available later) and it can find nearby restaurants, movie show times, stores and services and display a map to your destination. Because it is a downloaded application (at mobile.yahoo.com), it is faster than using a Web page, but it can also link you to Web pages through your phone's browser.  Yahoo Go also gives you access to Yahoo e-mail synchronized with your Web account. Mail is searchable, and you can display JPEG graphic files. You can track your stock portfolio, follow sports teams and get weather reports. You can also connect to a Flickr photo account to see or share photos from the road. Yahoo Go works with a limited number of phones from Cingular, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, Alltel, Telus and Rogers.  You're not going to find Microsoft Outlook on a run-of-the-mill cellphone. But with SoonR, a free application (at www.soonr.com) that runs in your cellphone's browser, you can use your phone to gain access to data from Outlook and other programs running on a PC or Mac.  You can view thumbnails of Word and Excel files, and Windows users can read, respond, compose and send Outlook e-mail. You can make calls from your Outlook contact list and consult and update Outlook's calendar. The files and programs are not on the phone -- you are using the phone for remote access to your home or office computer, and any changes you make on the phone show up on the PC.  You can remotely use most popular PC and Mac desktop search programs and forward files through your computer's broadband connection. You can even run the Internet phone service Skype on your PC from your cellphone.  Many of today's phones make use of the satellite-based Global Positioning System, mainly to help responders find you in an emergency, but the technology can also be tapped for location-based services, like turning your phone into a portable navigation device with turn-by-turn maps and audible directions through the phone's speaker.  I test-drove both the TeleNav service, which works with select phones from most carriers, and Verizon's VZ Navigator. Both are $10 a month. VZ Navigator can also be bought for $2.99 a day. Both use the phone network to provide directions, maps and points of interest that are updated on an ongoing basis. They have a ''points of interest'' database with millions of listings. TeleNav also has a ''gas by price'' feature that taps into an online database of gas station prices to lead you to the cheapest gas in your area.  So instead of lusting over that palmtop or Apple's highly anticipated iPhone, reach into your pocket and see what that phone of yours has to offer. You might just be carrying around a poor man's BlackBerry -- minus the keyboard.  BASICS  ",

            "text": "  Samsung, the world's largest seller of televisions, will introduce at next week's Consumer Electronics Show a new line of rear-projection L.C.D. televisions that will not be much thicker than flat-panel TVs but will cost about 30 percent less.  The new sets, aimed at those who want a bigger set but cannot afford a plasma TV, will come in 50- to 60-inch sizes. At 10 inches deep, they can be hung on a wall.  While consumers are embracing L.C.D. flat-panel TVs in ever-larger sizes, Samsung has also recommitted itself to plasma TV and will double its current plasma production capacity later this year, said G. S. Choi, the company's president for digital media, in an interview from South Korea.  Plasma will continue to dominate in larger sizes, and the company will add an 80-inch model to its lineup this year, Mr. Choi said. To help consumers fit these larger sizes in their homes, Samsung said it was redesigning the TV frames to make them up to 30 percent thinner.  At the electronics show, held annually in Las Vegas, Samsung will also introduce a wireless plasma TV that will be able to receive HDTV programming sent from an HD-DVD or Blu-ray player or set-top box. Because there will be no cables to hide, consumers may be more likely to hang such a plasma display on a wall.  The company, which was the first to introduce a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player last year, will announce its second-generation player next week. The new model is expected to cost about 20 percent less than the current version, but will have more interactive functions.  Although LG will introduce a dual format HD-DVD/Blu-ray player, Samsung has no plans to do the same. ''If the market is still divided, we could do a dual-format player, but we will wait and see,'' Mr. Choi said.  Correction:  January 5, 2007, Friday  An article and a headline in some copies of Business Day yesterday about plans by Samsung to introduce new rear-projection televisions next week at the Consumer Electronics Show misstated the technology the TVs will employ. They will use digital light processing, or D.L.P. technology -- not liquid crystal display or L.C.D. technology.  ",

The SPH200D connects to your standard phone line and allows traditional calls. It also hooks into your Internet router and works with Skype, the popular online calling service owned by eBay that allows free calls to other Skype users, who typically talk using headsets at their computers. You can talk to anyone on your Skype buddy list or make inexpensive national and international calls over Skype's network without having to use your own computer.  The phone includes a cordless handset that uses D.E.C.T. (digital enhanced cordless telecommunications) technology to reduce interference from other wireless networks and improve call quality. It also has a small color screen that shows a list of Skype contacts or caller ID information, depending on the network being used.  The phone is priced at $199 and is available now at major online and retail stores. Additional handsets are extra and will be available later this year.  JOHN BIGGS  CIRCUITS  ",

            "text": "  Adam Gillitt does not hate what is on his TV as much as he dislikes what is attached to it.  Mr. Gillitt, a graphic designer from Alameda, Calif., is exasperated by his high-definition cable box, made by the technology giant Motorola and leased to him by his local cable provider, Comcast. The $10-a-month device, he says, has a poorly designed electronic program guide and responds slowly, or not at all, to commands from the remote control.  ''Paying for something this awful hurts,'' Mr. Gillitt said.  For many Americans, the cable box -- still commonly called the set-top box, though it is now too big to balance on top of increasingly thin TVs -- may be the most disappointing piece of technology in their homes. As inventions like TiVo and YouTube alter the way people watch and control video, the traditional box has largely failed to keep up.  Now that is beginning to change.  At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, makers of set-top boxes exhibited devices with a host of new features: more hard-disk space for storing digitally recorded TV shows, easier-to-navigate program guides, connections to Web sites, DVD burners and video games.  The box manufacturers and the cable operators like Comcast, Cox and Time Warner Cable that they sell to, have an age-old motivation for improving their products: fear. New competitors are flooding into the TV business, including the industry's rivals in the telephone business, and the computer kingpins Microsoft and Apple.  Consumers can buy those alternatives at regular retail outlets, including the newest high-definition version of TiVo. It sells for $800 (with a $20 monthly fee) and can replace the box that cable and satellite providers lease to customers, instead of merely sitting on top of it and adding to living room clutter.  Cable operators are being forced to play nice with these new entrants. The Federal Communications Commission has set a deadline of July 1 for all cable operators to make their services work with boxes from all third-party manufacturers, and last week it rejected a request from Comcast to extend the deadline.  ''Set-top boxes are becoming the central piece of equipment in the home for accessing entertainment and information,'' said Joshua Goldman, chief executive of Akimbo, a Silicon Valley start-up trying to bring programming to the TV over the Internet. ''Consumers will buy their own device if they feel like they are not getting the services they want from their television operators.''  For decades, the cable industry did not worry much about introducing new features into their typically black set-top boxes. They faced little competition in their local markets and bought their equipment from one of two companies: General Instruments, which was purchased by Motorola in 2000, and Scientific Atlanta, acquired by Cisco Systems in 2005.  Both companies build TV boxes according to the specifications of cable companies, who lease them to customers and then make their money on monthly subscriptions. Because they are essentially giving the boxes away, the industry's focus, not surprisingly, is on keeping the cost of the equipment low.  But now new players are offering more sophisticated alternatives to cable boxes. Over the last two years, 30 million personal computers have been sold with Media Center software from Microsoft, which enhances video viewing on the PC, making it more like a television. The computers come with a remote control and can pause and fast-forward through video.  Many of those PCs can now replace set-top boxes, thanks to a federal law passed over a decade ago that requires cable operators to sell credit-card-size devices called CableCards. These cards can plug into a Media Center PC, or other consumer electronics appliances like DVD players, allowing them to receive regular cable channels.  Last week, Apple also joined the fray with Apple TV, a slick silver box that connects to the television and displays programs and movies that have been downloaded from iTunes. It goes on sale next month for $299.  The message to cable companies and their equipment vendors is clear: if they want to keep up, they must build a better cable box.  They appear to be listening. At the Las Vegas show, just as many visitors swarmed around Motorola's new set-top boxes as its latest mobile phones. The company showed a line of new boxes compatible with high-definition TV, with one-third more hard-disk space than its previous models, like the clumsy device Mr. Gillitt has under his TV.  The new boxes are designed to offer greater control over the television. For example, one new feature Motorola is promoting is called ''program restart.'' If cable customers miss a show by a few minutes and do not record it, they can click a button and get the cable company to retransmit it directly to them, instantly. Time Warner Cable is currently testing the service in San Antonio.  Padmasree Warrior, the chief technology officer of Motorola, said consumers now demand more from their televisions, largely thanks to TiVo, which has forced the cable companies to ask suppliers for more innovative set-top boxes. ''Enough people are experienced with time-shifting that there's a demand that the industry dynamics change,'' Ms. Warrior said.  Across the showroom floor, Scientific Atlanta executives agreed that the old featureless TV tuner was quickly becoming a relic. Among its new boxes, the company showed off one called the MCP-100: a silver set-top box with a digital video recorder and one surprising new feature: a slot for DVDs. In addition to getting live TV, the device can play movies and burn programs and movies onto discs. It is now being tested by cable companies.  Scientific Atlanta is also building Internet connections into all its boxes, so consumers can get programming from the Web in addition to the traditional ways, by cable or satellite.  ''There's a growing need for high-quality video that goes right to where it's supposed to, the television, and not to the PC, where only college kids are looking at it,'' said Robert C. McIntryre, Scientific Atlanta's chief technology officer.  The cable companies and their equipment vendors must adapt to the Internet age quickly, because soon customers will have more choices than ever. Telephone companies like AT&T and Verizon are investing heavily to bury fiber optic cables in most major cities and roll out their own TV offerings.  Because the telephone companies deliver television using Internet standards and typically package it with telephone and Internet service, they say they can offer consumers more choices and control over the viewing experience. AT&T, for example, showed off a set-top box at the Las Vegas show that received four different streams of programming (compared with most new digital cable boxes, which receive only two). That allows a customer to watch a program live while simultaneously recording three others.  One new feature that AT&T was showing, called picture-in-picture browsing, or PIP, lets a TV viewer channel surf on a small screen while continuing to watch another program on the rest of the screen.  AT&T hopes to have its TV service, called uVerse, accessible to 19 million homes by the end of next year. If it can pull it off, it would position AT&T as a serious rival to cable and satellite television providers.  All of these established companies also have to watch out for smaller rivals with their own set-top box innovations. TiVo's Series3 HD Digital Media Recorder, which went on sale last fall at electronics stores like Best Buy, is CableCard-ready, which means buyers can plug in a card from their local cable operator and use it as a substitute for a cable box.  Another technology start-up at the show, Digeo, exhibited its new Moxi service, a set-top box with digital video recorder that it plans to start selling in the latter half of this year. The Moxi also works with a CableCard and comes with smaller optional ''Moxi mates,'' which buyers can connect to the other TVs in their homes. Those televisions will then have access to the programming received by and recorded on the primary set-top box.  Digeo's chief executive, Mike Fidler, said increased competition was ushering in a renaissance in set-top-box design. ''Companies can now come in with innovative products that change the consumer experience and bring a whole new level of enjoyment to television,'' Mr. Fidler said.  ",

            "text": "  Importing Contacts From Eudora  Q. Is there a way to transfer a large address book from Eudora to another e-mail program?  A. Relocating your Eudora e-mail address book is possible in most situations. The exact steps will vary based on the version of Eudora you have, the operating system you have and the new e-mail program you want to use.  In many cases, you can simply use an importing tool from your new e-mail software to pull in the address book from your Eudora program. Microsoft Outlook Express and Mozilla Thunderbird are two programs with such an option.  Some versions of Eudora use a full-feature address book that can hold more information than just a name and an e-mail address, offering fields for notes, photos and multiple mailing addresses as well. If your Eudora address book is fairly detailed, you may want to consider getting conversion software that can move all of this information more accurately between mail programs.  Address Magic by Connected Software (www.connectedsw.com/AddressMagic.php) is one such utility for Windows. The eMailman Web site, which devotes itself to all things e-mail, has a page of links to other address-book conversion programs for Mac and Windows systems at www.emailman.com/conversion.  Untangling A Mess of Cables  Q. What can I do about the tangle of computer cables on and behind the desk?  A. If you find your desk area has become knotted with snaking cables, there are a couple of approaches to untangling the problem.  One way to cut down on cables is to use wireless peripherals. For example, many mice, keyboards, speakers and other computer hardware items now come in Bluetooth versions that use radio signals to transmit data between devices instead of a cable. This option, however, can be expensive, and you may not be able to find wireless products for all of your hardware needs.  A cable-management system is a cheaper option. Companies like Cable-Safe (www.cable-safe.com) offer several products for tying down (or tying up) the power cords and wires coming out of the computer.  Office supply stores like Staples (www.staples.com) and Office Depot (www.officedepot.com) also sell a variety of inexpensive cable ties, clips and sleeves to keep cords neatly bound and under control. Threading your cables through plastic tubing (like the kind sold for aquariums) is another option, and is sometimes favored by those with pets who like to nibble on computer cables.  Adding Titles To Songs in iTunes  Q. Sometimes when I try to import music from a CD into iTunes, the computer lists the songs as ''Track 01, Track 02,'' etc. Is there any way I can manually add the information for each song?  A. The iTunes program pulls down album information over the Internet from the Gracenote CD Database (also known as the CDDB). If you are not online when you import the songs from the CD, iTunes cannot download the titles. You may also see the ''Track 01'' listing if you are connected to the Internet but there is no information about that particular album in the database.  If you imported the tracks when you were offline, you can go back and look for the song information the next time you fire up your Internet connection. Once you are online, go to iTunes and click on the nameless tracks you want to identify.  On the Windows version of the program, holding down the Shift key lets you select multiple tracks listed next to each other, and holding down the Control key while you click lets you select nonadjacent songs in a list. (On the Mac, the Shift and Command keys provide the same functions.)  Once you have selected your tracks, go to the Advanced menu and select ''Get CD Track Names.'' If iTunes can find the album, it should apply the song information to your selected tracks.  If all else fails, you can manually type in the information for each song. One way to do this is to select the song or album you want to change and choose Get Info from the File menu. Click the Info tab and make your changes. If you are editing a whole album's worth of tracks, click the next button to go to the next track and click the O.K. button when finished.  J. D. BIERSDORFER  Q & A  ",

            "text": "  Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, is using the Consumer Electronics Show here to highlight several new consumer-oriented products and to unveil a partnership with the Ford Motor Company to build Microsoft technology into several Ford models.  The show, the largest trade event in North America, has become an annual forum for Mr. Gates to mix product announcements with computer-filled visions of future Microsoft-based technologies.  In remarks prepared for delivery on Sunday night, the eve of the show, he sought to differentiate Microsoft from other companies by showing how its software products tie together a range of consumer activities including games, interactive television, communications and music. A Microsoft executive briefed reporters on the presentation on Friday.  Among the announcements was the introduction of a hardware upgrade to the Xbox 360 video-game system that will permit the system to deliver the Microsoft interactive television service being offered by partners, including AT&T. The system will duplicate many capabilities of the Media Center version of the Windows operating system, like the ability to record and play back digital video.  Microsoft and Ford are to offer a system called Sync, a voice-activated method for connecting cellphones and media players -- like Microsoft's Zune -- to a vehicle. Similar systems are widely available in Japanese and German automobiles. Sync, the first major commercial introduction of the Microsoft Auto software, offers hands-free phone dialing and can read incoming text messages through the car's audio system.  Microsoft is also introducing a consumer software product called Windows Home Server that will be marketed with several partners, including Hewlett-Packard. It will be an appliancelike device that will connect to a home network and perform functions like network-based backup and media and file-sharing as well as functioning as a Web server. The price will be between $400 and $500, according to Microsoft executives. The product will be based on Windows Server 2003, and not the company's newer Windows Vista operating system.  On the program with Mr. Gates was Robbie Bach, the executive in charge of the company's consumer products, to demonstrate game play involving a PC user running Windows Vista competing against a home user playing the game on an Xbox 360. There is no public timetable for such a capability, a company executive said, adding that the feature would not be available for all of the Xbox 360 games.  Another scheduled demonstration involved the current version of the Home of the Future, an installation at Microsoft headquarters with prototypes of home-oriented technologies. Applications chosen for the spotlight were radio-frequency ID tags and displays for the walls of children's bedrooms using organic light-emitting diodes.  ",

            "text": "  More than four times as many households downloaded videos from file-sharing networks as they did from centralized services like iTunes in the third quarter of 2006.  Downloads from file-sharing networks are generally free, and have long occurred outside the control of copyright holders. The cost of for-pay downloads, about 90 percent of which go through iTunes, generally includes a licensing fee.  But not many of the freeloaders are actually downloading mainstream content, according to the new data on downloading, which was gathered by the NPD Group, a consumer-research firm, through tracking software installed in 12,500 households. Only about 20 percent of the videos downloaded from file-sharing networks were TV shows, and 5 percent were mainstream movies, while just under 60 percent were pornographic movies.  The relative scarcity of pirated movie downloads may have more to do with legal and business pressure than with users' tastes. Many file-sharing networks are struggling to find accommodation with the movie and recording industries; for example, BitTorrent, a service whose software is on about 80 million computers, struck a deal in 2005 with the Motion Picture Association of America to remove infringing content from the search index on its Web site.

            "text": "  Botnet programs and other malicious software largely take aim at PCs running the Microsoft Windows operating system, because Windows' ubiquity makes it fertile ground for network-based attacks.  Using a non-Windows-based PC may be one defense against these programs, known as malware; also, anti-malware programs and antivirus utilities for the PC are available from several vendors. Windows users should use the Windows update feature.  Microsoft itself entered the computer-security business last year and now offers a free malware-removal tool for download from its Web site. The company says the program removes about two million pieces of malware each month, of which 200,000, or about 10 percent, are botnet infections.  Like Windows, Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is also a large, convenient target for code-writing vandals. Alternative browsers, like Firefox and Opera, may insulate users. Microsoft's most recent browser release, Internet Explorer 7, is said to offer significantly improved defenses.  Adding software to your browser like Noscript, a plug-in utility, can limit the ability of remote programs to run potentially damaging programs on your PC.  Security experts also offer these tips:  Don't share your computer (on which you pay your bills) with your children (who download games).  Use a firewall program that warns you about outgoing connections that botnets make to communicate with control software.  Don't use the same password on more than one financial site.  Don't let your browser store your password for such sites.  Don't buy anything offered by a spammer.  Don't click if someone offers you something too good to be true. It is.  JOHN MARKOFF  ",

The Interlink ExpressCard Media Remote lets an average laptop act like a media center, complete with a couch-potato-worthy remote control.  The Media Remote is just four millimeters thick and fits into an ExpressCard slot, found on most recent laptops. When it is in the slot, the remote charges itself using the laptop's battery, and when it is out it communicates with the laptop using Bluetooth wireless technology. It should last about a week on a full charge.  The remote works with iTunes, Windows Media Center, Windows Media Player and RealPlayer and can switch tracks, pause and play audio and video and select on-screen items, all from up to 30 feet away. The device also works with PowerPoint, allowing it to double as a presentation remote.  The one-ounce remote costs $49.95 and is available online and in retail stores.  Fans of digital media will appreciate its small size and ease of storage. The only things missing are a few good DVDs and a library of easy-listening music.  JOHN BIGGS  CIRCUITS  ",

            "text": "  After falling behind Google in Internet search and advertising, Yahoo is trying to remain No. 1 in the battle to deliver information and online services to mobile phones.  Yahoo's latest weapon is software that will let users find information like weather, news, stock quotes and sports scores more quickly on their cellphones. The software, called Go for Mobile 2.0, was unveiled Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, just as Google announced a partnership to put its own mobile software on Samsung cellphones.  Internet services on mobile phones remain a tiny market today, especially in the United States. But industry analysts and Internet companies believe they will eventually outgrow the market for computer-based Internet services as the capabilities of cellphones and the bandwidth of wireless networks improve rapidly.  ''We view the mobile Internet today as entering an era where the PC-based Internet was in '96 or '97,'' said Steve Boom, Yahoo's senior vice president for broadband and mobile. ''It is just on the cusp of taking off.''  For Yahoo, securing a leading position in that market is especially important. The company has struggled over the last year, as Google solidified its lead in search and leaped ahead in online video by acquiring YouTube. Yahoo has also been criticized as lacking initiative and being slow to capitalize on Internet trends like social networking, now dominated by MySpace and Facebook.  Yahoo's introduction of mobile software was reported Monday in The Wall Street Journal. The software, a revamped version of technology that the company introduced last year, makes it easy to move among various online services providing news, sports scores, maps, weather, movies, photos and e-mail. The free ad-supported services will be tailored to match a user's settings, like ZIP code and stock preferences, on Yahoo's existing online services.  The software will also be equipped with a search service, oneSearch, that will interpret a user's intent and deliver results accordingly. For instance, when a user searches for a sports team, the service will make a bet that the user is interested in the latest scores, a team profile and news related to the team, and return those first. More general Web links, like those returned in typical Internet searches, will be de-emphasized.  ''It's the kind of thing that Yahoo very much needs to extend further onto the mobile platform,'' said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm based in Bethesda, Md.  The service is already available on about 70 handset models and is expected to be on some 400 devices by the end of the year, Mr. Boom said. Yahoo has signed agreements with handset makers to preload or distribute the software. Yahoo is also encouraging users to download the software directly onto their devices.  Yahoo's mobile services were used by 6.8 percent of cellphone users in the United States in October, according to Telephia, a research firm. That made Yahoo, whose most popular wireless service is e-mail, the No. 1 mobile Internet company. But in mobile search, Google already tops Yahoo, according to Telephia.  Google said its cellphone search, e-mail and map products would be preloaded on Samsung phones. Deep Nishar, Google's director of wireless products and strategy, said the company's mobile search service already emphasized results that users typically want, like sports scores and movie times and locations.  To succeed, both companies will need to secure cooperation from wireless carriers, which could prove a challenge for some time as several offer competing services, said Julie Ask, an analyst at Jupiter Research.  Yahoo said some overseas carriers had agreed to support its services. Mr. Boom said it was ''a matter of time'' before American carriers followed suit. As an incentive, Yahoo is offering to share revenue from any advertising on the system, he said.  Ms. Ask noted that, for now, most cellphone advertising consists of text messages sent directly to users, and that ad revenues from mobile search and Web browsing are minuscule.  ",

            "text": "  FOR years, Internet users have treated online photo services like a batch of holiday snapshots -- checking them out for a while, then letting them collect dust on the shelf as soon as something new comes along.  Now Smilebox.com, a start-up based in Redmond, Wash., is offering customers the opportunity to build online scrapbooks with animation, music and artwork. The kicker is that, in a market cluttered with free services that have struggled to produce profits, Smilebox is actually attracting paying customers.  Smilebox.com users pay $1 or $2 to choose from among 350 graphic templates for their digital photos, or pay for a $5 monthly subscription for unlimited access to the templates.  Those with dozens of holiday photos might choose to collect them in a virtual photo album with holiday themed artwork on the borders, for instance. Next, users can choose from among 700 musical selections to accompany the photo book, and decide on other visual flourishes, like animated transitions between pages. (Smilebox also offers a free version that includes advertisements and fewer music and template choices.)  Unlike many other photo-sharing services, Smilebox does not require users to upload photos to the Web site and edit them there. Rather, since users download the template, they need only drag images to the desired locations on the template, then upload the entire file to the Web site. Smilebox then delivers e-mail messages to the user's friends and family, inviting them to view the book.  Should Smilebox gain enough acceptance with consumers before the free photo services offer up competing features, analysts said, it may well build a successful business. Building a successful business of any significant size, though, may be asking too much.  ''This looks to me like a niche business,'' said Christopher Chute, an analyst with IDC, a technology consultancy. ''Getting people to pay has always been a problem, so they've got to find a hook.''  Andrew Wright, the chief executive of Smilebox, believes he has found at least one hook into a bigger market, thanks to an alliance with Hallmark. In that partnership, the greeting card company in December started offering a modified version of Smilebox on Hallmark.com.  According to Steven Ruschill, who oversees online initiatives for Hallmark's new business development group, the Smilebox partnership has yielded ''pleasantly surprising'' results, despite his company's having done nothing to promote the service. ''It's a little too early to judge it fully, but so far so good,'' he said.  Hallmark.com visitors who clicked on the Smilebox feature turned into paying customers more often than Mr. Ruschill anticipated, he said. If the number of paying customers reaches an undisclosed threshold over the next several months, he said, Hallmark will most likely retain the service on its site and continue to share the revenues with Smilebox.  ''When the novelty starts to wear off, the question is whether users will just think of this as another thing they have to do,'' he said.  Mr. Wright said that Smilebox.com's traffic climbed steadily after the company introduced it in April, reaching about 500,000 visitors in December. He would not say how many of those visitors were paying customers, but he said, ''the business model is working very well.''  In addition to revenues from subscriptions and one-time sales, Smilebox is also distributing Google ads alongside its free photo templates, netting the company about $7 for each 1,000 people who view a page of pictures.  Mr. Wright is, however, more focused on the fee-based service, having already built a successful subscription offering in the online games category which, like online photos, is dominated by free services. Mr. Wright formerly led RealNetworks' RealArcade, and several former RealNetworks executives, among others, have backed his business with $6 million in venture financing to date.  Mr. Wright's fee-based approach is unusual, but not unique. Smugmug, a photo-sharing service based in San Francisco, charges $40 to $150 annually for digital photo storage and sharing. Chris MacAskill, Smugmug's president, said the company is profitable, with slightly more than $10 million in annual sales, and spends nothing on marketing. He said Smilebox ''looks very interesting.''  ''I've seen quite a few attempts at it in the past,'' Mr. MacAskill said, referring to digital scrapbooking, ''including a very impressive Sony site, Screenblast, that for some reason never got traction and went away. Surely someone will make it work, and these guys look like they've got a lot of talent.''  The darling of free online photo-sharing, Photobucket.com, will introduce both free and paid services that will compete with Smilebox early in 2007, said Alex Welch, the company's chief executive. Mr. Welch said that service would let users create custom slideshows with audio.  ''There's definitely a huge hunger for online editing tools,'' Mr. Welch said. ''The question is whether you can charge for it and differentiate yourself enough to make a business out of it.''  Photobucket.com raced to the top of online photo-sharing sites in 2006, reaching 15.6 million visitors in November, according to ComScore Media Metrix, an online measurement company. A year earlier the company attracted 10 million fewer visitors, but word quickly spread among MySpace users, among others, that Photobucket simplified the process of posting photos on that Web site and others, and an Internet star was born.  Now Mr. Welch said that even as it develops new features to keep pace with Smilebox and others, it is working harder to generate advertising revenue from visitors. The business recently created its own advertising sales team to strike deals with big brand marketers and advertising agencies. Until now, the company has distributed ads on behalf of Google and other networks, an effort that Mr. Welch said ''has worked well.''  If Photobucket, Smilebox and similar services generate significant profits from ads or user fees, IDC's Mr. Chute, for one, will be surprised. ''The lack of a clear revenue model has always been the bane of these sites,'' Mr. Chute said. ''The only way these guys have ever made money was to be acquired.''  E-COMMERCE REPORT  ",

            "text": "  Yahoo said Tuesday that it planned to build individual Web sites around 100 entertainment ''brands'' this year that would pull together content from Yahoo's sprawling array of online properties.  The effort, called Brand Universe, is intended to create online destinations that will draw large audiences around individual movies, television shows, bands, celebrities, games and other types of entertainment.  Vince Broady, head of games, entertainment and youth at Yahoo, said the company had a wealth of entertainment content, but finding the material about a specific attraction was not always intuitive.  ''We don't connect the dots for our users around those brands,'' Mr. Broady said. ''Brand Universe is designed to fix that problem. What we are really trying to do is create environments where fans of brands can hang out when they are online.''  The sites would also create windows where visitors could find out more about specific attractions and perhaps become fans, Mr. Broady said.  Yahoo has already built a Brand Universe site around the Nintendo Wii, and on Tuesday it announced six more, which will be centered on Harry Potter; the video games Halo and the Sims; the television shows ''The Office'' and ''Lost''; and Transformers, the toy line, television show, comic books and coming movie.  Other topics will be announced in the next few weeks, and all 100 sites will be introduced this year, Mr. Broady said.  The Wii site, which is at wii.yahoo.com, includes a buyer's guide, video, content from message boards and Yahoo Answers, photos from Yahoo's Flickr site and links to other Wii Web sites from the bookmarks service Del.icio.us.  Like much of Yahoo, the Brand Universe sites will be supported by advertising, and Yahoo said it would discuss various ways to share revenue with the brand owners.  Mr. Broady acknowledged that there could be tensions with some content owners who were trying to create online destinations of their own. The company said it did not plan to ask permission from the owners before creating the sites, but would not proceed if the owners objected.  But Mr. Broady said he expected that most would jump at the opportunity to have their online and offline activities promoted to Yahoo's large Internet audience.  ''Among all the entertainment categories, hopefully, we have found 100 willing partners, but if not, we'll move on to other brands,'' he said.  Mr. Broady said Yahoo would be able to track the appeal of individual brands across the Yahoo network and share that information with their owners.  The Brand Universe announcement was part of a briefing Yahoo executives gave to reporters on the company's media group, based in Santa Monica, Calif., which has been criticized for lack of clear focus. Lloyd Braun, the former ABC executive who ran the media group, left in December during a companywide revamping.  Company executives said traffic was up strongly across a broad range of Yahoo media properties, including news, videos, music, movies and games.  ",

            "text": "  Microsoft's power in the technology industry, some analysts insist, is waning. It faces a host of rivals from a reinvigorated Apple on the desktop to Web-based challengers like Google, delivering services and software online.  But yesterday, on the eve of the arrival of new models of Microsoft's flagship products, the Windows operating system and the Office programs, the skeptics were overshadowed and drowned out by the opening salvos in the software giant's marketing campaign.  Windows Vista and Office 2007 start appearing today, available in retail stores as a shrink-wrapped package and shipped on new machines sold by personal computer makers. The new Microsoft offerings were available to large corporate customers at the end of November.  Steven A. Ballmer, the company's chief executive, called today ''the biggest product launch in Microsoft's history,'' and the rollout will be backed by a first-year marketing budget of hundreds of millions of dollars.  New versions of Windows and Office move across the technology industry like a powerful weather system, driving sales of personal computers and other hardware, software and services. The pace is typically gradual but steady, yet the impact on the rest of the industry is significant.  Over 5,000 software and hardware products are ready to run on Vista, and Microsoft has more than 500,000 industry partners worldwide, including resellers, retailers and consultants as well as hardware and software companies. Millions of developers write programs that run on Windows.  For every dollar Microsoft makes on Windows Vista, the rest of the industry will collect $18 of revenue, estimates IDC, a technology research firm. Indeed, those that build products and services on top of and around Microsoft's technology constitute an industry ecosystem that business professors have studied. And Microsoft's long investment in nurturing that network of mutual support, they say, is a major reason that Windows holds more than 90 percent of the market for PC operating systems.  In the United States, the IDC report concluded, ''this ecosystem should sell about $70 billion in products and services revolving around Windows Vista'' in 2007. The introduction of Windows Vista, IDC projected, is expected to generate 157,000 jobs in the United States. The IDC study was paid for by Microsoft, but the research firm said it used its own methodology.  Because the universe of Windows users has grown, Mr. Ballmer predicted that sales of Windows Vista in the first three months would be five times the early sales of Windows 95, introduced in 1995, and double the sales of Windows XP, shipped in 2001.  Mr. Ballmer spoke at a news conference in New York, along with executives from large computer manufacturers and chip makers. ''I hope your forecasts are right,'' said Todd Bradley, executive vice president for personal computers at Hewlett-Packard. ''We'd all be thrilled.''  The industry has certainly been patient. Vista suffered repeated delays, coming five years after Windows XP. Microsoft has vowed that there will never again be so lengthy a gap between versions of its operating system. Industry analysts expect that Microsoft will more regularly update Windows with new features and bug fixes delivered over the Internet -- and that the line between the desktop software and Internet software will increasingly blur.  ''Today will go down in computing history as the last big operating system launch for Microsoft,'' said Gary Beach, publisher of CIO Magazine, a publication for professional technology managers.  For those upgrading from previous versions of Windows, there are three versions of Vista, from $100 to $260. The new operating system has striking three-dimensional graphics, an easier-to-use interface and improved security, and it handles games, music, video and pictures far better than previous generations of Windows, most product reviewers have agreed. But many reviewers have also pointed out that most of the new features in Vista are already in Apple's Macintosh computers.  Mr. Ballmer and Bill Gates, the chairman, presided over a gathering in a Times Square theater to celebrate Vista's arrival, along with industry partners, analysts, and early Vista users, or beta testers. One was Farage Yusupov, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Some Vista features, he said, did not run on his two-year-old laptop.  But Mr. Yusupov said he planned to get a new computer with Vista soon. ''In a year or two, every computer is going to have it,'' he said. ''Since I'm going to get it sooner or later, I want it sooner.''  Microsoft's industry partners described Vista as a watershed. Hector Ruiz, the chairman of Advanced Micro Devices, a microprocessor maker, said the new Microsoft operating system would usher in ''the visualization age of computing'' with rich 3-D graphics entering the mainstream. ''And stunning visual experiences require outstanding hardware,'' Mr. Ruiz added.  Kevin B. Rollins, Dell's chief executive, said his company began taking orders online over the weekend for Vista-equipped machines. Traffic on the company's Web site increased 20 percent because of demand for PC's running Vista, and tens of thousands of them have been sold in the last couple of days, Mr. Rollins said.  Sean Maloney, executive vice president of Intel, said that Vista's abilities combined with rapidly advancing technology in microchips would lead to a ''golden age for PCs,'' allowing them to serve as a central hub for storing, managing and sending digital media like movies and music to television sets and music players in the home.  In an interview, Mr. Bradley of Hewlett-Packard pointed to his company's TouchSmart PC, being released to coincide with Vista's debut, to show that manufacturers are increasingly able to use Microsoft's operating system as ''a platform we can build around instead of just embed on our machines.''  The $1,699 model, with a 20-inch touch screen and television tuner built in, has a user interface that has been tailored by Hewlett-Packard engineers so that it looks different from a standard Windows machine. Microsoft's antitrust settlement with the federal government required the software maker to give PC makers more freedom to modify Windows.  Most of Microsoft's vast marketing budget will be on print, television, radio and Web advertisements. But some will go for so-called viral marketing events like an online puzzle contest called Vanishing Point, sponsored by Microsoft and A.M.D. The winner will get a ride into space from a private space travel company.  The strategy, said Michael Sievert, vice president for Windows marketing, ''is really about getting people to come in and have a look.''  ",

            "text": "  WILLIAM D. WATKINS has seven terabytes of data storage tucked into a cabinet in the media room of his beach home in Aptos, Calif. That is not a big thing for Mr. Watkins, the chief executive of Seagate, which makes hard disk drives. But it is enough space to hold 600,000 songs, 584,000 photographs and 1,000 hours of TV shows.  All of that material can be displayed on the giant flat-panel TV spread across one wall in the media room and distributed to the six TVs and numerous speakers throughout the house.  Call it tech envy, but I wondered if I could set up a system on a wireless home network so my own photos, videos and movies could be viewed from any TV in the house, and an entire collection of music could be summoned from any stereo. Could I do it with equipment available at a big chain like Best Buy or Circuit City?  ''The answer to that is easy: no,'' said Dan Sokol, a technology analyst with the Envisioneering Group, electronic engineering consultants in Seaford, N.Y. The problem, according to Mr. Sokol, is that there are dozens of pieces of incompatible electronic equipment involved in this kind of project.  I refused to take Mr. Sokol's ''no'' for an answer -- and set out to build a home media network for less than $1,000. I understood there would be plenty of hurdles. Devices coming out of the world of information technology, like PCs and networking equipment, are just beginning to communicate with the devices that come out of the world of home electronics, like TVs and stereos.  Both industries have been working out standards through an alphabet soup of trade associations. They are hoping that all of those devices, and cellphones, printers and digital cameras, will start making sense to each other this year. Best Buy just started selling a whole system in a box that will handle entertainment and control your thermostats and lights for $15,000.  Device manufacturers are convinced that consumers will want interconnectivity. Parks Associates, a technology industry consulting firm, estimates that by 2010, some 30 million American homes will have a home entertainment network. (Right now only about half of the 43 million American homes with broadband Internet connections even have a home network, so this seems like an optimistic projection.)  ''Connected entertainment is near and dear to our heart,'' said Jan-Luc Blakborn, director of digital entertainment at Hewlett-Packard. ''We clearly see connected entertainment as an area where we can grow. It is starting to happen.''  At present I can buy a Sonos or Squeezebox device to play music throughout the house -- but those can only handle music. Another device, the Slingbox, can send TV programs to a PC anywhere in the world over the Internet. But I do not want to watch TV on a 15-inch notebook screen when I can watch it on a 42-inch TV.  Then there is TiVo. It had the potential to become the leading home entertainment hub. A free download of TiVo Desktop software to a PC allows video from your TiVo to be watched anywhere and anytime on that PC. If you have a second TV, any program recorded on one TiVo box can stream effortlessly to any other TiVo elsewhere in the house.  But this is really an example of a lost opportunity. TiVo stores video in a proprietary digital format that prevents it from being viewed on non-TiVo devices, and the files are not recognized by other hardware, which is the problem that led Mr. Sokol to declare that my efforts would be futile.  James Denney, vice president for product marketing at TiVo, said the company had not set out to be the center of everything. ''Our approach is that there isn't one hub in the house,'' he said. ''Our role is a display device near the TV.''  TiVo also does nothing for my collection of DVDs. It is difficult to watch a movie on DVD over a home network without first copying it to a hard drive. Software for doing this is widely available, but it is illegal to bypass the copy protection on a DVD, even one that you own. Systems for sending copy-protected video around the house are still largely works in progress.  Another problem I encountered was a lack of advice. Few of the devices needed to assemble my network are even advertised by retailers or manufacturers. Sony, for instance, has a number of devices under the LocationFree name that can be used to move TV shows to a PlayStation Portable game machine or a small TV monitor outdoors, but it seems to be keeping this a secret. Hewlett-Packard is selling what it calls the MediaSmart TV, a 37-inch L.C.D. set that locates your wireless home network and pulls in content. It is a nice product, but it will not work for this project; it costs $2,000.  To build a homemade networked entertainment system, I needed a network, of course. Older wireless routers using the 802.11b standard will move video data so slowly that it will be nearly unwatchable. So the wireless router has to be upgraded to 802.11g or the even newer 802.11n standard.  Here is where this project started getting expensive. Wireless devices anywhere on the network that are still using the older technology will slow the whole network. I have to upgrade them, too, for about $50 each.  Music, movies and photos can be stored on the hard drive of any computer connected to the network. But because TV shows or movies can fill up a PC's hard drive much faster than photos or music files do, it can make sense to centralize everything on an always-available external hard drive.  ''The way I view it, being a nerd, the storage device is as important as the media center,'' said Mike Scott, technical media manager at D-Link, a maker of home networking equipment.  There are now drives on the market that can hold as much as a terabyte, enough space to hold about 90 hours of high-definition TV. That much storage will cost a bit more than $500, but prices keep falling.  I decided to use a kind of external hard drive known as a network-attached storage device. Although they cost about $100 more than regular drives, they come with software that will organize files and help all the devices on the network find the drive. The Maxtor Shared Storage II drive that I chose, which holds 1 terabyte and costs about $680, was up and running in less than 10 minutes.  One alternative is buy a $100 device called a network storage link that is plugged in between a regular external drive and the router. That offers more flexibility if I buy a lower-capacity drive that needs to be upgraded later.  The next step is attaching a media adapter to a TV or a stereo to pick up the programming from the network. D-Link sells one called the MediaLounge Media Player for less than $300. (A fancier model just hit the market for $600.) This is essentially a DVD player with a built-in wireless adapter that enables it to locate photos, movies and music on the network's hard drives. A similar device from D-Link, which costs about $180, can connect to any stereo receiver so that music files are always accessible. The drawback is that I needed one of these adapters for every TV and stereo.  The home entertainment network that I jury-rigged wasn't nearly as slick as Mr. Watkins's setup. But then it only cost me about $850, not including the cost of my existing computers and TV. I spent more time moving music and video files to the hard drive than I spent actually setting it up. Once the content was there, I could do exactly what I wanted to do: view whatever I wanted, wherever I wanted.  If all of this sounds like too much effort, you can always wait. Almost every consumer electronics company is set to announce its answer to home entertainment connectivity at the Consumer Electronics Show next week. As with all consumer electronics, the devices coming out next year will do more for less. I can only hope they will be just a little bit easier to put together.  BASICS  ",

            "text": "  Consumers wary of buying new high-definition DVD players because of a technology war reminiscent of the days of Betamax versus VHS will soon have a new kind of DVD that might make the decision less daunting.  Warner Brothers, which helped popularize the DVD more than a decade ago, plans to announce next week a single videodisc that can play films and television programs in both Blu-ray and HD-DVD, the rival DVD technologies.  Warner Brothers, a division of Time Warner, plans to formally announce the new disc, which it is calling a Total HD disc, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.  Two rival camps introduced high-definition DVD players last year: a consortium called Blu-ray, backed by Sony and others, and a group called HD-DVD, backed by Toshiba and Microsoft. Retail and media executives say this clash of corporate titans and their incompatible machines has left some consumers bewildered and has slowed the introduction of what is intended to be the next great thing in home entertainment.  Executives at Time Warner and its Hollywood subsidiary hope to spur sales of new DVD players and movies by gaining the support of retailers and cajoling rival studios into making their film and television libraries available in both formats on a single disc.  In addition to reviving the ghost of the war that marked the introduction of videocassettes in the 1980s, the high-definition battle has been exacerbated by the decision of several major studios to support only one of the technologies.  Thus, for instance, a copy of 20th Century Fox's ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' is available only on Blu-ray, while Universal's ''The Break-Up'' can be viewed only on a disc and player built with HD-DVD technology.  Barry M. Meyer, the chairman and chief executive of Warner Brothers, said in an interview that the company came up with the Total HD disc after concluding that neither Blu-ray nor HD-DVD was going the way of Betamax anytime soon.  ''The next best thing is to recognize that there will be two formats and to make that not a negative for the consumer,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''We felt that the most significant constituency for us to satisfy was the consumer first, and the retailer second. The retailer wants to sell hardware and doesn't want to be forced into stocking two formats for everything. This is ideal for them.''  In a world besotted with gadgetry, few consumer products have generated as much excitement -- and head-scratching -- as high-definition television. Flat-screen, high-definition TVs have been flying off the shelves for the last year and are now as common in homes as coffee pots. Yet few people are actually watching superclear high-definition programming.  Part of the disconnect is the lack of high-definition programming on cable and satellite television, and the additional outlay for decoder boxes and premium channels needed to get it. The rival movie player technologies have further blurred the outlook for high definition. Richard Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Capital, predicted in a recent report that this would be the first year since the introduction of the DVD that consumer spending on the discs would decline, putting pressure on the studios that rely heavily on them for profits.  For now, Sony; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which is owned by private equity firms in partnership with the Comcast Corporation and Sony; 20th Century Fox, a division of the News Corporation; and Walt Disney Pictures are all exclusively releasing their DVDs in Blu-ray.  Universal Studios, which is owned by General Electric, is releasing only in HD-DVD. Warner and Paramount Pictures, a division of Viacom, are issuing DVDs in both formats.  Behind these allegiances are complex strategic questions revolving around everything from manufacturing costs to profit margins, debates over each format's technical strengths and weaknesses, and how these players relate to Microsoft and Sony's video-game strategies.  (Blu-ray players are built into the new Sony PlayStation 3, while Microsoft is selling HD-DVD drives that attach to its Xbox 360.)  Another wrinkle is plans by LG Electronics, and possibly other gadget makers attending the Las Vegas conference, to announce new DVD players with drives for both formats; however, such players will most likely be initially more expensive than other players.  Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the president of Time Warner, said the Total HD disc has a better chance of catching on than dual players. Research commissioned by Warner indicates that consumers are willing to pay several dollars more than current high-definition DVDs for a disc that works on both players. At the Web site for Best Buy, Warner's ''Superman Returns'' DVD was selling yesterday for $19.99 in its standard format, $29.99 for Blu-ray and $34.99 for HD-DVD.  Still, it is not clear whether news of Warner's Total HD disc would convince the studio heads who are backing one format or the other to release their wares in both. Sony, of course, has placed a big bet on Blu-ray's success and does not want to relive the sting of Betamax's defeat. The number of studios committed solely to Blu-ray has been seen as a competitive edge, particularly because HD-DVD came to market several months ahead of Blu-ray.  And HD-DVD's boosters say they doubt gaming fans who have been snapping up the just-introduced PlayStation 3 will take advantage of its built-in Blu-ray player and buy movies as well as video games.  In recent interviews, executives at Fox and Disney were unequivocal in their support for Blu-ray. They said they believed that releasing DVDs in both formats would only prolong confusion and the emergence of a winning format. ''I think the fastest way to end the format war is through decisiveness and strength,'' said Bob Chapek, the president of Buena Vista Worldwide Entertainment, the home video arm of Walt Disney.  Like other Blu-ray proponents and partners, Mr. Chapek said that he favors Blu-ray because of its greater storage capacity and other attributes. HD-DVD offers the same vivid picture by storing less information on its disc, which means fewer minutes of video and other features. However, among its perceived advantages, HD-DVD players are less expensive and also play standard DVDs, while Blu-ray players do not.  Because of manufacturing complexities, the Total HD disc will not contain a standard format version, said Kevin Tsujihara, the president of Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Group. However, several months ago the company filed patents for a new disc incorporating all three formats, which it could produce in the future.  Mr. Tsujihara described the new disc as an elegant way for studios to make their content available more widely ''in a way that is not conceding defeat'' for the format they have been backing.  In the short term, Total HD would actually add to the number of formats retailers will have to stock, raising it from three to four. However, Irynne V. MacKay, senior vice president for entertainment products at Circuit City, said she supported the idea because it took pressure off consumers puzzling over which format to invest in. ''The simpler the future is for us, the better,'' said Ms. MacKay.  Correction:  January 5, 2007, Friday  An article in Business Day yesterday about a proposed high-definition videodisc that will play on rival technologies referred incorrectly to one capability of the Blu-ray players, a rival to the HD-DVD technology. Blu-Ray players do, in fact, play standard DVDs, as do HD-DVD players. One difference is that some new HD-DVD discs are sold in a combination format that will also play on standard DVD players, while Blu-Ray discs currently do not have this feature.  ",

            "text": "  People often say they do not like advertisements, but that may change if the ads start lowering their cellphone bills.  Cellular phone carriers like Verizon, Sprint and Cingular, now the new AT&T, are beginning to test and roll out advertising on mobile phone screens, and by next year, cellphone advertising is likely to be more common.  In exchange, the companies say, their subscribers will enjoy improved mobile Internet services and content provided free or at reduced prices. Other companies like Virgin Mobile USA and Amp'd Mobile are taking the idea a step further, rewarding customers for viewing ads by lowering their cellphone bills.  Amp'd, a cellphone company that aims its marketing at 18- to 24-year-olds in the United States, will begin offering an opt-in advertising plan this year. Customers who sign up will gain access to free shows and other content -- if they are willing to put up with some ads.  ''When people are consuming this stuff on their phones, it adds up to a lot of money,'' said Brian Mullen, director for content business development for Amp'd.  Another company, Xero Mobile, plans to distribute one million free cellphones on college campuses across the United States this year and give customers 40 percent off on their calling plans, if they watch up to four commercials a day, said Rich Clayton, a spokesman for Xero. In Britain, a company called Blyk plans to provide a completely free plan on phones that are paid for by ads.  It was inevitable that advertising would hit the small screen sooner or later, industry analysts said. Cellphones are the most pervasive media device, beating out computers and televisions, as consumers keep their mobile phones at their side nearly every moment of the day.  A small but growing number of consumers, in particular, younger ones, are using their mobile phones for text messaging, surfing the mobile Internet, watching short shows, taking photos or videos and checking e-mail messages. Only time will tell if cellphones are destined to become like all other forms of media -- supported by both subscription costs and by advertising.  Still, these new phone services will become mainstream only if their prices are lowered, possibly through advertising, analysts said. On average, consumers in the United States spend $50 to $60 a month for cellphone service, including data features. The average total bill has been flat for the last few years, even as voice call charges have decreased, because of the increase in fees for text messages and mobile e-mail messages.  ''Advertising absolutely makes sense to extend expensive multimedia services and mobile TV to the mass market,'' said Linda Barrabee, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a technology research and consulting firm based in Boston. ''I think we will see consumers say, 'You know what, I'm only going to spend this much money on my mobile phone.' ''  In Asia, by contrast, multimedia mobile applications are more commonly used, and those services became more affordable there without advertising because of quick adaptation by consumers, analysts said.  The new uses of cellphones present vast opportunities for consumer brand companies, which are finding it difficult to reach customers through traditional media like magazines and television. Mobile phones can handle ads in many forms, including video, text messages, search and banner displays. And cellphone ads can be fine-tuned based on customer data.  But there is a chicken-and-egg factor when it comes to advertising. Big advertisers generally want to see further adoption of services before they pour significant money into mobile ads. Advertisers like Procter & Gamble, Burger King and Pepsi have been experimenting with mobile phone ads, but, in total, cellphone advertising generated only about $421 million in the United States last year, according to eMarketer, a digital advertising research firm. EMarketer predicted this month that mobile advertising would reach $4.8 billion across the country by 2011.  Despite the hopeful thinking, there is no guarantee mobile ads will catch on. ''I would not want them on the phone even if that would help cut costs,'' said Conor Kelly, 20, a student at Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia. Mr. Kelly said he did not mind subtle sponsorships of content on his phone, but he would not want it go beyond that.  ''It gets to a point where you're almost encroaching on someone's privacy,'' Mr. Kelly said.  In the early days of the commercial Internet, some service providers tried giving away online access in exchange for showing ads to users, but those efforts did not pan out.  For the subsidized approach to work this time around, cellphone companies must prove that consumers pay attention to ads. ''We have to ensure that the models that we pursue are those that actually get seen and acted on by consumers,'' said Marc Lefar, chief marketing officer for AT&T's wireless unit, which used to be called Cingular Wireless. AT&T is testing various forms of cellphone advertising, with introduction of ads planned this year.  As of now, text messaging is the most common venue for mobile phone ads. Signs, food packaging and even TV spots feature a code that phone users can text to be entered in promotions. 1-800-Flowers, for example, is running a sweepstakes in the New York area for a flower arrangement that comes in a small margarita glass. Next week, Nike will allow consumers to alter one of its TV commercials online and send their creations to their friends' phones.  Some consumers may not realize that opt-in text message ads generate a charge for those who pay for each incoming text message. Such costs have deterred some marketers from creating mobile ads, said Sarah Kim Baehr, vice president for media at Avenue A Razorfish, an interactive ad agency that is part of aQuantive.  As mobile phones are used for more tasks, ads will pop up increasingly in more varied forms, ad executives said. Preroll video ads have already started to appear. Advertisers like Toyota have created 10-second commercials to run before miniepisodes of Fox shows, and the network promotes the strategy as a great way to reach a young audience.  ''Look around,'' said Mitch Feinman, senior vice president of Fox Mobile Entertainment. ''All the young males and kids, they're on their mobiles.''  Advertisers are generally paying a high price to try cellphone ads, about $40 for a thousand viewings of their ads, or twice as much as many TV spots, analysts said. The performance of these ads over the next year or so will determine whether they are likely to provide enough income to justify giving customers a price break on service fees.  Some companies are not waiting to find out. Virgin Mobile USA introduced a program last summer it calls Sugar Mama that compensates its phone users with free calling minutes for watching commercials, reading advertiser text messages and taking surveys from brands. Since last July, about 250,000 phone users have participated, earning a total of about three million minutes, said Howard Handler, chief marketing officer of Virgin Mobile USA.  Advertisers like the United States Navy and Levi Strauss Signature are showing ads through Virgin Mobile USA's program, in part, because they liked the idea of compensating consumers for the time they spend watching their ads. ''It gives us the assurance that our message is being heard,'' said Stacy Doren, director for media and online at Levis Strauss Signature.  The carriers have so far been wary of exposing their customers to ads because the wireless marketplace is so competitive, said Scott A. Ellison, vice president for mobile at IDC, a technology and communications research firm.  ''Advertisers are always hungry for new ways to reach people, however that's a little scary for the carriers because they're concerned over how the end user experience will be impacted,'' Mr. Ellison said.  Google and Yahoo are also investing in mobile advertising, moving their search capacities to phones and selling sponsored search ads. Google executives have said publicly that they think phone service will one day be free and supported by advertising.  If advertising on mobile phones generates enough income to offer significant phone subsidies, many companies will probably allow phone users to choose whether they want ads, analysts said.  There are some consumers who would not want much advertising, no matter the price break. Younger consumers, whose parents do not want to upgrade their phones, and lower-income shoppers who cannot afford the upgrades may be the most receptive to ads.  Future ad packages might include free text messaging for people who agree to receive text message ads, said Roger Wood, senior vice president and general manager of the Americas region for Amobee Media Services, a company that is working with cellphone companies to test advertising-financed services in the United States and abroad. Underwriting mobile phone services would be a good opportunity for brands to provide value to customers rather than just blasting them with messages, said Mark Kingdon, the chief executive of Organic, a digital ad agency and part of the Omnicom Group.  Danny Herb, an avid text messager, said he would welcome advertising if it helped him cover his phone's mobile video and Internet capacities. Mr. Herb, 25, said he did not use other features on his phone because they were expensive. But he said he would use them if they were free with ads.  ''I wouldn't pay for mobile Internet or video,'' Mr. Herb said. ''My text messaging costs me too much.''  ",

            "text": "  CASUAL game sites have learned how to play the ad game.  The sites -- which offer puzzle and strategy games -- once focused on selling the actual games after the dot-com bust drove many advertisers away. But these days, they are becoming popular marketing spots as they begin to accept more branded messages.  Last year, advertisers spent about $150 million buying space on casual game sites or in the games themselves, up from $74 million in 2002, according to DFC Intelligence, a game industry research firm in San Diego.  This is all possible, of course, because advertisers are increasingly interested in reaching the diverse group of Web users who like to solve puzzles, play word games and decipher mind benders online.  In December, about 65.9 million people played online games, which include puzzle games and action video games. That was up 13 percent from December 2005, when 58.4 million clicked online for a quick round, according to comScore Networks, an Internet research firm. While traditional action games still draw more men than women, casual games are more popular with women and offer the kind of friendly online experience that ad executives say companies want to be associated with.  Big Fish Games, a casual game site known for its game Mystery Case Files, for example, says about 75 percent of its visitors each month are women. And, according to Forrester Research, about 51 percent of people over age 30 play online games.  ''The gamer is actually a much more of a mainstream consumer than you may think,'' said Shar VanBoskirk, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. ''Consumers are really filtering out advertiser messages, and games are one way that they're actually still engaged.''  PopCap Games, a company known for the Bejeweled puzzle game, is testing ads in the premiere versions of its games. Like many online games, PopCap's are available in two versions -- a free basic version and a fancier version for a fee, which it calls premiere. Traditionally, Web surfers tried the fancy version free for an hour before deciding whether to buy it.  Now, under a test PopCap is running with its game Zuma, consumers can download the fancy version and play it without ever paying -- if they are willing to see ads.  AOL Games, a unit of Time Warner, is testing ads in the one-hour trial version of its deluxe games, said Ralph Rivera, vice president and general manager of AOL Games. About 95 percent of people who try games do not end up paying for the deluxe version, he said, and AOL would like to reach those users in some way.  ''Within AOL, games is only second to e-mail and I.M. as far as time spent per user, so you're talking about a very highly engaged audience,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''Any time you have a highly engaged audience, you have advertisers who are looking to get in front of that audience.''  Big Fish Games charges for downloads of games and also carries about 200 free puzzle and strategy games online, with ads. Starting last month, visitors who clicked on their first free online game of the day got a Sponsor Select pop-up screen giving them a choice of ads for that game.  About 25 percent of the people who play games on Big Fish have chosen to pick their advertisers, according to AWS Convergence Technologies, the company that operates Sponsor Select.  Yesterday, for example, visitors could select either Better Homes and Gardens, Orchard Bank MasterCard or Windows Live Search to be the sole advertiser in the first game they played. The rest of the games they played showed them a variety of ads.  ''You're going to get ads no matter what,'' said Paul Thelen, chief executive of Big Fish Games. ''The advantage of Sponsor Select is it's more likely to be relevant to you.''  Big Fish started offering free games online a year and a half ago. Four years ago, after the dot-com bust, it was not possible to make much money from ad-supported games, Mr. Thelen said. Now that is changing. While Big Fish still makes most of its money from user-paid downloads, its fastest-growing revenue area is its advertising.  Whereas advertising in games used to be specialized, involving a lot of negotiation , the growing number of ad options for casual games is making game advertising more accessible to brands that once focused on traditional advertising, ad executives said.  ''You don't have to be as adventurous or as bold to make it happen now,'' said Art Sindlinger, vice president and activation director at Starcom USA, a Publicis Groupe media-buying agency.  One appealing aspect of casual games is that players often start friendly dialogues with each other, and brands can associate themselves with that community building, said Saneel Radia, vice president and group director of Play, a gaming division of Denuo, which is part of the Publicis Groupe.  ''If you look at the communication on a board of pool in Yahoo Games, it's, 'Oh, where's your family from?' '' Mr. Radia said. ''Go to XBox Live, and it's, 'I'm going to crush you.' ''  Some advertisers have taken casual gaming a step further, creating their own casual games -- sometimes called advergames -- and posting them on their Web sites.  When the Dodge Caliber came out last spring, the Chrysler Group, part of DaimlerChrysler, posted five casual games on its site, and one called Caliber Buzz was played three million times within a month, said Vanessa Kelley, manager of cross-brand gaming at Chrysler. Online games are now a regular part of Chrysler car debuts, she said.  ''It's the wave,'' Ms. Kelley said. ''These people don't watch television all that much. They are online. They're playing games.''  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING  ",

            "text": "  After six years of trying to build an online music service, AOL agreed yesterday to sell its AOL Music Now to Napster. Napster will pay $15 million to add AOL's 350,000 subscribers to its own 566,000.  The price amounts to $43 a subscriber, which appears low considering that Napster -- which only sells a music service -- is valued at $186 million, or $328 a subscriber.  One reason may be that AOL's music business has been shrinking quickly. It had 450,000 subscribers in the middle of 2006, when the company stopped marketing the service as part of a shift away from fee-based businesses.  ''AOL is treating this like a nonessential business,'' said Fred Moran, an analyst with the Stanford Group. He said the deal was positive for Napster, which disclosed in September that it had hired investment bankers to evaluate potential acquisition offers. The bankers are still working, said a Napster spokeswoman, Dana M. Harris, who would offer no details.  Napster's shares rose by 30 cents, to $4.12.  AOL is now focused on free sites supported by advertising, and it continues to operate AOL Music, the second-most-popular music destination on the Internet.  AOL first helped found MusicNet, a consortium that included several record labels and the digital media company RealNetworks. It introduced a music service based on MusicNet in 2003. In October 2005, AOL bought Music Now, a similar service that had been owned by the electronics retailer Circuit City. The price was reported at the time to be $10 million to $15 million, although AOL would not confirm it.  AOL's services, much like Napster and Rhapsody, which is now owned by RealNetworks, mainly offer subscriptions for unlimited song downloads, but the songs stop playing if the customer does not pay the monthly bill.  This model has not proved to be as popular as the \u00e0 la carte model used by Apple's iTunes Store. One reason is that music from the subscription services cannot be played on Apple's popular iPod players. AOL, Rhapsody and Napster all use software from Microsoft that lets their songs play on a variety of players from Samsung, Creative, iRiver and other manufacturers. But none of these devices have come close to challenging the iPod. Microsoft further confused the market last year when it introduced its Zune player, which was not compatible with any subscription services other than its own.  This month, the Virgin Group said that it would close its Virgin Digital music service.  AOL and Napster both charge new customers $9.95 a month if they want to listen to music only on a computer and $14.95 a month if they want to use a portable player as well. Some AOL subscribers have been paying $8.95 a month, and Napster will continue to honor that price for them. AOL customers will be converted to Napster unless they choose to cancel their subscriptions.  As part of the arrangement, Napster, based in Los Angeles, will promote its service on AOL's music pages, and it will make additional payments to AOL if it reaches certain new subscriber targets.

            "text": "  Verizon Wireless is expected to announce on Sunday that it will offer full-length programming to its cellular subscribers from several major television networks, according to people apprised of the deal.  The service, which should be in operation by the end of March, will consist of eight channels and will include popular shows from NBC, CBS, Fox and MTV, they said. ESPN is reportedly also in negotiations to offer programs, which will be offered for the cellphone screen soon after they appear on television.  What is significant is that the programs will be among the first full-length television shows to be offered to cellular subscribers in the United States. In Europe, where mobile phone technology is more advanced, such programming is more widely available.  It will also make the mobile phone more competitive with devices like the iPod from Apple Computer. In 2005, Apple announced that it would offer shows from the Walt Disney Company's ABC network for sale through its iTunes Store. Other entertainment companies quickly followed suit.  Media companies will receive a fee based on consumer subscriptions. A spokesman for Verizon Wireless could not be reached for comment on Friday evening.  In the deal, Verizon is joining with MediaFLO U.S.A., a subsidiary of Qualcomm, which has created technology to transmit high-resolution video through its own dedicated network. MediaFLO's quality rivals European and Asian standards, media executives say.  Verizon Wireless and Qualcomm have been partners for some time; they first announced an agreement to work together in 2005. MediaFLO was reported by those apprised of the Verizon deal to be in talks to offer television shows through other wireless phone companies as well.  Samsung and LG are two phone makers whose equipment is compatible with the MediaFLO network.  ",

            "text": "  The 2005 science fiction film ''Serenity'' portrayed a ragtag crew of space pirates fighting to unravel the mysteries of their galaxy.  Reality may now be mimicking fiction.  Last weekend, a loose-knit coalition of hackers around the world defeated the antipiracy software protecting several high-resolution movies in the HD DVD format. They then began distributing copies of the films -- starting with Universal Pictures' ''Serenity'' -- using BitTorrent, a popular file-sharing tool.  The move could send the technology companies behind the new wave of advanced DVDs scrambling back to the drawing board to improve their copy protection, and prompt Hollywood studios to rethink their alliances in the war between the HD DVD and Blu-ray formats.  The HD DVD standard is backed by Toshiba, Microsoft and Intel and uses copy protection technology known as the Advanced Access Content System. The rival Blu-ray format, supported by Sony, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, uses the same system but adds a level of software that acts as a backup when the first level is compromised, so it is considered to be slightly more secure.  A spokeswoman for Universal, the only film studio to back the HD DVD format exclusively, said no executives were available to discuss the HD DVD issue.  The new intrusions came less than a month after a programmer calling himself Muslix64 announced in a Web forum that he had unraveled at least part of the HD DVD protection system. Muslix64 released free software that allows users to insert HD DVDs into their computers and make copies of those films without the original encryption. However, to make it work, users still needed a special title key, generated by the A.A.C.S. software, for each movie they were trying to copy.  Muslix did not provide any title keys -- in a sense challenging others to finish his work. On Saturday, the response came in the form of dozens of keys for movies like ''King Kong,'' ''Mission Impossible: 3'' and ''Superman Returns,'' posted on Web forums like those at Doom9.net. At least two Web sites were created to provide lists of the keys.  Security experts said that the hackers appeared to have discovered the secret keys on their own computers -- stashed there by WinDVD, a commercial program for playing DVDs.  Michael Ayers, a lawyer for Toshiba who is chairman of the business group of the trade organization that administers A.A.C.S., acknowledged that the intrusion was serious, but said he viewed it as an attack on DVD-playing software and not the overall protection system for HD DVD.  ''It's like somebody picked the lock on an individual house, but he has not discovered the secrets to lock-making at the master padlock company,'' Mr. Ayers said.  He added that A.A.C.S. was explicitly designed so that compromised players and programs like WinDVD can be disabled remotely by revoking their licenses. He said the A.A.C.S. group might take that approach after an investigation.  Bill Rosenblatt, president of the consulting firm GiantSteps which specializes in content protection issues, said the intrusion was less of a crisis than the 1999 defeat of the encryption that protects standard DVDs, which allowed movie files to be freely copied and shared online.  ''It's a pretty nice victory for hackers, but this newer scheme was designed to fail more gracefully and not be as brittle as the DVD scheme,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said.  However, some security experts said the intrusions were more serious. Bruce Schneier, the chief technology officer of the security company BT Counterpane, said it was unclear what effect revoking licenses would have. If new discs of the movies are updated with new title codes, the old discs in stores will still be vulnerable. And hackers will surely redouble efforts to crack the new discs.  Mr. Schneier said the new DVDs would inevitably be vulnerable to hacking. ''Data is inherently copyable, just as water is inherently wet,'' he said. ''All the technology companies are doing is putting in tricks to make it harder to copy. But all they are is tricks.''  ",

            "text": "  For the third time in less than three months, Wal-Mart Stores has made major decisions affecting the advertising agencies that handle its giant marketing assignments.  Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, chose two agencies yesterday -- the Martin Agency and MediaVest -- to handle important assignments for ads that the company aims at mainstream consumers and that appear in major media like television, magazines and the Internet. Wal-Mart spends an estimated $580 million a year on such ads.  The announcement came five weeks after Wal-Mart stunned Madison Avenue by overturning decisions made by senior marketing executives on Oct. 25 to hire the Draft FCB Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, as the lead agency to create ads, and Carat USA, part of the Aegis Group, to handle what is called media planning and buying -- that is, determining where ads run and how much to pay for them.  Wal-Mart attributed the reconsideration to what were described as improprieties in the selection process involving Draft FCB and two Wal-Mart marketing executives, Julie Roehm and Sean Womack, who were subsequently fired. Ms. Roehm and Mr. Womack have denied any wrongdoing.  Wal-Mart barred Draft FCB from taking part in the new selection during the holiday shopping season, but invited Carat USA to try again, which it did, only to fall short the second time.  Wal-Mart let another agency owned by Interpublic, the Martin Agency, participate in the second round as it had in the first. That paid off for Interpublic as Martin was chosen to replace Draft FCB as the creative agency.  Martin is best known for its popular gecko ads for Geico insurance and campaigns for United Parcel Service that celebrate the color brown.  ''We are very pleased with Wal-Mart's decision,'' Interpublic said in a statement.  Shares of Interpublic fell sharply on Dec. 7, when the creative assignment was taken from Draft FCB. They climbed 33 cents, or 2.5 percent, to close at $13.37 yesterday.  In the second review, Martin bested one other agency for the creative assignment, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group. Ogilvy had also taken part in the first review and accepted Wal-Mart's invitation to participate again.  Carat USA lost this time as MediaVest, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe, was chosen to handle the media assignments.  Carat USA and MediaVest vied in the second review against Mediaedge:cia, also owned by WPP. Other large advertisers that use MediaVest include Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble -- two of Wal-Mart's biggest suppliers.  Martin and MediaVest were chosen for their ''deep retail experience, recognized creativity and an understanding of our customers,'' John Fleming, chief marketing officer at Wal-Mart, said in a statement.  Wal-Mart originally began scrutinizing its advertising agencies in May after working for decades with two, Bernstein-Rein and GSD&M. The review was part of a comprehensive reassessment by Wal-Mart of how it speaks to consumers, spurred by a slowdown in sales growth and increased competition from rivals like Kohl's and Target.  Wal-Mart has been struggling to find the right balance in its ads between playing up low prices on items like pantry staples and basic clothing or promoting pricier products like flat-screen TV sets and designer clothing.  Bernstein-Rein, a Wal-Mart agency since 1974, was notified in August that it would not be rehired. GSD&M, part of the Omnicom Group, a Wal-Mart agency since 1987, was notified Oct. 25 that it had lost its assignments.  After Wal-Mart declared the do-over last month, it invited GSD&M to take part, but executives at the agency declined.  Also yesterday, Wal-Mart named three agencies to handle assignments aimed at multicultural consumers. Those assignments were being reviewed separately from the creative and media assignments for the general market.  Global Hue was named to create ads aimed at black shoppers. The IW Group was chosen for ads for Asian-American consumers. And L\u00f3pez Negrete Communications was selected for ads aimed at Spanish-speaking shoppers.  ",

            "text": "  Linux, the free operating system, has gone from an intriguing experiment to a mainstream technology in corporate data centers, helped by the backing of major technology companies like I.B.M., Intel and Hewlett-Packard, which sponsored industry consortiums to promote its adoption.  Those same companies have decided that the time has come to consolidate their collaborative support into a new group, the Linux Foundation, which is being announced today. And the mission of the new organization is help Linux, the leading example of the open-source model of software development, to compete more effectively against Microsoft, the world's largest software company.  ''It's really a two-horse race now, with computing dominated by two operating-system platforms, Linux and Windows,'' said James Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation. ''There are things that Microsoft does well in terms of promoting Windows, providing legal protection and standardizing Windows.''  He added that ''the things that Microsoft does well are things we need to do well -- to promote, protect and standardize Linux.''  In data centers, both Linux and Microsoft have benefited from the shift to data-serving computers powered by lower-cost microprocessors and other industry-standard hardware using personal computer technology. These machines, running Linux or Windows, have increasingly replaced more costly, proprietary hardware, typically running Unix operating systems.  That shift to industry-standard hardware has helped makers of personal computer chips like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, and makers of PC-technology machines including Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Dell, NEC and Fujitsu.  Traditional rivals of Microsoft in the software business, including Oracle and I.B.M., have championed Linux to undermine an adversary and have tweaked their database and other software programs to run on Linux. Companies like Red Hat and Novell distribute Linux and charge companies for technical support and maintenance.  So while Linux is distributed free, a sizable market has grown up around it. The yearly sales of Linux-related hardware, software and services is more than $14.5 billion, according to estimates by IDC, a research firm.  The new Linux organization is ''a clear sign that we are going to continue to work together,'' said Daniel D. Frye, vice president for open systems development at I.B.M.  There is vigorous competition among companies in the market for hardware, software and services that work with Linux, Mr. Frye said. But collaboration is also essential to move Linux technology forward, he said, and avoid the kind of splintering of the marketplace that occurred in the 1980s, when different companies supported different versions of the Unix operating system.  The work of two other groups -- the Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group -- will be folded into the Linux Foundation, and those organizations will no longer exist. Mr. Zemlin had been the head of the Free Standards Group.  Stuart F. Cohen, the chief executive of the Open Source Development Labs, said he was starting a new venture that would use the open-source development model to build software applications tailored for individual industries like financial services.  The Linux Foundation will pay salaries to Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, and a few other key Linux programmers. That support had previously come from the Open Source Development Labs.  In an e-mail message, Mr. Torvalds noted that some of the original reasons for forming the Open Source Development Labs six years ago, like ''helping companies come to grips with Linux and open source in general,'' had in large part been addressed.  Referring to the new organization, he said, ''The technical, legal and standards issues do seem to be part of a bigger whole.''  Mr. Torvalds said his role would not change. ''I work on the technology itself, not any of the other issues,'' he wrote. ''I literally just sit in my basement and do technical management. Nothing else.''  TECHNOLOGY  ",

The expansion, known as the Burning Crusade, is expected to be one of this year's top-selling games and may confirm World of Warcraft's perch atop the online gaming sector, one of the fastest-growing segments of the entertainment economy. World of Warcraft has been the first American video game to achieve truly global success. Most players pay around $15 a month for access to the game, which means it is on pace to take in more than $1 billion in subscription revenue this year. Online games like World of Warcraft are regularly updated by their makers through software upgrades known as patches. But the Burning Crusade is World of Warcraft's first full expansion, which must be purchased at retail (for $40). Players who do not upgrade can continue to play the game, but will not have access to the new features included in Burning Crusade.  SETH SCHIESEL  ",

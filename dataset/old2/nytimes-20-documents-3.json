            "text": "  It wasn't until the Hungarian photographer MARTIN MUNKACSI (1896-1963) turned his lens on fashion models that he made his fortune. But he established his reputation with reportage, much of it published in German photo weeklies. Now the International Center of Photography is mounting an exhibition of his work. The show, ''Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!,'' organized by F. C. Gundlach at the Haus der Photographie in Hamburg, includes more than 125 vintage photographs, along with magazines and page layouts. Mr. Munkacsi's images of models running on the beach revolutionized fashion photography by being natural rather than posed. Friday through April 29, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, icp.org.  It was the photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson who arguably put Mr. Munkacsi on the map, so taken was he with Mr. Munkacsi's photo ''Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika,'' taken in 1929 or 1930. Cartier-Bresson said of the picture, ''I suddenly understood that photography can fix eternity in a moment.'' It seems appropriate, then, that the International Center of Photography is simultaneously featuring an exhibition of Cartier-Bresson's work, which also starts Friday. Called ''HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON'S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,'' the show includes 251 prints personally selected and printed by the photographer. The show was originally assembled by the Museum of Modern Art as a memorial when Cartier-Bresson was presumed dead after having been held in German prisoner-of-war camps during World War II. (He actually escaped the camps and died in 2004 at 95.)  The WINTER ANTIQUES SHOW returns to the Seventh Regiment Armory on Friday with a core of 28 specialists in American antiques and art, including Shaker, folk art, American Indian, Colonial, Federal, Arts and Crafts, and Aesthetic Movement pieces. The show also features exhibitors showing British, European and Asian antiques, from old master paintings to Chinese export porcelain. Through Jan. 28, noon to 8 p.m. (to 6 p.m. on Jan 21, 25 and 28; to 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 20), Park Avenue at 67th Street, winterantiquesshow.com; $20.  ",

The lozenge-shaped Boheme, below left, was based on a hand-painted design from the 1970s. To create the new pattern, Ms. Taylor ''straightened the lines,'' she said, ''so it would repeat more easily.'' Midsummer, a delicate leaf pattern created in 2000, left, was merely simplified. ''It had been more mottled, more painterly, more textured,'' she said. The collection includes six other patterns.

            "text": "  Although it has been a decade since the Museum of Modern Art's giant Jasper Johns retrospective, there have been a spate of smaller shows devoted to aspects of his work. Now the National Gallery of Art in Washington has put its own spin on his oeuvre with ''JASPER JOHNS: AN ALLEGORY OF PAINTING, 1955-1965,'' which opens today.  Not wanting it to seem like either another retrospective or a survey show, Jeffrey Weiss, the gallery's curator of modern and contemporary art, has traced this artist's work through four motifs: the target, the mechanical device, the stenciled naming of colors and the imprint of the body.  Included in the show will be 84 works from public and private collections, including the largest group of target paintings ever assembled. Among them is ''Target With Plaster Casts'' (1955), which is the image on the cover of the show's catalog. It has been lent by David Geffen, the entertainment mogul. Also on view will be many of Mr. Johns's most famous works, like ''False Start'' (1959), which now belongs to the Chicago collector Kenneth C. Griffin, and ''Jubilee'' (1960). Through April 29; nga.gov.  An exhibition devoted to another popular American artist, ROBERT GOBER, opens Saturday at two of the Matthew Marks Galleries in Chelsea. Like Mr. Johns, Mr. Gober is known for using familiar vernacular American forms in his work.  Consisting of only new works -- two sculptures and several drawings -- the exhibition will feature a sculpture of a plastic milk crate filled with sculptures of Granny Smith apples that rests on a cast of a wooden footstool in the space at 526 West 22nd Street. A block away, at 521 West 21st Street, will be a second cast of a wooden footstool, this one made with an old packing blanket folded on the seat. Through March 10; (212) 243-0200.  ",

            "text": "  The comprehensive retrospective of paintings by Colin Campbell Cooper at the Heckscher Museum of Art is anchored at both ends by distinguished paintings. At one end of the museum is ''Broad Street Ca\u00f1on, New York'' (1904), a skyscraper scene that made the artist's reputation; at the other end is the dreamy, atmospheric ''Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco'' (1916), a high point in the movement now known as California Impressionism.  These paintings, which could hardly be more different in terms of style, subject matter and palette, provide an apt metaphor for the artist's career, which can be divided into two distinct phases. The first consists of his New York and East Coast city skyscraper scenes, for which he is remembered and to which he would constantly return throughout his career. The second phase involves more rural, nostalgic and exotic scenery, mostly painted in California. This show affords an opportunity to compare these two largely distinct bodies of art.  Organized by the curators William H. Gerdts and Deborah Epstein Solon for the Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach, Calif., ''East Coast/West Coast and Beyond: Colin Campbell Cooper, American Impressionist'' brings together about 70 of the artist's paintings, gathered from museums and private collections all over the country. (The show travels to Laguna Beach after it closes here.) Together these works form a portrait of a successful, peripatetic artist, one who accumulated extensive honors and critical acclaim during his lifetime but who since has largely fallen into obscurity. The show suggests the reason for that: While individual pictures are wonderful, taken as a whole his work is less than compelling.  Born in Philadelphia, Cooper (1858-1937) was a student of Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Later, in Paris, he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian, where he studied with William Bouguereau, Jules-Joseph Lefebvre and Henri Lucien Doucet. It was also in Paris that he developed an interest in architecture, beginning with paintings of medieval architectural monuments, especially the great Gothic cathedrals. Though trained as a figurative painter, he would prefer the subject of architecture throughout his career.  Cooper exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1890, returning to America the following year. He continued to paint and travel widely, like other American artists of his generation, spending summers in Europe and winters back home working in his studio. Dordrecht, in the Netherlands, became one of his favored stomping grounds, and was the subject of several paintings from the mid- to late 1890s. Among them is ''Dordrecht Harbor'' (circa 1898), the most vibrant and accomplished of his early European scenes. He also painted in England, producing at least one masterpiece of atmosphere and light, ''Wells Cathedral'' (circa 1902).  Cooper's interest in historic European architecture led him, beginning around 1903, to take up painting the theme with which his art and reputation have largely become associated: towering buildings and the smoky skyline of the new American skyscraper city. It was epitomized by New York, though this was not the only modern city that he painted. Showing here is a fine pair of views of Philadelphia, the artist focusing on architectural structures like the curved glass and iron shed built over Broad Street Station.  In many ways, Cooper's modern city and skyscraper paintings reflect the mood of optimism and ambition that pervaded American society in this period. More prosaically, they also capture the changing face of American cities, the artist picturing landmark structures as they are being built or when newly constructed -- for instance, the distinctive, domed 47-story Singer Building (1908) in New York, which is the centerpiece of his panoramic ''Mountains of Manhattan'' (circa 1903). At the time, this was the tallest building in the world.  Though Cooper made a specialty of this theme, he was neither the first nor the only artist to paint the modern American city. New York street scenes and modern urban architecture attracted the attention of many artists, among them Childe Hassam (1859-1935), the American Impressionist painter with whom Cooper is most often compared. With the exception of Hassam's famous flag series (1916-1919), his New York street scenes date primarily from the early to mid-1890s, thus predating Cooper's by almost a decade. They are also better painted.  In the exhibition catalog, the curators make much of the fact that Hassam preferred to paint more intimate urban views, whereas Cooper concentrated on buildings and the majestic skyline. This is true, but it is not to say that Hassam did not also paint these things, as shown by his ''Lower Manhattan (View Down Broad Street)'' (1907), recently on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a retrospective of his work. It is painted from almost exactly the same place as Cooper's ''Broad Street Ca\u00f1on, New York'' and another, similar picture, ''The Financial District'' (circa 1908). Yet Hassam's painting is far superior.  Whereas Hassam's painting is tighter and more focused, the artist using scale, composition and light to create a sense of spatial compression to convey a dark canyon between buildings, Cooper includes too much open sky at top, while also widening the foreground roadway to a point where the viewer's eye nearly drifts out of the bottom of the painting. The two artists are not in the same league. Perhaps this is why, despite the rising interest in American Impressionism starting in the 1960s, Cooper's work has largely been ignored.

            "text": "  For centuries, kimonos were decorated with patterns using paper stencils called katagami, made from three layers of rice paper and treated with persimmon juice. The technique is now a dying art, but Hiromi Ishii, an artist in Tokyo, has found a way to resurrect the one-of-a-kind stencils -- as paper lanterns.  Mr. Ishii takes stencils dating from the late 19th century to the 1940s, backs them with new rice paper and attaches them to iron frames wired to hold 25-watt bulbs. The katagami lights are manufactured in two shapes: rectangular and cylindrical. The rectangular lanterns come in 18-inch and 24-inch versions (the smaller, below, is $1,300), and the cylindrical ones are 18 inches high (above, $1,300). Prices range from $1,300 to $1,500.

            "text": "  The Winter Antiques Show, which opens today at the Seventh Regiment Armory, may have dozens of booths. But some monumental examples of decorative arts can be found only in New York galleries with special exhibitions coinciding with the show.  Helen Costantino Fioratti, for example, has cleared out much of her gallery, L'Antiquaire and the Connoisseur at 36 East 73rd Street, to show more than 50 European mirrors made in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. They include a huge 17th-century mirror from Naples, Italy, with a stunning silver frame, an 18th-century Venetian looking glass with blue glass borders, a few splendid over-mantel mirrors and a pair of Italian mirrors whose carved and gilded frames are confections of interlocking scrolls and leafy garlands. All retain their original glass, making them far more valuable.  Mrs. Fioratti has covered her walls with the mirrors, displaying them side by side and one above another, in imitation of the 16th-century vogue for lining rooms in mirrors. In the catalog for her show she writes that this style was popularized by Catherine de' Medici (1519-1589), who had 119 Venetian mirrors inserted into the paneling of her Paris apartment. The Italian-born Catherine was a great patron of the arts, inventing the high heel for her marriage to the French king Henri II, and later setting new standards for sumptuousness as ruling queen after the king's death in 1559.  In the following century mirrored rooms became the rage in France. In the catalog Mrs. Fioratti quotes an anonymous contemporary writer who attended a ball given by the Archbishop of Sens in 1651 and noted that ''50 of the richest and most beautiful Venetian mirrors served as delightful pictures displaying the faces, the experiences and poses, the smiles, the graces, the charms, the hands and arms of all the fine company.''  In 1678 Louis XIV commissioned the mirrored gallery now known as the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. By day the room's 306 panes of mirrors facing the windows reflected sunlight and the view of the park. By night the mirrors doubled the illuminating power of candlelight.  Louis XIV was also responsible for an obscure art form known as ''Bagard de Nancy,'' after C\u00e9sar Bagard, a 17th-century sculptor living in Nancy, France. To finance his constant wars, Louis XIV ordered that the silver and gold in his realm, including his own, be melted down. As substitutes, craftsmen began to carve wooden mirror frames, boxes and candlesticks in the style of the gold and silver originals. They used a type of cherry called Bois de Saint Lucie, which is extinct, but Mrs. Fioratti has a few rare survivors of the form, including a densely carved dressing table box, a mirror frame of carved foliage and a pair of featherweight candlesticks.  Most of the mirrors are Italian, many from Venice, an early glassmaking center. The oldest, from Tuscany, circa 1580, is in the shape of a Palladian door, about 20 inches high, with yellow marble columns on the sides and a broken-pediment cornice. The ebony frame has insets of pink, green and yellow marble. Gilt bronze statues adorn the cornice.  Another small Italian mirror, only 131/2 inches tall, is rarer. It was made in Rome in the mid-17th century. Its octagonal ebony frame is covered by pieces of jasper, lapis lazuli and other hard stones.  The seamless joining together of pietra dura (literally, hard stones) was a technique perfected in Italy in the 16th century, and it was a way to embellish many types of furnishings, from table tops to mirrors. ''It could take 40 years to make one table top,'' Mrs. Fioratti said.  In the catalog she writes: ''The technique proclaimed the owner's nobility and his collecting acumen. The harder the stone, the more difficult it was to cut, the higher the prestige associated with the work.''  (Coincidentally, in its Continental furniture sale on Wednesday, Doyle New York is auctioning a pair of 19th-century gilded neoclassical tables with pietra dura tops boasting dozens of specimen marbles. The presale viewing begins tomorrow.)  Mrs. Fioratti also has a 35-inch-high Dutch mirror etched with a large galleon under full sail, from about 1780. The etching was done by a wheel, which requires enormous patience and skill. ''The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has similar pieces, but its mirrors are all fitted into furniture or boxes,'' she said.  Some say that mirrors replaced tapestries as favorite wall decorations in European palaces in the 17th century, but the Franses Gallery, at 132 East 61st Street, has a show that challenges that view. ''Chinoiserie: European Tapestry and Needlework, 1680-1780'' has several wall-size tapestries that would enhance any palace d\u00e9cor, then or now.  China ''was a distant and exotic land, a place of fantasy, unlikely ever to be visited but brought more vividly into the imagination by travel books and a flood of imported porcelain, lacquer screens and other wares,'' David Franses, one of the owners, writes in the catalog. The designs for European chinoiserie tapestries ''depicted or imitated life in the Orient from a Western viewpoint.''  The most enchanting are two 12-foot-high Beauvais tapestries that survive from a series, ''The Story of the Emperor of China,'' that was originally created for Louis XIV in the 1680s. (They were the earliest examples of European chinoiserie.) In the first, priced at $1.2 million, a bejeweled (and European-looking) empress sits on a carved and gilded (again, Western-style) armchair in a seaside pavilion watching as the emperor departs in a sailing boat filled with pink-cheeked oarsmen. What makes it ''Chinese''? The porcelain is blue and white, and a seven-story pagoda is seen on a distant shore.  The second, called ''The Astronomers,'' shows men grouped around a globe. The standing figure is thought to represent the emperor. A seated figure with a drawing compass is said to be the Rev. Johann Schall von Bell (1592-1666), a German Jesuit priest welcomed at the Qing court for his knowledge of astronomy. To the side, one man peers through a telescope while another stands beneath an armillary sphere.  ''The telescope, celestial globe and armillary sphere depicted still survive at the Old Imperial Observatory in Beijing,'' said Simon Franses, a third-generation member of the family that founded the London gallery in 1909. What is Chinese here? A dragon, more pagodas and the emperor's long, droopy mustache. Don't miss the chance to see these enchanting fantasies.  ANTIQUES  ",

            "text": "  Skoto Gallery  529 West 20th Street, Chelsea  Through Jan. 27  As one of New York's very few full-time commercial spaces devoted mainly to contemporary African art, Skoto Gallery is worth keeping an eye on. Its present show is a strong solo by the Congolese-born artist Aime Mpane, who divides his time between Kinshasa and Brussels.  Skoto's front gallery is given over to large sculptural installations that address Western pillaging of Africa, military and cultural, that gained full force in the late 19th century and continues. In one piece a tiny sculptural figure of a European soldier casts a huge drawn shadow on the gallery wall. In another, shown at the 2006 Dakar Biennial, the life-size figure of an African man, made entirely from matchsticks, stares at a grave marked 1885, the year Africa was definitively carved up and distributed among several European nations.  Even with colonialism ended, the mining of African culture continues, as suggested in a third sculpture, of the German artist and self-declared shaman Joseph Beuys kissing African feet. Some of the continuing effects of a disastrous past are evident in dozens of small paintings hung salon-style in the gallery's back room, all done during one of Mr. Mpane's recent stays in Kinshasa.  Most were painted at night by firelight or candlelight in a city short of electricity. (Mr. Mpane could fully see the paintings only hours after they were done, in daylight.) They are images made, like the whole show, of shadow and light, and they are extraordinary.  HOLLAND COTTER  ART IN REVIEW  ",

            "text": "  Matthew Marks Gallery  522 and 526 West 22nd Street; 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea  All through Jan. 27  There is a great candor to Ellsworth Kelly's art, and always has been, as you can see in what amounts to a small survey of early and recent work at Matthew Marks's various Chelsea galleries. The largest, on West 22nd Street, has a half-dozen of the artist's new abstract relief paintings, made of superimposed geometric panels. They're like altarpiece diptychs with subtly mismatched halves that stack rather than fold.  Each painting plays, in a straightforward way, with ideas that the artist, now 83, has been exploring for more than 60 years: the interrelationship, even interchangeability, of painting with sculpture; the creation of fictional objects in real space; the way abstraction can be its own kind of naturalism, intellectually demanding but utterly unesoteric, as plain and packed as a book.  Although Mr. Kelly's work is often associated with bright colors, these new pictures are in black and white. And that in itself has a long history in his career, as is demonstrated in a series of early works on paper in an adjoining gallery. Titled ''Drawings on a Bus -- Sketchbook 23, 1954,'' the series was done just after he had moved to New York, where he developed a form of abstraction inspired by the world around him.  The landmark painting ''Cit\u00e9'' (1951) is an example. It's like an image of light flickering on dark water, but translated into patterns of black-and-white bars. (The image is recaptured in a singe large print installed in Marks's window-only space on West 21st Street.)  ''Drawings on a Bus -- Sketchbook 23, 1954'' is what it says it is: a sequence of black ink sketches inspired by a changing shadow cast on a book the artist was reading on a bus ride. The main form starts as a small curve, then gradually swells; if you could look at the drawings flipbook-style, you'd see the black form expand to fill the white page. The sequence, drawn without guile or frills, is a record from nature and a fresh invention, from which the artist derived several black-and-white paintings.  There are more, unstacked double-panel pieces in the West 24th Street space. Here color returns, not quite bright, not quite subdued, complicated but not all that complicated -- monumental the way a tall open window, a mature rose bush or a Shaker dresser is monumental. They aren't.  HOLLAND COTTER  ART IN REVIEW  ",

            "text": "  For four decades, John Hechinger ran a hardware and home supplies chain founded by his father in 1911. In 1978, as part of an expansion, he moved the corporate headquarters to suburban Washington, D.C. Soon after, he began collecting art to humanize the somewhat sterile building. Believing in the relationship between the tools his company made and the work that artists produced, he hoped the art would inspire his workers.  Mr. Hechinger died in 2004, but the collection he established has continued to grow through acquisitions overseen by International Arts & Artists, a Washington-based traveling exhibition service that was given control of the collection after his death.  Touring nationally since 2001, ''Tools as Art: The Hechinger Collection'' has touched down at the Katonah Museum of Art, filling the museum's main exhibition galleries with 64 works by almost as many artists. It is surprisingly poetic, optimistic and intriguing.  Tools have a small but appreciable place in art history, mostly in the context of labor imagery. Prehistoric cave paintings in France and Spain have schematic diagrams of primitive implements, evidence of the first stirrings of human tool making, and scenes of peasants working the soil are found throughout ancient art. Farming returned as a popular theme in art, beginning with medieval paintings and prayer books, like the Book of Hours, and continuing on through the 19th century.  But it was not really until the 20th century that tools became the subject of artworks. As Sarah Tanguy, curator of the Hechinger collection, points out in the exhibition catalog, depicting tools became for artists a ''means to bridge the gap between art and life, and to address the shifting definition of perception.'' She is right, though it may also have had something to do with questioning the traditional artistic process as an act of creation, an act of making.  Art critics do not talk much about craftsmanship these days, preferring to dwell on ideas or the clever statements an artist seeks to convey. This is largely because of Marcel Duchamp, who was probably the first artist to make an artwork out of real tools. With his ready-mades, beginning in 1914-15, he claimed the right of anyone to become an artist by choosing an object and putting it in a gallery. Among his early ready-mades was a snow shovel.  Several artists in this exhibition share Duchamp's anarchic values, like Arman, the late French artist who made sculptures using mass-produced tools like wrenches, handsaws, pliers and paintbrushes. (He is also known for his public-destruction artworks, like dynamiting a sports car.) Shown here is ''Blue, Red, Brown'' (1988), something between a painting and a collage -- thick stripes of paint end in paintbrushes, stuck to the canvas.  Similarly, Tracy Heneberger uses hardware-store materials like hinges to concoct adorably original, elegantly constructed sculptures, and the Chicago-based, self-taught artist known only as Mr. Imagination makes shadowy, masklike portraits using paintbrushes and found materials. There is something very African about the paintbrush portraits, though the artist's sources of inspiration include Christianity, world affairs, politics and popular culture.  In addition to paintbrushes and hammers, saw blades are popular, both as subject and material for artists. Ken Butler and Donald Lipski employ saw blades in assemblage sculptures that tend toward minimalism. Several artists also use the blades as a painting surface, including Jacob J. Kass, Howard Finster, Lou Horner, Oleg Kudryashov, Rico Solinas, Wim Delvoye and John Schlesinger. Others make replicas of handsaws out of paper and wood.  Mr. Finster, who was born in Alabama in 1916 and died in 2001, was one of America's best-known folk artists. The exhibition catalog tells us that he experienced visions from an early age and was later to become a revivalist Baptist preacher. He ''heard the call'' to paint ''sacred art'' only in 1976, subsequently cranking out crudely evangelical paintings and sculptures, commonly linking words and images. Shown here is a painted Stanley handsaw from 1990, dealing with the history of tools.  There are also older, historical works of art, including a lush black-and-white photograph of a New York hardware store, a sign in the front window advertising a sale on tools. Berenice Abbott took the photograph in 1938 as part of a government-sponsored project to document the city and its inhabitants. It makes for a splendid period piece, the store's owner having lined the window and pavement outside the store with all manner of items and implements.  If Abbott sought to convey a wealth of detail about the subjects she documented, Walker Evans, her contemporary, was interested in economical, precise images that conveyed elegance, simplicity and restraint. So it is with ''Wrench'' (1955), part of a series of photographs titled ''Beauties of the Common Tool'' that was originally published in Fortune magazine. It is a chilly, no-fuss, front-on portrait, the tool stripped and reduced to its bare essentials.  Evans introduced this series of photographs on the beauties of the common tool to readers of Fortune with a brief essay, in which he stated what Mr. Hechinger seemed to know all along: ''Almost all basic small tools stand, aesthetically speaking, for elegance, candor and purity.''

            "text": "  Long viewed as the domain of grandmothers, needlework has undergone an image makeover in the last decade. Snowboarders, the old torchbearers of alt.culture, have embraced crocheting, making beanies to wear on the slopes; coffeehouses and subways are filled with fashion-conscious types busily knitting or doing needlepoint. And contemporary artists like Andrea Zittel, Lisa Anne Auerbach, Orly Genger and Jim Drain and the Forcefield collective have given crafts a coolly conceptual edge.  Time then for an exhibition celebrating the unfrumpiness of craft, and, sigh, what better institution than one that recently went through its own makeover, changing its name from the American Craft Museum to the sexier Museum of Arts & Design?  The sorry news is that, despite its title, ''Radical Lace & Subversive Knitting,'' with around 40 works by 27 artists, is not a benchmark for introducing such crafts' coolness or radicalism to a vast art audience. Rather than exploring transgressive takes on knitting, the exhibition, organized by David Revere McFadden, the museum's chief curator, devotes most of its space to art that mimics the look or logic of knitting and lace and translates it into different materials.  In an essay in the show's catalog, Mr. McFadden does invoke interactive performances held in abandoned warehouses and the London Underground and people who knit sweaters for ''oil-spill-damaged penguins to wear in Antarctica'' -- the kind of activities you might associate with radical or subversive practice.  But in choosing the work for the show, he cites somewhat dated textile and crafts-based artists like Sophie Taeuber, Sonia Delaunay, Judy Chicago and Magdalena Abakanowicz as his models.  Much of the art on view is in the large-scale, virtuosic craft vein. Henk Wolvers's flat sculptures created with porcelain slip, a form of liquid clay, borrow the tracery if not the actual patterns of lace. Piper Shepard's ''Lace Meander'' is a series of hanging muslin scrolls into which the artist cut lace patterns with an X-Acto knife. Bennett Battaile's delicate sculpture of thin glass rods and Barbara Zucker's rubber sculptures both invoke lace-tracery in heavier materials.  Some of the artists address ''issues of politics, gender and ethics,'' as a wall text puts it, in a general way. Janet Echelman's giant, hand-knotted nylon net hanging from the ceiling in the museum's entryway recreates the look of a nuclear mushroom cloud. Freddie Robins's sinister-looking gray-knit bodysuit, with the words ''Craft Kills'' emblazoned across the chest, alludes to the airline ban on knitting needles in the post-9/11 era.  The works most in keeping with the show's politically charged title are more interactive and collective, or more related to performance. For example, Cat Mazza's collectively crocheted ''Nike Blanket Petition,'' a campaign against sweatshop practices represented here in a series of photographs, will be sent to Nike's corporate headquarters.  A video of Dave Cole's ''Knitting Machine'' project shows two John Deere excavators wielding telephone poles tapered to look like knitting needles -- and missiles -- to knit a giant American flag in the courtyard of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, Mass.  Sabrina Gschwandtner, an artist and founder of KnitKnit magazine, has set up a ''Wartime Knitting Circle'' surrounded by panels made of industrially knitted photos of Vietnam War protesters knitting, British women knitting woolen covers for World War II hand grenades, soldiers knitting during World War I.  She invites people to join her in knitting ''blankets for recovery'' for people in Afghanistan and troops convalescing in military hospitals, among other projects. (On the exhibition's opening day, Ms. Gschwandtner was chatting and knitting with Phyllis Rodriguez, whose son died in the north tower of the World Trade Center on 9/11 and who has since befriended A\u00efcha el-Wafi, mother of Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent serving a life sentence after his conspiracy conviction in the 9/11 attacks.  Needlework indeed has a radical past. William Morris, a mainstay of the Royal School of Needlework and the Arts and Crafts movement in England, protested late-19th-century industrial production. Feminist art in the 1970s drew heavily on so-called women's work, and Rosemarie Trockel's ''knitting pictures'' of the 1980s cleverly drew on political themes.  So many more artists might have been included whose work explores the social aspects of knitting and lace or who more radically recast these forms: Simon Perotin, of the punk-doily creations; the artisans in the Church of Craft; Ms. Zittel; Ms. Auerbach;, Mr. Drain; and so on.  Given the show's title, some visitors will arrive wanting to know how needlework, which runs counter to our technology- and information-saturated age, has become such a cultural juggernaut, and how it might serve to break down the barriers between artist and amateur, art and craft. A few works here may well satisfy that desire. Most will not.  Stitch Hunts  ''Radical Lace & Subversive Knitting'' runs through June 17 at the Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 8 p.m. on Thursdays); closed on holidays. Admission: $9; $7 for students and 65+; and pay-what-you-wish on Thursdays after 6 p.m. Information: (212) 956-3535; madmuseum.org.  A series of public programs related to the exhibition is planned, including lectures, panel discussions, performance pieces and workshops in knitting, lace-making, crocheting, fabric-making, fabric-printing and digital design. Some events are free with museum admission; others require an additional fee that includes admission.  Beginning tomorrow and running every Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m. through June 3 will be ''Well Crafted Weekends: Inter-Generational Workshops,'' for those 6 and older; $7 per person or per family (up to four people).

            "text": "  Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue3  PaceWildenstein  545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea  Through Feb. 3  Buddhist temple interiors in rural Japan have low, flat ceilings and clear, wide floors. They are horizontal, twilightish, untheatrical spaces, and pulse-slowing. They make you want to sit down. They are also almost the only architecture I know that looks the way silence sounds.  I'm not strictly comparing ''Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue3,'' Robert Irwin's installation at PaceWildenstein, to Buddhist architecture. That would be too easy, and inaccurate. The true point of reference is Western and modern, specifically abstract geometric painting. In a past installation Mr. Irwin paid homage to one perceptual magician, Joseph Albers; now he makes a bow to another, Barnett Newman, turning Newman's 1966-70 paintings ''Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue'' into a self-reflective architecture.  Three large aluminum panels are suspended low and horizontally from the gallery's ceiling, each painted in lacquerlike acrylic with one of the three primary colors. An identical panel has been placed on the floor directly below each panel. Because the paint is shiny and slick, it reflects whatever is around it: the figures of visitors, the gallery and illumination from an overhead skylight.  The panels also reflect one another. Look at a ceiling panel and you see the corresponding floor panel reflected, not as a smooth surface, but as a dark pool. Look at a floor panel, and the panel above leads out into dark space.  Optical illusionism of this kind has long been Mr. Irwin's calling card, but here he achieves it by bare-bones means: no stagy scrims, just the material that Newman himself used to create his own pioneering version of installation art: paint.  Yet just as Newman balked at the idea of having his largest painting series, ''The Stations of the Cross,'' installed as a wraparound chapel, he would have resisted the notion that Mr. Irwin's paean to him -- and to paint, and to light -- was a temple, which it isn't. It's more like a country teahouse, companionable, dimly lighted, very quiet even when busy, offering spirit-soothing visual fare in an overstimulated world.  HOLLAND COTTER  ",

            "text": "  Rather than drifting through another big, bland blockbuster this week, why not focus on small shows? You can still see ''ART OF THE LEGA: MEANING AND METAPHOR IN CENTRAL AFRICA'' at AXA Gallery through Jan. 14. Lega men and women, from Congo, enter an initiation society at an early age to learn life skills and gain wisdom, and most Lega art is created as an instrument of moral teaching. The process of growth is complex and stimulating, on the evidence of the elegant sculptures and haunting masks here. 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 554-4818.  With a little traveling, you can piece together a mini-retrospective of the contemporary artist ELLSWORTH KELLY. In Chelsea all of Matthew Marks's galleries (at 522 West 22nd Street, 523 West 24th Street, 521 West 21st Street and 526 West 22nd Street) are devoted to him: two spaces with new abstract relief paintings, another with a single panoramic print, and yet another with a terrific series of shadow-derived notebook drawings from the 1950s that have much to say about the way this artist has related abstraction and the world. They are all on view through Jan. 27 (matthewmarks.com). Through February, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (philamuseum.org) has its own Kelly festival, notable for landmark pieces from his formative years in Paris.  Speaking of small surveys, one of the best, and most moving, shows of political art around is at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (through Feb. 25). ''DISSENT!'' brings together familiar pieces and rarely seen work. If all you know about Sister Corita (1918-86) is big strokes of abstract paint, check out the visually passionate topical prints here. Most interesting, though, are the relics of political activism at Harvard itself: a T-shirt with a raised-fist emblem was hand-printed in 1969 during a campus strike by design students. They worked around the clock, printing a political message on any object brought to them, for free. (617) 495-9400 or www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/fogg.  ",

            "text": "  All collection shows are idiosyncratic. No random sampling of a museum's basement storage racks, with many categories of art to choose from and uneven levels of quality and significance, can be fully comprehensive.  The collection of 20th-century painting and drawing at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford is better than most, for this is America's oldest public art museum. And from its storage vaults comes ''Picasso to Pop: Aspects of Modern Art,'' an exhibition mapping the museum's history of acquiring works of 20th-century art. Approximately 60 rarely exhibited works are featured.  As in most collection shows, the positioning of the artworks is not strictly chronological, and it is not really arranged by themes, at least not any that might easily be determined by the casual visitor. It merely invites us to look, feel, mutter over and enjoy. No frills, no fuss.  Of course, the downside of this kind of display is that the pictures are largely wrenched out of context, lacking any sense of a unified purpose. Though it is wonderful to see artworks rarely put on display, context is vital when trying to determine art's meaning and significance. It enables comparisons, and the illustration of connections to supposed forebears in art.  The opening room samples different strains of modernism -- Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism and Surrealism, among others -- but it is by no means a survey. In the space of one wall we jump from Picasso to Fernand L\u00e9ger, to Wyndham Lewis to Egon Schiele and Otto Dix. The idea, as I understand it, is to illustrate how Cubism spawned various painterly trends in early modern art.  Though the painting by Mr. Lewis is valuable and important, there are actually few great works of art here. The Atheneum's best early moderns are already on display in the Avery Court, an area devoted to the permanent collection immediately outside the galleries, where you find famous paintings by Dal\u00ed, Mir\u00f3, Mondrian, Tanguy, Picasso and others. The nearby presence of these masterworks makes those in the exhibition look worse than they are.  What this new show does offer, however, is a chance to spend time with first-rate works by lesser artists, among them three little-known female Surrealists: Stella Snead, Kay Sage and Leonor Fini.  Born in Argentina and raised in Italy, Ms. Fini (1908-1996) has a sensuous self-portrait on display. She depicts herself as slim, with intense ''cat-like eyes,'' as a wall label notes, wearing a festive costume.  Ms. Snead (1910-2006), who was British, studied painting in London before moving to New York in 1939. The following year she traveled across the United States by bus. Ms. Snead, a vegetarian, was fascinated by the Southwest, where she returned in the early 1940s and began to paint dreamy landscape scenes with animals. ''Ecstatic Cow'' (1943) depicts a happy cow in a farmyard scene.  The second room of the exhibition introduces us to talented, if little remembered, modern Latin American painters, among them Carlos M\u00e9rida, Jes\u00fas Guerrero Galv\u00e1n and Mario Carreno. The most striking work of this group is ''La Vigornia'' (The Little Nurse) (1937) by Mr. Galv\u00e1n (1910-1973), a Mexican artist, which shows a girl holding a child. This was one of two modern Mexican paintings that the Atheneum's former director, A. Everett Austin Jr., bought on a visit to Mexico in 1939. The other was by Diego Rivera.  From here the selection narrows, focusing chiefly on American postwar artists beginning with representative abstract paintings by Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman and Robert Motherwell. None of them are terribly good, with the exception of the Pollock, ''Number 9'' (1949), which was a gift to the museum in the late 1960s by the abstract sculptor Tony Smith, who had his first retrospective at the Atheneum in 1967 and subsequently donated to the museum several works of his artist friends.  The final room is devoted to Pop art, specifically by the American painters Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Wayne Thiebaud. Mr. Rauschenberg's ''Retroactive I'' (1964) is a famous, important painting, but one that is frequently on show in the permanent collection rooms here. Less known, or shown, are some of Mr. Lichtenstein's screenprints on a variety of plastic surfaces.  The curators have chosen to close the show with a painted aluminum silhouette by Alex Katz titled ''Margie'' (1971), commissioned by the Atheneum board of trustees in honor of Margarie Ellis, who worked as registrar at the museum for 54 years before retiring in 1973.  It is a touching if kitschy tribute. At one time or another, almost all the artworks in this exhibition passed through Ms. Ellis's hands.

            "text": "  Pavel Zoubok Gallery  533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea  Through Feb. 3  Although known for a collage-a-day habit that began in 1964 and continued to the end of the millennium, John Evans has made paintings intermittently since his days as a student at the Art Institute of Chicago. This mini-survey of collages made from 1974 to 1987, all in the month of January, receives unexpected backup from five small, square canvases made in 1970, as well as a sixth, with color, from 1967.  The black-and-white works are especially noteworthy. Painted on raw canvas entirely in black that is modulated into an impressive range of dark grays, they resemble velvety charcoal drawings, but their compositions are barbed. Their claustrophobic patchworks of patterns and textures may bring to mind the flattened compositions of artists like Joseph Yoakum, Roger Brown and William Copley.  They mix the geometric and the abstract with suggestions of cartoons, wood grain, textiles, caning and shag carpet. Other motifs include part of a swastika (in ''Swastika Rising'') and a striped coffin (in ''Smogscape''). Part of their force comes from the way they suggest details of something much larger. They presage much about the recomplication of form that was to strike painting in the 1970s and should be included in the definitive history of the subject.  ROBERTA SMITH  ",

            "text": "  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901) possessed a magical talent for drawing. Encouraged by his friends and family, he studied portrait and religious painting in Paris in the 1880s before dedicating himself to a life of profligacy and becoming a habitu\u00e9 of Parisian bars, cabarets, cafes and brothels. Famously, this world became the subject of his most brilliant posters, drawings, lithographs and paintings.  But there was another side to Toulouse-Lautrec's art, one that the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum seeks to show in ''Toulouse-Lautrec and the French Imprint: Fin-de-Si\u00e8cle Posters in Paris, Brussels and Barcelona.'' The artist was a pioneer of modern advertising imagery. From the late 1880s on, he produced a series of innovative, monumental mass-market lithographic posters advertising more prosaic themes -- serial novels, magazines, books, products and even the Ault & Wiborg Company, makers of fine inks, based in Cincinnati.  Although the inspiration for these posters was purely commercial, they nonetheless possessed lasting artistic value. Successive rooms of this sprawling, eye-caressing exhibition reveal that the stylistic innovations of Toulouse-Lautrec's poster designs from the 1880s to 1900 influenced myriad modernist artists, first in Paris, then later in other parts of Europe. His embrace of lithographic printing and the mass-produced poster also helped elevate these lowly popular-art forms to the realm of high art.  The show of more than 130 French, Spanish and Belgian posters is arranged thematically, beginning with a small display devoted to lithography in the 19th century. Lithography is the simplest of the printed arts, the artist drawing with a greasy crayon or ink onto a limestone printing stone or plate, resulting in prints that replicate the hand-drawn lines and gestures. The technique was invented by the German playwright Alois Senefelder in 1798, though it soon gained popularity with artists for use in book and magazine illustration and was later adapted for commercial purposes.  Jules Cheret was among the first artists to treat lithography as a fine art medium, incorporating attractive colors into his images beginning in the late 1870s. He also introduced a new artistry to the designs, as witnessed by several posters here. Among them is a pair depicting dancing revelers, acrobats and musicians for the Folies Berg\u00e8re, the popular Parisian music hall catering to lewd and exotic tastes. It was the venue, in 1926, for Josephine Baker's famous ''banana dance,'' in which she performed topless wearing a skirt made of bananas.  By 1884, Cheret had designed almost 1,000 commercial posters, and, according to the exhibition catalog, ''was printing nearly 200,000 impressions annually.'' Following the 1881 ''revocation of censorship laws on printed materials,'' these color lithographic posters appeared on walls of buildings and kiosks throughout Paris, promoting theater, dance halls and music halls, as well as a new abundance of mass-produced consumer goods. They were intended to be catchy and instantly legible to potential consumers, hence their colorful intensity and bold graphic quality.  The following section of the exhibition presents a selection of lithographic advertising posters by various artists, among them Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis, Edouard Vuillard, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Alphonse Mucha and Jacques Villon, the elder brother of Marcel Duchamp. There are posters for gasoline, automobiles, magazines, journals, plays, arts expositions, housewares, sardines and all kinds of beverages, from wine and aperitifs to Champagne.  Many of these early posters employ imagery of flirtatious young women; even the gasoline poster features imagery of floating naked nymphs. It makes sense, for the figures in these posters are the personification of the desirable young woman for male audiences, the dominant consumers of the period. Even then, associating products with objects of male desire was a strategy to create desire for the product as well.  More generally, the posters are characterized by great artistic experimentation. Avant-garde modern artists delighted in the new art form, introducing an array of colors and subjects and playing with all kinds of dynamic designs. A good example is a Bonnard lithograph advertising Champagne, in which a young, frolicsome female, perhaps tipsy, is suddenly engulfed by a wave of Champagne bubbles spilling from her overfilled glass.  Toulouse-Lautrec was, however, the most innovative of the poster designers, with his Japonisme-inspired compositions (characterized by simplified figures and forms, planes of flat pure color and jolting diagonal lines), and his emphasis on subjects that had previously fallen outside the purview of fine art. There are more than a dozen of his posters here, including many famous ones of cabaret and circus performers, in addition to his more commercial work; among them are images of the dancers Jane Avril, May Milton and La Goulue, the stage name of Louise Weber.  The new, dynamic aesthetic of poster design occurring in Paris spread to other European cities, as the final two rooms of the exhibition seek to show. On display are several dozen examples of Belgian and Spanish modern posters, some from the collection of the Zimmerli, the rest on loan from private collections in Europe and the United States, many of them never before shown publicly. They add up to one more reason to visit this show, which is pure eye candy.

            "text": "  National Academy Museum  1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street  Through Sunday  Think of the National Academy Museum, for the next few days, as a walk-in china and curio cabinet where you can see and buy anything from a sedate little 17th-century English stoneware teapot to a new, and naughty, faience vase by the German potter Hinrich Kr\u00f6ger. The museum, whose intimate town house spaces make it a perfect showcase for pottery, porcelain, glass and enamels, is the site of the New York Ceramics Fair, now in its eighth season and an important participant in Winter Antiques Week.  This year the fair presents 40 dealers from the United States and abroad, including a handful who are potters themselves. Many dealers specialize, like Janice Paull, whose stock of English ironstone china (1790-1850) includes an unusual ''fire surround,'' made to edge a fireplace, in deep blue decorated with a gold floral-and-leaf pattern.  On the other hand, there is Leo Kaplan, whose inclusive spread covers a variety of European objects, among them Wedgwood portrait medallions; turn-of-the-century cameo-cut glass vessels by Thomas Webb & Sons; and a faience Columbine cat and a Harlequin dog (1880-1890) by the French designer \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9.  Chinese objects from various dynasties, most made for export, come in all shapes and sizes. At Cohen & Cohen is a rare pair of tureens and covers strikingly glazed in deep turquoise and modeled in the form of shells, from the Kangxi period (around 1720). Imperial Oriental Art shows a small but lovely pair of rectangular jardini\u00e8res and stands, their white surfaces patterned with intricate rose-colored floral abstractions, from the Qianlong period (1736-95).  A smallish but fierce Chinese tiger of porcelain (around 1820), whose yellow and black stripes are set off by beady green eyes, sits guard at James M. Labaugh Antiques. And flowery Chinese plates are much in evidence, including a pair of 18th-century dishes with convex centers for holding rosewater -- perhaps used as fingerbowls -- at Earle D. Vandekar of Knightsbridge.  Americana is by no means neglected. At the Stradlings, one wonderfully odd object is a primitive-looking, face-shaped pocket or saddlebag flask (about 1830), stained brown with iron oxide and crudely incised with lines suggesting hair. William R. & Teresa F. Kurau are showing two rare serving platters in deep blue Staffordshire (1825-1835) from a series depicting American cities, in this case Sandusky, Ohio, and Detroit.  And on the light side, Michelle Erickson, a present-day ceramicist, has satirical fun with ''St. George and the Dragon,'' a tableau depicting a monkey who stands atop a donkey, thrusting his lance at the Statue of Liberty, who lies at his feet, as a morose vulture looks on.  Mention must be made of the superlative group of high-end enameled tchotchkes at John Jaffa Antiques -- The Antique Enamel Company: perfume bottles, snuff boxes, toys, Faberg\u00e9 items, even a completely furnished sewing box. And the awesome display of flamboyant pieces at Nicolaus Boston Antiques gives majolica a new dimension.  GRACE GLUECK  Hours: Today and tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $15. Information: (212) 289-0496.  ART IN REVIEW  ",

            "text": "  Who but the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1930-92) could turn the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer from a figure of pathos into a witty incarnation of worldly wisdom? His satirical take on the dour 1514 drawing by D\u00fcrer is but one of the quirky, provocative, funny and sometimes gorgeous things to be found in ''One of a Kind: The Studio Craft Movement,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Studio craft refers to the post-World War II development of artist-craftspeople who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them. Ruth Duckworth, Wharton Esherick, Sheila Hicks, Harvey K. Littleton, Sam Maloof, Ron Nagle, Magdalene Odundo, Albert Paley, Ken Price and Peter Voulkos are among those whose work appears here. The show, the first in some time of the Met's periodic contemporary design exhibitions devoted to the studio crafts movement, is intended to reveal the breadth of the museum's collection in the field.  Jane Adlin, associate curator in the Met's 19th-century, modern and contemporary art department, has chosen about 50 pieces of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber from the museum's collection, which includes Mr. Arneson's 1979 bust of glazed earthenware, ''Mother D\u00fcrer.'' It presents D\u00fcrer's mother as a sharp-nosed, world-weary German frau looking wryly out at life from under a decorous wimple.  Mr. Arneson is not the show's only humorist. John Cederquist, who has his way with wood, weighs in with ''Little Wave'' (1990-91), an elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it. The wave is a sendup of the one familiar from Hokusai's ''Thirty-Six Views of Mt. Fuji.'' Richard Marquis's ''American Acid Capsule With Cloth Container'' (1969-70), a blown-up, capsule-style pill made from red, white and blue leftovers at a Murano glass factory, plays sardonically off Vietnam-era political issues like free speech, flag burning and antiwar protests.  While gravitating toward abstract and sculptural art, the studio craft movement has developed ways of working with nontraditional methods and materials, including some once available only for factory use. Electroforming, for example, an industrial process that deposits metals on other materials by means of a solution that conducts electricity, is now used in studio settings to produce effects not always achievable by traditional means. Michael Glancy's ''Melding Impetus'' (1994), for example, uses this process to fuse copper and gold leaf with blown and industrial plate glass, creating a free-form pattern of gold and copper on an elegant vase of pinkish and colorless transparency, as well as the two pieces of plate glass it sits on.  Glass is one of the most interesting and versatile materials in contemporary studio crafts. Its use has been much extended since Mr. Littleton, a founder of the studio glass movement, began in the early 1960s to explore the possibilities of hot glassmaking in a studio rather than a factory. He is represented here by ''Amber Crested Form'' (1976), created by placing a big blob of hot, transparent glass on an assemblage that included a hollow tube. He used gravity and the tension created by cooling glass to manipulate the piece into a dolphinlike shape.  On a quite different wavelength is ''Suspended Artifact'' (1993), another glass work by a younger practitioner, William Morris. Known for his series of glass art shaped like bones and other artifacts, Mr. Morris here has vertically pinioned a tusk-shaped piece of glass to a glass vessel, using a glass rod that runs through both the tusk and the vessel's handles. Black silhouetted figures, presumably inspired by prehistoric wall drawings, appear on the vessel's sides. It's a studio production that almost looks like an ancient artifact.  The show also includes tapestries with new and clever variations on an ancient form. Inspired by the sight of snow piled high on the roofs of houses in Normandy, Ms. Hicks's ''Linen Lean-To'' (1967-68) is a wall hanging in bold relief, in which overlapping thick tassels made from bleached linen thread create the effect of a thick carpet of the white stuff.  Olga de Amaral's ''Umbra 30'' (2003) combines linen with silver leaf and paint in a woven wall of deep blue and silver strips that evoke the rivers and waterfalls of her native Colombia. And in Jon Eric Riis's ''Kiss the Prince,'' a fetching bolero-style jacket woven of silk and metallic threads is patterned with circles of varying sizes made of tiny seed pearl and coral beads. Against this background large green frogs appear, swimming vainly toward the neck of the garment, which may have been designed for a princess.  Joan Livingstone's ''Spine'' (1995), another three-dimensional fiber piece, is composed of handmade felt stiffened with resin and sewn with suture thread. Knotted and pulled lengthwise, the piece (it is hung horizontally) could almost be taken for a tense human backbone, albeit one on steroids.  Traditionalists have their place in this show as well. Esherick (1887-1970), a studio craft pioneer, is represented by ''Music Stand'' (1962), an elegantly simple frame of cherry wood crossbars supported on three curving legs. Mr. Maloof's ''Settee #3/87'' (1987), in richly grained tiger maple and ebony, has a classic plain shape, with slight tweaking of the double chair as stripped down by Shaker furnituremakers.  The master of metal work, Mr. Paley, appears here in top form with ''Push Plate'' (1981), a dashing Belle \u00c9poque-style revolving door attachment in cast bronze, part of an elaborate design for the interior of a Southern restaurant.  Attention must also be paid to the seemingly old-fashioned work of Bonnie Seeman, whose dainty ceramic ''Coffeepot and Tray'' (2003), with its mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks, evokes the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china. Its shape also suggests the head, shoulders and bodice of a neatly dressed Victorian lady. But with a closer look the vegetation can be read as human tissue, with the rhubarb stalks cut to resemble spongy bone ends and seeds evoking red blood cells, giving it a modern touch of the macabre.  All told, this comes off as one of the liveliest shows of this field that the Met has put up in recent years.  ''One of a Kind: The Studio Craft Movement'' continues through Sept. 3 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949 or metmuseum.org.  ART REVIEW  ",

            "text": "  The Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London is not known for displaying feisty contemporary art, which is what makes ''femme brut(e), its big fall show of artworks by women, so surprising. Given that this sort of thing is so rarely on display at the museum, it was even more surprising to discover that some of the art comes from the museum's own collection. This is a terrific show, perhaps one of the best to be staged at the museum in some time.  Nancy Stula, the curator, has assembled an engaging selection of early, confrontational feminist work with more recent, varied offerings by female artists. The contrasts of tone and subject matter between the two groups, spilling across two levels of the building, help illustrate just how far female artists have come.  The title of the exhibition suggests the idea of women who are raw, tough or brutal. But it is more of a metaphor than anything else, characterizing artists who -- one way or another -- have sought to challenge the historically marginalized position of women. ''With the youngest of the artists in this exhibition born in 1959,'' Sherry Buckberrough, an art historian, writes in the show's catalog, ''all came of age while the status of women in the art world was still strongly contested.''  The early years of feminism saw female artists embrace numerous strategies to combat art world sexism and discrimination. One popular approach was to reclaim women's creative histories by adopting materials and art-making practices once commonly, and pejoratively, associated with femininity -- needlework, weaving, pottery, printmaking, to name a few. Among the many artists who took up this challenge was Miriam Schapiro, represented here by an ebullient circular collage that draws on patterning and textile traditions.  The design of Ms. Schapiro's concentric, centralizing composition alludes to women's genitals, which points to another visual strategy adopted by female artists: an empowering use of sexual imagery and depictions of the female body. Before the early 20th century, women were largely excluded from art academies, and even when they were allowed in, they weren't allowed to study nude models. Men, in this way, maintained a virtual monopoly on their depiction.  Caricature and satire were also important tools for early feminist artists. May Stevens's ''Study for print 'Big Daddy' '' (1969) is an early drawing for her ''Big Daddy'' series of paintings depicting a thick-necked nude man with a slobbering bulldog sitting on his lap. The figure, whom the artist called ''big daddy,'' is a cartoonlike personification of male authority and of United States militarism during the Vietnam War era; the paintings are some of the most famous works of early American feminist art.  The tradition of feminist satire is carried on in the work of Alison Saar, who is represented by a color woodcut, ''Sweeping Beauty'' (1997), depicting an upside-down image of a naked woman with hair like a broom head. It is a caricature of the domestic chores commonly ascribed to women, with the figure mirroring the crucified Christ in religious paintings.  Artists like Nancy Spero, Lynda Benglis and June Wayne, who were involved in the feminist art movement from its early days, also have work exhibited here, but it concerns other issues. Ms. Wayne, a master printmaker, is represented in the show by some ''exploratory images of interstellar space,'' as Ms. Buckberrough writes in the catalog, but which are really formal explorations of the printmaking medium.  Angry social and political protests about gender are largely a thing of the past. The new wave of female artists are working on issues and concerns similar to those of their male counterparts. Among them is Ellen Carey, a photographer who creates startling abstract colored Polaroid images using random developing emulsion flows. The images depart from standard photographic traditions in much the same way that the work of her feminist predecessors departed from art history.

            "text": "  A Trove of Americana, Filled With Heart, Goes on the Block  There are many ways to collect American antiques, and those ways come into focus every January as collectors, curators and dealers flood into New York for the Winter Antiques Show, the American Antiques Show, the Stella Americana at the Piers show and auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's.  There is the slow and meticulous collecting model, exemplified by Bertram K. and Nina Fletcher Little, a Massachusetts couple who researched every piece of Americana they bought over a 60-year period, beginning in 1928. They published more than 150 scholarly articles and several exhibition catalogs before they both died in 1993.  And then there is the relatively quick and intense collecting model, which Mark and Susan Laracy, a Connecticut couple, followed as they formed a collection in 25 years. They are selling 225 pieces of American antique furniture and folk art at Sotheby's on Jan. 20.  After buying their first antique in 1982 from the veteran Stonington, Conn., dealer Marguerite Riordan at the Winter Antiques Show, the Laracys plunged into the Americana world with unfettered enthusiasm. Every year they attended the Americana auctions in Portsmouth, N.H., visited the Skinner sales in Boston and scoured the antiques fairs and auction houses in New York.  Now they are selling everything in a single-owner sale that is expected to bring $3 million to $6 million. It includes folk art portraits by John Brewster Jr., Sheldon Peck, Sturtevant J. Hamblen and Ammi Phillips, as well as New England highboys, chairs, chests and desks. One standout is a Queen Anne mahogany desk and bookcase with original finials, brass hardware and pad feet that was made in the Connecticut River Valley in the late 1700s.  Why was Americana so appealing to the Laracys? ''When you are 40, you want to convey an image of stability and having had ancestors, even if you come from nowhere,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''Americana provides that.'' A former perfume executive, Mr. Laracy established his company, Parfums de Coeur, when he was 40; sales of its inexpensive versions of popular designer fragrances are now $100 million a year.  After that first purchase at the Winter Antiques Show, the Laracys began collecting Americana seriously under the guidance of Mrs. Riordan. ''She controlled our brains for 10 years,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''If we were attracted to a piece for aesthetic reasons, she made sure there were no condition issues, that the piece was unique and retained its original color.''  Several important works came through Mrs. Riordan, from small sculptures to needlepoint samplers to major Queen Anne Connecticut case pieces: a cherry bonnet-top high chest, a small cherry dressing table, a cherry blanket chest and a maple tavern table.  Equally important are four portraits by Brewster, the itinerant deaf painter. Mrs. Riordan negotiated the acquisition of a pair of large Brewster portraits depicting Maj. Daniel Coffin and his wife, Elizabeth Stone Coffin, of Newburyport, Mass. She persuaded Eddy G. Nicholson, a New Hampshire investor and part owner of the Congoleum Corporation, to sell them to the Laracys.  ''We never did meet Eddy Nicholson, but I can tell you it took two years to agree on a price with him,'' Mr. Laracy said. Sotheby's estimate for the pair is $150,000 to $300,000.  Mrs. Riordan also sold the Laracys a smaller-scale pair of Brewster portraits, of a brother and sister. They show a sensitivity to children and are similar in feeling to the children's portraits in the current Brewster show at the American Folk Art Museum, which closes on Sunday.  The sale is also noteworthy for its wealth of little objects: a whalebone knitting basket, a carved slate plaque with a couple dressed in Indian attire, an engraved and scrimshawed whale ivory watch stand and a Windsor cradle.  ''I love smalls,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''They have a tactile quality.''  Elisabeth Donaghy Garrett, an Americana expert, author and educator, noted another characteristic of the collection: charm.  ''It is an exceptional collection in terms of provenance, outstanding form, condition, outline and color,'' she said, ''but the theme that popped out at me is love, or affection, which comes through pictorially. There are pieces with hearts and courting couples on textiles and plaques. There's a playfulness that carries through.''  One hooked rug shows 34 children jumping rope, skating, fishing and dancing around a maypole, with a banner reading ''Children will play, four seasons round.''  Collectors of Americana typically focus on either furniture or folk art, but the Laracys collected both. The sale includes a group of 19 blue-decorated salt-glazed stoneware vessels, a weather vane, whimsical andirons and a bird cage in addition to all the antique furniture.  ''Our approach was to focus on the finest examples we could find across a number of categories,'' Mr. Laracy said.  Provenance seems to have been particularly important to the Laracys, who organized the lots in the catalog by provenance.  Apart from Eddy Nicholson's portraits, there are several pieces formerly owned by the Littles, including a magnificent Hamblen folk art portrait of a girl in a white dress that is estimated at $100,000 to $300,000. Other pieces were once owned by such serious collectors as Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Paul and Margaret Weld, Virginia Ramsey-Pope Cave, Burton and Helaine Fendelman and John Howland Ricketson III.  The Laracys are selling their Georgian colonial house in New Canaan, Conn., and moving into Manhattan. They now plan to collect contemporary art and 20th-century modern furniture: ''a mix of American, Italian and French,'' Mr. Laracy said.  ''We are changing our lives,'' he added.  The presale viewing begins next weekend, on Jan. 13. On the morning of Jan. 18 Sotheby's Institute of Art is to hold a private tour of the collection and a symposium with Ms. Garrett; Paul S. D'Ambrosio, director of the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y.; and Thomas P. and Alice K. Kugelman, authors of a definitive study on Connecticut River Valley furniture.

            "text": "  A favorite sport in today's bloated art world is to lament the surfeit of commercial galleries, biennials and art fairs, which have replaced the ''genuine'' art experience provided by nonprofit organizations. But as Matthew Higgs, director of White Columns, the city's oldest alternative art space, recently pointed out in Artforum, the nonprofit scene in New York is thriving.  Mr. Higgs's examples -- Artists Space, the Kitchen, Printed Matter -- fall mostly within Chelsea and Lower Manhattan. To his list you might add the Longwood Arts Project in the Bronx. Founded in 1981 by the Bronx Council on the Arts, the project has welcomed residents including Ernesto Pujol, Pep\u00f3n Osorio and Tim Rollins & Kids of Survival (K.O.S.). Longwood also maintains, perhaps more than any other alternative art space in the city, a tangible relationship with its surroundings.  ''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary'' at the project's gallery space consists of three installations put together by former Longwood directors: Fred Wilson, Betti-Sue Hertz and Eddie Torres.  Longwood's position as an art world entity and part of the South Bronx cultural landscape is immediately apparent in Ms. Hertz's installation, ''Street Disturbance.'' Excerpts from William Pope.L's ''Black Factory'' project include a vitrine of objects like a James Brown doll and a melted hair pick labeled as if it were crime-scene evidence and a video in which Mr. Pope.L enlisted masked participants to approach people at a fair in Maine and ask them about race.  Included in this section are the Surveillance Camera Players, who use similar agitprop tactics in their videos, posing masked in front of surveillance cameras holding signs reading ''1984'' or ''Big Brother.'' Etc\u00e9tera, an Argentine collective, videotapes its performances, which look like soccer rallies but involve pointing out the homes of suspected torturers during the ''Dirty War,'' the deadly civil conflict that took place in Argentina from 1976 to 1983.  ''Iconoclasm,'' organized by Mr. Torres, takes a lighter approach, simply celebrating the Bronx's cultural diversity. Dylan Mortimer's ''Prayer Booth,'' a copy of an aluminum phone booth outfitted with a pull-down knee rest, and his ''Portable Kneeler'' with red and yellow construction-site graphics, are similarly playful -- paying homage to, and spoofing, the religious art of this heavily Hispanic and Roman Catholic borough.  A wall hung salon-style with paintings, drawings and photographs continues Mr. Torres's Bronx-centric view of art and culture. Some of the lopsided portraits found here look frankly amateurish, like the paintings found in thrift stores. But there are also Olga Kitt's canny rendering of ''Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' as a Graffiti'' and her Picasso redux, ''Demoiselles Da Bronx.'' A video of the drag queen Princess Xtravaganza performing and Sally DeJesus' remake of the board game Monopoly with South Bronx streets add to this roundup of local-inflected art.  The tightest installation in the show, ''Black Now,'' is the work of Longwood's first director, Mr. Wilson. An artist known for his critiques of institutions and of accepted versions of history, he treats ''Black Now'' as a curatorial outing and an unannounced exhibition of items from his own collection. Interspersed among works by Kara Walker, Kalup Linzy and Rashawn Griffin are vitrines filled with objects -- everything from black ceramic panthers and dark-skinned Nativity figures to black light bulbs, Black perfume by Kenneth Cole and black pasta (squid-ink pasta).  Walls are lined with T-shirts for bands like Black Flag and Black Maria, and a grid of wall-mounted DVD boxes features titles like ''Black Hawk Down,'' ''Black Orpheus,'' ''Black Beauty'' and ''Men in Black.''  Mr. Wilson's own contribution pretty much steals the show in this installation, although Carl Pope's letterpress posters, filled with proclamations like ''Black makes me feel thin'' and ''Black is Beauty, Pride, Power. Black is Me!,'' reveal a similar semantic intelligence.  Longwood's mission, to nurture unknown talent, especially ''underrepresented groups such as people of color and women,'' can feel at times like revisiting the early '90s, when identity politics were as much a genre of contemporary art as portraiture or landscape painting were in the 19th century. Today, when the trend is toward emerging artists from around the globe, Longwood feels even more anchored in its neighborhood.  ''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary'' continues through March 10 at Longwood Art Gallery, Hostos Community College, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx; (718) 518-6728 or longwoodcyber.org.  ART REVIEW  Correction:  January 9, 2007, Tuesday  An art review on Thursday about the exhibition ''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary,'' at Hostos Community College in the Bronx, omitted a curator. The wall of art hung salon-style was organized by Edwin Ramoran under the title ''Everyday Is Like Sunday''; it is not part of ''Iconoclasm,'' organized by Eddie Torres and hanging in the same room.  A picture caption with the review misstated the given name of a former director of the Longwood Arts Project who is also one of the curators of the show. As noted in the review, he is Fred Wilson, not Frank.  ",

            "text": "  Neo-Splendor In American Wing  As the Metropolitan Museum nears the spring opening of its ambitious new Greek and Roman galleries, a more modest project is quietly taking shape on the opposite side of the museum, in its American Wing. The first phase -- the new neo-Classical galleries of American art on the wing's first floor -- opens Tuesday.  ''We've been in this building for more than 25 years, so it's been a full generation,'' said Morrison Heckscher, chairman of the Met's American Wing. ''Now it's time to rethink, upgrade and improve the facilities and the way we show the collection.''  One of the most drastic changes, which has yet to be installed, will be a large glass elevator. In addition the entire layout of the wing has been rethought, better to show off the collections, which include the famed period rooms spanning two centuries. An 18th-century room in the Dutch tradition from the Winne House outside Albany will be added.  The Met's decorative arts collection will have a more extensive display, and the American paintings galleries will also be renovated, expanded and totally reordered on one level instead of two. Even the famed Charles Engelhard Court will be refurbished to give its sculpture, stained-glass windows and architectural elements greater prominence. The entire project is expected to be completed by 2010.  For now visitors will be able to see the neo-Classical galleries of American art from 1810 to 1840. The setting reflects American Classical architecture and includes details from Colonnade Row on Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan -- ''the grandest row houses of the period,'' Mr. Heckscher said.  For a Gift, Three's Company  Ten years ago the San Francisco collectors Richard and Pamela Kramlich established the New Art Trust, a nonprofit foundation to promote the collecting, care and exhibition of media art. It was started to help the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where the Kramlichs are trustees, but in 2002 it branched out to include the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate in London.  Now the couple have given the trust 21 works by artists including Bruce Nauman, Nam June Paik, Bill Viola, Matthew Barney and Doug Aitken, to be shared by the three museums.  ''The trust was set up early on with the understanding that the ownership of media art is very different from that of painting and sculptures,'' said Neal Benezra, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Museums won't be showing these works constantly, so sharing them makes sense.  ''It's also a way of creating an interesting new alliance between European, East Coast and West Coast institutions,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern in New York. ''This is a remarkable body of material that would have been impossible to have assembled today.''  Price and rarity have made such works particularly difficult to collect. Most important, said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, the sharing arrangement enables the works to go on public view far more than they would be otherwise. ''It gives the public more access,'' he said. ''From the point of view of the visitor, it doesn't make any difference who owns the works.''  A Russian Favorite  A portrait of a bohemian-looking man in a dark jacket and a bright red scarf by the Lithuanian-born Expressionist painter Chaim Soutine is the cover image of Sotheby's catalog for its Feb. 5 sale of Impressionist and modern art in London. The choice is fitting not because portraits have become particularly popular at auction, but because Russian collectors love Soutine and London is the place where many Russian billionaires live and where others go to shop.  ''Man With a Red Scarf'' (about 1921) is being sold by Dorothy Cherry. Her husband, Wendell Cherry, was the president and chief executive of Humana, the hospital management corporation based in Louisville, Ky. He died in 1991.  Ms. Cherry bought the Soutine 10 years ago at Christie's in London for $1.6 million, then a record for that artist. ''The art world thought I was nuts,'' she recalled. ''I never asked anyone's opinion. It was the greatest Soutine I'd ever seen for sale.'' Sotheby's now expects the painting to bring $5.9 million to $9.8 million.  Ms. Cherry said the strength of the art market, and particularly the Russian market, made her decide to sell. ''It just seemed like the right time,'' she said.  Both she and her husband sold paintings at Sotheby's over the years for high prices. In 1989, at another high point in the market, they sold ''Yo Picasso,'' the Blue Period self-portrait from 1901, for $47.9 million to the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos.  ''I hung the Soutine in the same place I hung 'Yo Picasso,' '' Ms. Cherry said, speaking of her house in Louisville. The similarities were striking: both were portraits of men with bright red scarves.  ''I think Soutine is underrated,'' she said. ''To me he's one of the great artists. I used to think he was the poor man's Picasso, but not anymore.''  Hello, Minneapolis  Peter Eleey, curator and producer for Creative Time in Manhattan, has been named a visual arts curator at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. He replaces Douglas Fogle, who left the Walker for the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. Mr. Eleey starts at the Walker in March.  Nato Thompson, a curator at Mass MoCA in North Adams, Mass., will replace him. Mr. Thompson will be joining Mark Beasley, who was an independent curator, writer and artist working in London before he joined Creative Time last month as a curator and producer.  Inside Art  ",

            "text": "  New Yorkers don't often meet up with tiles, outside subway stations or the shower. Tiles flourish, after all, at latitudes where palm trees grow and window shutters are needed to minimize abundant sunlight.  Valencia is just that sort of place. Perched on the Costa del Azahar of Spain, the orange blossom coast on the Mediterranean, the city started as a Roman military colony and was later conquered by the Visigoths. The legendary Castilian nobleman El Cid (a k a Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar) fought the Moors in Valencia in the 11th century. The city changed hands again in the 13th century, when the Aragons from the north took over.  This pileup of cultural influences can be detected early in ''Tile Design in Valencia: From the Middle Ages Through the Early 20th Century,'' a show at the Queen Sof\u00eda Spanish Institute in Manhattan. Organized by Dr. Jaume Coll Conesa, director of the Museo Nacional de Cer\u00e1mica y Artes Suntuarias Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00ed de Valencia, the exhibition features about 110 works drawn from Valencia museums. It moves at a swift clip through nearly eight centuries, demonstrating along the way the effects of Islam, Christianity and modernism on the ceramic tile tradition.  The earliest fragments, from the late 14th and early 15th centuries, grouped under the heading ''Mystic Geometry,'' exhibit the Muslim strain. The Spanish term for a glazed tile, azulejo, comes from the Arabic az-zulayj, ''little stone,'' and the use of math in the azulejos' arrangement and design is fitting, coming from the culture that invented algebra.  The Islamic influence is also evident in the subject matter. Sharia, or Muslim law, discouraged the representation of icons and images of the living, so intricate, often highly stylized abstract patterns were favored in the early tiles. One fragment, ''Olambrilla (insert tile) With Arabic Funerary Epitaph'' from the 1400s, features flowing Arabic text painted in blue against a white background.  Valencia was one of the most active Mediterranean ports in the 15th century, and its tiles were exported to places as far-flung as Egypt, Syria and Turkey. The biggest customer, however, was Italy, including the Vatican. Examples of Italian exports are in short supply here. Instead the exhibition focuses on a local 15th-century trend: the demand for tiles with heraldic crests, used to mark property. In addition to the usual roaring lions and cackling birds are intriguing tiles created for the Furriers Guild, featuring an instrument used for carding, and a tile showcasing the instrument of the Crossbowman's Guild.  Vibrant color arrived in the mid-16th century by way of Italy and the majolica ceramic tradition. By the 17th and 18th centuries Valencian craftsmen were producing elaborate, multitile scenarios featuring local martyrs, like ''Flagellation of St. Vincent Martyr,'' or large-scale compositions, like ''St. Joachim and the Virgin as a Child,'' or ''Holy Family'' from 1787, surrounded by a twisting vegetal border.  The show's largest work, which the catalog calls the most significant example of Valencian tile design in any museum, is a piece known as the Disdier Paving, from the Royal Family's Tile Factory of Valencia, made in 1808, the year Napoleon invaded Spain. It is a late Rococo fantasy of winged horses, charging knights and theatrical and mythical figures like Pan, Flora, Athena and Victory. Genre scenes featuring the culinary side of Valencia also flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. A wonderful panel of two bewigged figures, ''Serving Turr\u00f3n and Chocolate,'' from around 1775 (turr\u00f3n being the local nougat confection) has a duck dropping down from the sky to knock over a cup of chocolate.  The modern period rivaled the 14th and 15th centuries in importance for the tile industry in Valencia, partly because of demand for Spanish tiles in places like Southern California. Several early-20th-century examples reveal the rage for Art Nouveau, with its attenuated floral motifs.  A stylized frieze of flamingos appears in one work, while another, with a ''neo-Arab'' design, brings the Valencian ceramic tradition nearly full circle. Art Deco panels and geometric compositions from the 1930s predict the wild designs found in Latin America a few decades later. A panel with early versions of Mickey Mouse is a nice example of proto-Pop.  The exhibition ends abruptly in the '30s, when Valencia's tile industry fell victim to the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). The catalog, which includes fine reproductions and essays that dryly rehearse the opening and closing of Valencia's many factories, says only that businessmen were reluctant after the war to invest in technological improvements to revive the tile industry.  After all the space devoted to taxes and tariffs imposed by noblemen in earlier centuries, as well as to the arcane laws of tile production quotas, the catalog's omission of Generalissimo Franco, who ruled Spain until 1975, and his possible impact on the tile trade seems anticlimactic.  There is much to enjoy about ''Tile Design in Valencia,'' although it can feel at times like a walk through a tile showroom. A few photographs show works in what was probably their original positions, but over all the exhibition lacks the contextual material that would adequately describe how these fragments and panels looked and functioned in their intended applications.  ''Tile Design in Valencia'' also serves nicely as a brief analogue to the history of Western painting, running alongside the rise of the Baroque and Rococo, 19th-century genre painting and modernism, while demonstrating an early example of extreme multiculturalism with its Islamic, Christian and pagan strains. (Interlacing forms in the early tiles even resemble animal-style motifs from Ireland and Saxony, a similarity that perhaps creeps in as a result of the Visigoths.)  The difference between painting and tiles, of course, is functionality. Works here have served as everything from architectural decorations and floor coverings to funereal monuments, property markers and company advertisements. Despite the efforts of New York's craftsmen and designers, these tiles are considerably more artful than what can be found in the subway.  ''Tile Design in Valencia: From the Middle Ages Through the Early 20th Century'' continues through Feb. 1 at the Queen Sof\u00eda Spanish Institute, 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street; (212) 628-0420 or spanishinstitute.org.

            "text": "  IN 1925 Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez (1895-1963), the great self-taught draftsman, left his small ranch in the Jalisco region of Mexico for work in the promised land of the United States. He never returned to his wife and four children back home, spending more than three decades confined to psychiatric hospitals after being picked up off the streets of California in 1931: jobless, homeless, confused and unable to communicate in English.  But in the 300 drawings Mr. Ram\u00edrez created over the last 15 years of his life -- after being sent to DeWitt State Hospital near Sacramento with a diagnosis of catatonic schizophrenia -- he revisits the scenes of his young adulthood: the horse and rider, trains and tunnels, Madonnas, animals and landscape of his native Mexico.  ''He was a landscape artist obsessed with memory,'' said Brooke Davis Anderson, director and curator of the American Folk Art Museum's Contemporary Center. ''Mexico breathes in his work.''  ''Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez,'' opening Tuesday at the museum with 97 of these works (including the untitled one below), moves beyond the traditional view of Mr. Ram\u00edrez as a deaf and mute schizophrenic artist. It interprets his artistic merits by looking at the work as art shaped by poverty, immigration and institutionalization.  He was making art before his time at DeWitt; he decorated his letters home and made drawings at Stockton State Hospital, where he was first institutionalized. But there is no record that any of that work survived. He was never interviewed.  After his transfer to DeWitt in 1948, he met Tarmo Pasto, an artist and psychology professor at Sacramento State College, who began to collect Mr. Ram\u00edrez's drawings. Mr. Pasto introduced him to local artists and to some of his students, including the painter Wayne Thiebaud, who recalls having brief conversations in Spanish with Mr. Ram\u00edrez.  Mr. Pasto also arranged for Mr. Ram\u00edrez's work to be exhibited, which he was aware of from newspaper articles the hospital saved. Reviewing a group show at the de Young Museum, Alfred Frankenstein of The San Francisco Chronicle called Mr. Ram\u00edrez the ''most striking artist'' in the exhibition, one with ''an innate gift for form, color and pictorial organization'' whose art ''went deep into recollections of his country's folk art.''  But the glory that Mr. Ram\u00edrez may have longed for never arrived. In accordance with California laws protecting the privacy of mental patients, he could not be mentioned by name. Instead he was called simply, ''an aged Mexican.''  He fared no better in New York. In the 1950s, Mr. Pasto sent a tube holding 10 of Mr. Ram\u00edrez's drawings to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum for a show that never happened. They were put into storage. The museum now has the largest public cache of Mr. Ram\u00edrez's work -- though the drawings came to light only 40 years later when an intern stumbled upon them.

            "text": "  To take the fullest pleasure in the exhibition of sculptures and video by the Spanish artist Sergio Prego at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, you must stand perfectly still and quiet in front of ''Black Monday'' (2006), a single-channel video of still life photographs of controlled fireworks explosions taken inside an abandoned factory in Bilbao, Spain (above). In all, the artist took more than a thousand photographs of 17 different explosions with 40 cameras. He then scanned them into a computer, cropped them and ran them together. He also composed what he calls ''a sequencing of sounds,'' a series of repeating ambient electronic noises that serve as the soundtrack. The results are a multifaceted representation of something that is usually invisible to the eye: explosion clouds immobilized in time and space, forming immensely beautiful sculptural shapes. It brings out the inner pyro in all of us. Sometimes these clouds even resemble dancing figures. It is as if you were looking at a three-dimensional sculpture in video, though a few frames later, the form magically evaporates. The video lasts only three and a half minutes, which gives you just enough time to get hooked before it starts all over again. It is like stepping into another dimension.

            "text": "  Claude Monet will forever be known for his dreamy Impressionist canvases of grain stacks and cathedrals, the seaside and of course the famous water lilies and gardens that surrounded his beloved home in Giverny. Unlike Degas, C\u00e9zanne or Pissarro, contemporaries whose reputations rested on works on paper as well as canvases, Monet was the epitome of the plein-air painter.  Whenever a journalist or collector asked him how he worked, he talked incessantly about the liberating possibilities of painting outdoors, forgoing any mention of the sketches, pastels and prints he quietly produced throughout his life.  ''Monet wanted to present himself as the great painter of his day,'' said Richard Kendall, curator at large at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. ''It was a kind of PR exercise, a way of defining himself. But the big, teasing question has always been why didn't he want people to know he drew?''  Three years ago Mr. Kendall and James A. Ganz, the Clark's curator of prints, drawings and photographs, set out to answer that question. Their findings are the focus of ''The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings,'' an exhibition of about 100 works -- drawings, sketchbooks and prints, along with some related paintings -- that opens on March 17 at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and will arrive on June 24 at the Clark.  The curators say their exhibition will show that Monet wasn't the anti-draftsman he led the public to believe, and that he relied on drawing both to prepare for his paintings and as an independent form of expression.  He drew throughout his seven-decade career, filling pocket-size sketchbooks when he was a truculent teenager and executing pastel drawings of seascapes when he was in his 20s. He drew in different ways using different materials, and in his final years made abstract crayon and pencil drawings as studies for his water-lily paintings.  Although Monet helped perpetrate the myth that he did not, and maybe even could not, draw, nearly 500 of more than 2,500 works mentioned in his catalogue raisonn\u00e9 are sketchbooks, drawings and pastels. Yet, until now, few scholars have paid much attention to them.  They figure prominently in the fifth and final volume of the catalogue raisonn\u00e9, published by Daniel Wildenstein in 1991 and devoted primarily to works on paper. But when the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 was reprinted in 1996, that volume was dropped.  Mr. Ganz was unaware of just how little most scholars knew about Monet's drawings until he began researching a view of Rouen drawn in crayon in 1883 and owned by the Clark Institute. ''It was an object that caught my eye especially because I knew it was done after a painting,'' he said.  (He said the painting, which is in a private European collection, will be united with the drawing for the first time in the exhibition.)  The more he began to dig, Mr. Ganz said, the more strongly he felt that there was no substantive scholarly examination of Monet's drawings.  He approached Mr. Kendall about the possibility of jointly organizing a small show centering on the Clark's Rouen drawing. But after embarking on their research, they began to envision a far larger exhibition. ''We began asking colleagues about Monet's works on paper and consistently got the same reaction -- a blank stare,'' Mr. Ganz said.  After approaching MaryAnne Stevens, a Monet scholar at the Royal Academy, who agreed that the potential show could travel there, the two American curators set out to find as many of Monet's works on paper as they could. Searching in Japan as well as in Europe and the United States, they eventually came up with the nearly 100 works that will be in the show.  The Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet in Paris, which owns eight of Monet's mature sketchbooks, dating from the 1860s through the 1920s, proved a particularly useful source. A colleague there alerted them to the existence of an unpublished journal by Count Th\u00e9ophile B\u00e9guin Billecocq, a friend of the Monet family who was himself an amateur draftsman. The only known firsthand account of Monet's early life, it depicts him as a young man devoted to drawing. Written over roughly a 30-year period, starting in 1854, the journal has remained in the family, passing eventually to the count's great-grandson, Xavier B\u00e9guin Billecocq, a historian of the Persian Gulf region.  ''It became clear to us that we had stumbled on something quite critical,'' Mr. Ganz said of the manuscript. ''It gave us a wealth of information.''  Interspersed throughout the journal are observations about Monet. When the artist was 17, for instance, B\u00e9guin Billecocq described his rapid sketching technique as ''Impressionistic.''  Yet the drawings themselves, he wrote, were ''detailed, as precise as reality, and delicate, representing the houses, trees, people, etc., in the best possible manner.''  In a telephone interview, Xavier B\u00e9guin Billecocq said that Monet often drew in the countryside or at the sea while on vacation with the B\u00e9guin Billecocq family. ''They would go exploring the surrounding countryside, often sketching in the woods,'' Dr. B\u00e9guin Billecocq said. ''He drew in the country in places like Deauville and Honfleur.''  The journal also captures the flavor of Parisian life in an era when friends got together to play musical instruments, attend the opera and concerts and simply draw.  ''It gives a good description of the youth and social environment of Monet,'' Dr. B\u00e9guin Billecocq said. ''You see him growing up, needing money. My great-grandfather would help him, giving him money to buy paper and supplies.''  The early sketchbooks described in the journal are pencil studies of local architecture, trees, sailboats and pastoral scenes. ''His sketches, whether in crayon or pencil, were always excellent, even if they were rapidly executed,'' Th\u00e9ophile B\u00e9guin Billecocq wrote in his journal. ''He knew how to capture the essential characteristics of a scene.''  In another revelation he notes that around 1862, the year Monet turned 22, the artist decided to be known as Claude, his middle name, rather than Oscar, his first.  Drafted into the army and sent to Algiers, Monet had been teased by his regiment about the ''ridiculous'' name Oscar.  ''Goodbye Oscar, long live Claude,'' B\u00e9guin Billecocq writes facetiously. It explains why some of the early drawings are signed Oscar and later works Claude. (Monet signed only some of his works on paper.)  While the manuscript, titled ''Grand Journal,'' is too fragile to be in the exhibition, the curators say, quotations from it will be incorporated into the installation as a way of telling the story of the artist's life.  Still, questions about Monet's development remain. ''It's easy to separate the youthful work,'' said Mr. Kendall of the Clark. ''It is less distinctive and powerful.'' By the mid-1860s, he said, Monet was making ''brilliant'' drawings of the Normandy coast with a waxy black crayon. ''But we still don't know why he did them,'' Mr. Kendall said.  In the first Impressionist Exhibition in 1874 in Paris, however, Monet showed seven of his pastels, their research shows, but they were not included in the catalog or mentioned by any critics. ''It's one of the puzzles in Monet scholarship,'' Mr. Kendall said, adding that Monet ''takes it up again in the 1880s, and for two weeks in 1901 when he went to London and his canvases didn't arrive.''  He added, ''He wanted to work, so he made pastels of London bridges and rivers.''  Of 26 pastels that can be datedto that time, 6 will be in the exhibition, along with two paintings, of the Waterloo Bridge (1901) and Charing Cross Bridge (about 1900).  Like van Gogh, Monet also created works on paper based on actual paintings. ''He wasn't consistent, but had many different manners of drawing,'' Mr. Ganz said, adding: '' A lot had to do with his public-private issue. Some, that were sketchy, were meant only for his private use, while others, more in the style of his paintings, were finished works in themselves.''  Mr. Ganz said he thought the most surprising drawings were those related to the water-lily paintings. Minimalist in style and not pretty like the paintings themselves, these drawings, in black, white and violet crayon, can best be described as agitated, abstract and almost Expressionistic.  ''He never meant for the public to see them,'' Mr. Kendall said, adding: ''It all comes back to marketing. His public image was important to him, and drawings complicated that picture. In fact, they even contradicted it.''  ''The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings'' will be at the Royal Academy of Arts in London from March 17 to June 10, and at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., from June 24 to Sept. 16.

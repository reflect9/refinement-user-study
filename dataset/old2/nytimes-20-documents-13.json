Mr. Hughes continued his relationship with Ms. Wevill after Ms. Plath's suicide in 1963, but the two never married. The letters allow ''unprecedented access to Hughes's state of mind at a time of crisis in his personal and professional life,'' said a statement from Stephen Enniss, the director of Emory's Manuscript, Archives and Rare Book Library. The collection includes more than 60 letters from 1963 to 1969, sketches, diary entries and photographs. One letter implores Ms. Wevill to ''burn all my letters.'' A biography of Ms. Wevill, ''Lover of Unreason,'' by Yehuda Koren and Eilat Negev, was published in December.  JULIE BOSMAN  ",

            "text": "  Meryl Streep will take on the role of a mother with a rebel streak when she stars in the film version of the international hit musical ''Mamma Mia!,'' Reuters reported.  The film will be the first musical for Ms. Streep, who has, nevertheless, sung in the movies ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' ''Postcards From the Edge'' and ''Death Becomes Her.''  The story of ''Mamma Mia!'' features 22 Abba songs and revolves around a bride-to-be and her once-rebellious single mother, who reared her on a Greek island without disclosing the identity of her child's father. The young woman locates three possibilities and invites them to the wedding.  ",

            "text": "  To the Editor:  Brad Leithauser's review of Robert Fagles's new translation of the Aeneid (Dec. 17) flattens out the complexities of Virgil's epic. Leithauser suggests that the gods control the world of the Aeneid and that ''relatively little malice and unreasonableness and rapacity seem innate to our kind.'' Yet Virgil has one of his characters in Book 9 question whether his internal lust for war is prompted by the gods or whether people simply deify their own desires. Virgil's epic is full of these hints that Aeneas' god-given mission might be prompted by his own deified desires and that the epic gods are an allegorical, literary device. In addition, Leithauser states that ''Virgil was wrong'' to suggest that Rome's glory ''will never fade,'' but it's Virgil's characters who suggest this -- not Virgil. As Edward Rothstein put it in a recent New York Times column: ''The argument has been made that Virgil's project was actually ironic, anti-Augustan: he showed how civilization itself is drenched in blood, with self-celebratory history being written by the victors.''  Leah Kronenberg  New Brunswick, N.J.  The writer is assistant professor of classics, Rutgers University.  To the Editor:  ''Arms and the man I sing.'' Oops, or is it ''Wars and a man I sing''? Darn, or is it something or other else?  Why should one read Robert Fagles, or any other middleman, instead of actually reading Virgil? Why anything but ''Arma virumque cano''?  If one is too lazy to learn Latin, it is surely a waste of time to read Fagles under the illusion that one is reading Virgil. Try Shakespeare instead.  John Winkler  Arlington, Mass.  ",

Ms. Nilsson's death, which was not widely reported outside Sweden, was confirmed by Jon Asp, executive editor of the online publication Ingmar Bergman Face to Face. No cause was announced.  Ms. Nilsson was best known for her leading role in Mr. Bergman's 1951 film ''Summer Interlude.'' (Titled ''Sommarlek'' in Swedish, the film was sometimes known as ''Illicit Interlude'' in English.) She also collaborated with Mr. Bergman on ''Till Gl\u00e4dje'' (''To Joy,'' 1950) and ''Kvinnors V\u00e4ntan'' (''Secrets of Women'' or ''Waiting Women,'' 1952).  Maj-Britt Nilsson was born in Stockholm on Dec. 11, 1924, and trained at the drama school of the Royal Dramatic Theater there. In 1951 she married Per Gerhard, a theater director.

            "text": "  Everything went as planned for ''Dreamgirls,'' a perfectly confected Oscar machine. Great cast, showstoppers that stopped the show, and a wonderful back story in Jennifer Hudson, the washed-out ''American Idol'' turned movie star. And it was all propelled by hype-filled rollout, plenty of strong reviews and, finally, widespread belief that it was the favorite in the best-picture throwdown.  Everything continued to go as planned during the news conference at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences here on Tuesday morning, with this crowd-pleasing costume musical racking up eight nominations. And then the best-picture category was announced: ''Babel,'' ''The Departed,'' ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' ''The Queen'' and ''Letters From Iwo Jima.''  Wait. Are they nominating six this year? The hundreds of reporters in the auditorium were leaning heads together, making sure that they did not hear the name ''Dreamgirls.''  They did not.  ''Dreamgirls'' had the most nominations for the day, eight, including a pair for its supporting players, Eddie Murphy and Ms. Hudson, but it will not be around for the war. It is the first film in many decades to have the most nominations and not be in the best-picture category.  The seven nominations for ''Babel'' prove that the academy is a sucker for a weave of ambitious filmmaking (multiple languages and stories are represented) and big stars in small roles. (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were in just one segment of the movie's triptych.)  ''Pan's Labyrinth,'' a Spanish-language film, received a half-dozen nominations, as did ''The Queen,'' in an array that was announced by Sid Ganis, president of the academy, and the actress Salma Hayek at 5:38 a.m Pacific time; it was planned to land in the middle of morning shows in the East.  Much of what happened was expected -- Forest Whitaker and Helen Mirren, who played monarchs to very different effect -- continued their stately walk to the podium, with nominations for best actor and best actress. (''I'm not going to win in a million years, and that's absolutely fine,'' said Kate Winslet, a fellow nominee in the actress category.)  Ms. Mirren said of her nomination: ''It's the mother lode. It's the big mama of the whole thing. There's nothing in the whole world like the Oscars.''  Mr. Whitaker described his excitement: ''I'm stoked. I have to find the right word, and 'stoked' is O.K.,'' he said, joining the ritual outpouring of gratitude and expectation.  Mr. Murphy, a seasoned veteran, and Ms. Hudson, an absolute beginner, were joined in the supporting categories by 10-year-old Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin, 72, for their roles in ''Little Miss Sunshine.'' (It's been 38 years since Mr. Arkin's last nomination, for ''The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.'' )  The supporting-actor category was notable for its eclecticism, with Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of a pedophile in ''Little Children'' being recognized, as was Rinko Kikuchi's role in ''Babel'' as a deaf-mute Japanese girl with a lot on her mind. In total, out of 20 slots for acting awards, 5 black actors were nominated, 2 Latinas and a Japanese woman.  And in a year when the precursor awards have been all over the road, the movies came from all over the world. ''Cinema is an international art form, and you can do it in any language the artist dreams about,'' Mr. Ganis said after coming offstage. He pointed to Clint Eastwood's vivid example in making two movies in two languages about the same war.  The academy, frequently criticized for being a prisoner of convention, ventured far and wide in search of films that represented the year's most spectacular achievements. Tidy little movies like ''Little Miss Sunshine'' and ''The Queen'' were selected for best-picture nods, and two movies in which English is a second language -- ''Babel'' and ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' -- also made the cut, while ''The Departed,'' a big popcorn movie with a bloody, relentless end, was recognized as well.  Even ''United 93,'' a movie that made the unthinkable watchable, was given a significant nod when Paul Greengrass was nominated for best director. None of these movies had a built-in Oscar-winning apparatus -- far from it, actually, but perhaps that was precisely the point.  Los Angeles is a place that worships success, but can be very punishing when it comes to striving for it. Paramount/DreamWorks learned as much, as it sought to position ''Dreamgirls'' as a favorite and succeeded; but something went wrong on the way to the podium. It most likely did not help that the movie, with its gorgeous songs and amazing costumes, was a tough sell to begin with among white males, a demographic that describes the majority of the academy's 5,800 voting members.  The marketing of the film didn't help, either. Regardless of what you have heard, ''Dreamgirls'' was a story that was about something, a particularly American story of success and redemption. Instead it was sold as a parade float, majestic and unstoppable. Behind that miscalculation, the basic blocking and tackling of an Oscar campaign fell short. The decision to send out screeners of the movie late was built on hubris -- the same reason that Parmount/DreamWorks chose to charge $25 for early peeks at the movie -- which suggested that it was an Important Film that must be seen on a big screen.  But the death of President Gerald Ford, combined with a national holiday, meant that most academy members did not get the film until Jan. 3, 10 days after they had received ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' a movie that wasn't even supposed to come out in 2006. That means that academy members saw the hype long before they saw ''Dreamgirls'' and had just 10 days to see it before they voted. (''Flags of Our Fathers,'' another Paramount/Dreamworks project, this one from Mr. Eastwood and Steven Spielberg, came basted in Oscar juice and went nowhere.)  It made for a bad day at Paramount, although the studio's chief, Brad Grey, was traveling and not taking calls, so no one can say for sure. The studio can find solace in ''Babel,'' a movie from its specialty division, Paramount Vantage, that did extremely well on Tuesday.  At Warner Brothers, things did not go as planned, either. It was thought early on that ''Blood Diamond,'' with its serious themes and star wattage from Leonardo DiCaprio, would be a durable contender. Mr. DiCaprio scored a best-actor nomination. But it was Warner's ''Departed'' that landed in the thick of the best-picture race, and its director, a hardy unrequited perennial named Martin Scorsese, was also chosen. And the studio's decision to release Mr. Eastwood's ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' is looking pretty smart just about now.  Alan F. Horn, chief executive of Warner Brothers, said best-laid plans or not, he was thrilled for both directors, Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Eastwood -- the face-off will reprise 2005, when ''Million Dollar Baby'' edged out ''The Aviator'' -- and with the five nominations ''Blood Diamond'' received. (In one indication of ''The Departed's'' underlying strength going forward, Mark Wahlberg was nominated in the supporting category for his profane, explosive depiction of a police official.)  ''We ended up in a good place,'' Mr. Horn said.  Now that the nominations have been settled, the battle for credits will begin. The academy handout listed the best-picture nominations of both ''The Departed'' and ''Little Miss Sunshine'' with ''nominees to be determined.'' The academy will have to decide which of the five producers of ''Little Miss Sunshine'' deserve a statue, and although Graham King is currently listed, for the purposes of the best-picture nomination, as the sole producer of Warner Brothers' ''Departed,'' Mr. Grey, who packaged the movie as an agent before he came to Paramount, may yet have something to say about that. As murky as that seems, it can be said with certainty that it won't be pretty.  And, going forward, the best-picture race was left without a clear favorite, which is great news for the academy. The voters love a contest, and ABC does, too, because television of all kinds thrives on suspense. With a new host, Ellen DeGeneres, and a collection of films that millions of people actually paid money to see, ABC is hoping on reversing a drop-off in viewership and certainly improving on last year's 39 million viewers when the show comes up on Feb. 25.  The Oscar Nominees  Here are the nominees in major categories for the 79th Annual Academy Awards, which will be broadcast on Feb. 25 on ABC. A complete list is available at nytimes.com/film.

            "text": "  Perhaps it was inevitable that the first German-made film comedy about Hitler would get a mixed reception in Germany -- a country still haunted, six decades after the fall of the Third Reich, by the mystery of how this strange madman once held it in thrall.  What is more surprising and revealing, perhaps, is the nature of the critiques, which have lambasted the movie but not the idea that Hitler could be the subject of a comedy.  The advance buzz about ''Mein F\u00fchrer: The Truly Truest Truth About Adolf Hitler,'' which opens here Thursday, has been almost uniformly negative, with German critics and commentators proclaiming the film na\u00efve, bizarre, vulgar and -- most damning of all -- not funny.  ''One laughs about two and a half times during the film,'' Michael Althen, a critic for the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, wrote, comparing it unfavorably to classic Nazi satires like Charlie Chaplin's ''Great Dictator'' or Ernst Lubitsch's ''To Be or Not to Be.''  ''Most of the jokes are flat, harmless or stale, and what's particularly offensive is that Adolf Hitler, of all people, is given quite sympathetic character traits,'' wrote Harald Peters in Welt am Sonntag.  Even Helge Schneider, the madcap German comedian and actor who portrays Hitler, has distanced himself from the film, saying in a radio interview here: ''It didn't thrill me. I just don't find it funny.''  No doubt, some of the bad reaction is a matter of taste. ''Mein F\u00fchrer,'' directed by a Jewish filmmaker, depicts Hitler in scenes that could be drawn from a movie by the Farrelly brothers -- wetting his bed, playing with a toy battleship in the bath, padding around his office on all fours while barking like a dog and so on.  But the noisy national debate -- over what is by all accounts a flawed film that the public has not yet seen -- shows that Hitler remains an enduringly uncomfortable topic for many here.  ''As soon as you mention Hitler, the entire subject of German history comes up again,'' said Henryk M. Broder, a German Jewish journalist who gave ''Mein F\u00fchrer'' a mixed review in the magazine Der Spiegel. ''Like a congested toilet, everything that was flushed down comes back.''  Two years ago, Germans debated another Hitler movie, ''Der Untergang'' (''The Downfall''), asking if the filmmakers had broken an unwritten code by portraying Hitler as a human being, given to moments of tenderness, rather than just a monster. At issue now is whether Hitler should be a source of humor -- at least in a German-made film.  ''Hitler was not some poor soul; he was a fanatic and a mass murderer,'' said Lea Rosh, a publicist who lobbied for the construction of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin. ''One must show a little respect for his victims,'' said Ms. Rosh, who has not seen the film and said she had no plans to see it.  To some extent, the critical and commercial success of ''The Downfall'' helped settle the debate over Hitler's suitability as a subject in favor of the filmmakers. Ms. Rosh aside, few people here argue that Hitler is not fair game for a comedy -- any more than he was off limits for a melodrama about the last days of the Third Reich.  The trouble is, most critics say Germany's first stab at a humorous Hitler does not have enough laughs.  ''Mein F\u00fchrer'' opens in late 1944, with Hitler emotionally paralyzed, contemplating the ruin of Nazi Germany. His advisers, desperate to buck up their leader, recruit a fictional Jewish acting coach, Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum, to prep the F\u00fchrer for a New Year's Day speech aimed at rallying his people.  Gr\u00fcnbaum, whose assignment gives him and his family a temporary reprieve from a concentration camp, makes Hitler wear a mustard-yellow tracksuit and practice exercises, which include dropping to all fours and barking in the manner of his beloved Alsatian, Blondi.  Emotionally stunted, sexually inadequate (''I can't feel you, my F\u00fchrer,'' Eva Braun wails during a failed encounter), and psychologically scarred by an abusive father, Hitler ends up taking to the couch, in scenes that play like a particularly dark twist on a Woody Allen movie.  ''The more grotesque you get in treating this subject, the closer you get to artists who did it better,'' said Lutz Hachmeister, who recently made a documentary about Hitler's propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels.  Treating Hitler as a satirical subject worked for Chaplin, the critics here agree, but he was a cinematic genius. And Chaplin himself said in 1964 that he would not have been able to poke fun at the Nazi leader had he known in 1940 about the horrors of the Holocaust.  ''The Producers,'' a Mel Brooks musical farce about a Nazi-themed theater production, is not known to have been staged in Germany but the film version opened last spring to no particular controversy.  ''Mein F\u00fchrer'' was written and directed by Dani Levy, known for his 2004 film, ''Alles auf Zucker!'' (''Go for Zucker!'') That film also plowed new ground, with a comic look at two German Jewish brothers reunited after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Mr. Levy said he was resigned to the storm of criticism over ''Mein F\u00fchrer.'' ''This is not a consensus movie, I know that,'' he said, sitting in his sparsely furnished office here. ''In Germany, whenever you touch this subject, you're immediately at the edge of good taste.''  He noted, however, that the film had played well with preview audiences around the country, and Mr. Schneider, the film's star, said he had softened his criticism after seeing a final cut this week.  Yet even Mr. Levy had to accommodate the sensitivities of a German audience. ''Mein F\u00fchrer'' was originally told from the point of view of Hitler, who had survived the war and was plotting his return to power. That version deeply unsettled viewers at a test screening last summer.  So Mr. Levy re-edited the film to give Gr\u00fcnbaum, the Jewish acting coach, and his family a bigger role. They function as a sort of moral counterweight to the banality of Hitler and his henchmen.  ''It was always my intention that the movie be a tragedy and a comedy,'' Mr. Levy said. One of his inspirations was ''Life Is Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's bittersweet fable about life in a concentration camp.  Even here, though, Mr. Levy could not satisfy his critics. Mr. Broder, the journalist, who said the movie was not as bad as its reviews, nevertheless complained that the doomed nobility of Gr\u00fcnbaum and his family bogged down what could have been a hard-edged, unapologetic comedy about a nasty man.  But that would be a film, Mr. Broder acknowledged, for which Germans are not ready. ''Germans are embarrassed by Hitler,'' he said. ''Here is someone you wouldn't want to share a seat on a train with for half an hour, and yet he sat atop the German nation for 12 years.''  ",

            "text": "  As the 64th annual Golden Globes unfolded on Monday, ''Babel'' won the award for best dramatic movie. And Martin Scorsese won for directing ''The Departed,'' while ''Dreamgirls'' scooped up awards for best comedy/musical and for a pair of its actors -- keeping the films in tight competition for top honors in the Hollywood awards race.  In a rather remarkable feat, Helen Mirren won best actress awards for playing two Queen Elizabeths: one for the television mini-series ''Elizabeth I'' and the second for portraying Elizabeth II in the film ''The Queen.''  Still, the evening's real significance lay in the ritual: Hollywood's first big awards party of the year was under way.  No film truly dominated the affair. Jennifer Hudson, a newcomer, won for best supporting actress in a motion picture for playing a determined but less-than-svelte singer in ''Dreamgirls,'' while the longtime Hollywood star Eddie Murphy -- himself a newcomer to awards glory -- won best supporting actor as a singer on the decline.  Dozens of television and movie stars braving unusually chilly temperatures made their way along 30,000 square feet of red carpet, the longest such artifact in the awards world, and were greeted by approximately 1,500 credentialed journalists, who could well have matched the number of guests at the event.  Mr. Murphy's and Ms. Hudson's wins gave early moments of triumph to ''Dreamgirls'' in a season in which no single film has dominated audience interest, or critical enthusiasm.  Bursting into tears, Ms. Hudson, who first gained notice on ''American Idol'' and had her first screen role in this film, told the audience filled with Hollywood's top movie and television stars: ''You don't know how much this does for my confidence. Because of this, it makes me feel like I'm part of a community, it makes me feel like an actress, and you don't understand how much that feels good today.'' Afterwards, Ms. Hudson dedicated her award to Florence Ballard, one of the original Supremes, ''a lady who never got a fair chance.''  Speaking to reporters after receiving his award, Mr. Murphy, whose career has seen a jagged series of highs and lows, said that, much like older women, actors of color can also find it difficult to land choice roles. ''Hey, I'm a minority, too,'' he said. ''It's tough to be a black person in this town as well.''  Forest Whitaker was named best actor in a dramatic movie for his portrayal of Idi Amin in ''The Last King of Scotland.''  And as she won best actress in a comedy or musical for ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' one somewhat older woman, Meryl Streep, rocked the gathering when she donned a pair of reading glasses and declared, ''I think I've worked with everybody in the room.'' She paused. ''Yes, I have,'' she concluded.  She won for playing an entertainingly monstrous fashion editor savaging her assistants, played by Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt. Ms. Blunt won her own Golden Globe, for best actress in a television mini-series, for ''Gideon's Daughter.''  The best foreign language film prize went to ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' an unusual twist, in that the movie, with dialogue in Japanese, was directed by Clint Eastwood. Backstage, Mr. Eastwood, positively ebullient, told the press that he might make a Hungarian or Lithuanian movie next. When he was asked to pose with a statue, he said, \"You want me to do my Paris Hilton.\"  The Globes are voted on by the 80 or so members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. By contrast, the Oscars are voted on by the nearly 6,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Throughout the night, those who made or starred in the dozens of contending movies and programs looked for any edge from the event.  Mr. Scorsese is now firmly a contender for this year's Academy Awards; he has never received that honor, despite repeated nominations.  Graham King, a producer of ''The Departed,'' said shortly before the show began: ''Of course I care. I didn't care yesterday. But now I care a lot. We're under a microscope right now, and the whole world is watching. A win would be nice.''  Sacha Baron Cohen was named best actor in a musical or comedy for his performance in ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.''  The box-office performance of the contenders for best dramatic picture was certainly uneven. ''Babel,'' which had the most Globe nominations, seven, has taken in only $21 million in this country. This multi-character drama about cultural misunderstanding across the globe, directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, vied for best picture in the drama category with Martin Scorsese's ''Departed,'' which had six nominations. That film, a bloody Irish mob drama with a scene-chewing performance by Jack Nicholson and a cast of younger stars, has been more like a blockbuster success, taking in $121 million in this country and about as much again overseas.  Other nominees for best film drama included ''Little Children,'' a sober story of married couples in suburbia; ''Bobby,'' which portrays the interlocking lives of people who meet on the night of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles; and ''The Queen,'' a character study of Queen Elizabeth II in the days following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.  The HBO film, ''Elizabeth I,'' also won best TV film, and won a statue for Jeremy Irons as best supporting actor in his portrayal of Elizabeth I's devoted admirer. Peter Morgan won best screenplay for ''The Queen.''  On the television side, Hugh Laurie won for best actor in a series, for his portrayal of a tortured, but talented doctor in ''House.'' He said he was surprised at the win, adding, ''I'm literally without a speech,'' and suggested that with all the presents that come to nominees, no one had thought to offer a free speech. ''There's a gap in the market,'' he said.  Alec Baldwin won for best actor in a television series, musical or comedy for his work in ''30 Rock.''  ''Ugly Betty,'' originally a hit Spanish-language telenovela brought to the United States and shown on ABC, won for best musical or comedy series. The cast, including the producer Salma Hayek and the co-star Vanessa Williams, poured onto the stage to celebrate. America Ferrera, fighting back tears and looking quite beautiful, won best actress in a comedy for playing the lead. ''Thank you for recognizing a character who is truly bringing a new face to television,'' she said, and for bringing a message to young girls that they are ''worthy and lovable.''  The Disney-Pixar film ''Cars'' won best animated feature, in the debut of the category for the Globes.  From the outset, ''Dreamgirls,'' with five nominations, was favored to win the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical. But it has yet to break out as a major hit at the box office, having taken in about $67 million so far in domestic markets.  Other nominees in that category included the mockumentary ''Borat''; ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' the independent hit about a dysfunctional family on the road to a children's beauty contest; ''The Devil Wears Prada''; and ''Thank You for Smoking,'' a satire about lobbying.  In addition to 25 awards for work during 2006, the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award went to the actor and filmmaker Warren Beatty for what the association called his ''outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.'' Mr. Beatty, 69, has made his mark as a political thinker and industry statesman, while directing five films and appearing in nearly two dozen since his 1961 performance in ''Splendor in the Grass.''  Following the event, celebrities, their guests and anyone who could find a way in were scheduled to attend at least seven parties, including two off-site. The physical feat of accommodating so many people can lead to extraordinary measures: HBO had work crews build a floor over the pool at the Beverly Hilton Hotel to accommodate the crowd.  The timing of the Globes -- right after Oscar nomination ballots have been returned, but before those results are announced -- makes for a significant stirring of the awards season tea leaves.  Because the Globes split feature films into two categories -- there are best picture awards for both drama and musical/comedy -- their implications for the Oscar race are not always easy to discern. Last year, ''Brokeback Mountain'' won the Globe for best dramatic picture, but ''Crash,'' an also-ran at the Globes, won the Academy Award for best picture.  This year, early awards season favorites like ''The Departed'' and ''Dreamgirls'' were not in direct competition. Yet several films and individuals arrived this year with much to be gained or lost. ''Dreamgirls'' fell short of early awards hype, and a win gave the musical much needed oxygen for the rest of the awards season.  ''Right now I'm conserving my energy for future projects,'' Mr. Scorsese said before the show of his decision not to campaign actively for awards after having often been spurned in the past. ''But it's good to be here.''  The Academy Award nominations are to be announced on Jan. 23, with the awards given on Feb. 25.  ",

This British author and illustrator, as portrayed by Ms. Zellweger, is almost as chipper as Julie Andrews's Mary Poppins, but twice as affected and not half as English-sounding. If Ms. Zellweger's shaky English accent carried her through two Bridget Jones movies, portraying an upper-middle-class Victorian woman presents a steeper elocutionary challenge. Her enunciation in ''Miss Potter'' lacks the starchy refinement demanded by the role. As she scrunches her face into polite grimaces and trills her phrases, you have the sense of an actor straining not to exhaust a limited repertory of genteel English mannerisms.  In Richard Maltby Jr.'s worshipful screenplay, Potter emerges as a plucky heroine for all seasons: a proto-feminist, a proto-environmentalist and a perfect lady. And from the beginning, this innocuous, fiercely Anglophilic trifle of a movie is too nice for its own good. There was plenty of drama in Potter's life, but the film turns major conflicts and losses into minor setbacks in a charmed, entirely virtuous existence. Even a sudden personal tragedy doesn't devastate this indefatigable font of resilience.  ''Miss Potter'' is easy on the eyes. The first movie directed by the Australian filmmaker Chris Noonan since his sleeper hit, ''Babe,'' 11 years ago, it has the same pastel storybook palette and the same overriding mood of gentleness. Scenes filmed in the English Lake District, where Potter vacationed with her family and studied the local fauna, unfold like heavily captioned pages in a travel brochure.  Any hint of whimsy is welcome. And in the picture's most endearing moments, the author's characters stir to animated life on the page as she communes with them. These touches, of which there are too few, suggest a woman who is much more complicated (and eccentric) than ''Miss Potter'' lets on. They also evoke the intensity of the creative process through which Potter invented her classic characters out of childhood pets and closely observed wildlife.  The movie concentrates on only a few years in the life of Potter, who was born in 1866 and privately published her first book, ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit,'' in 1901. It proved so popular that she took it back to a publisher who had originally rejected it; he reconsidered once she agreed to reillustrate it in color. Published in 1902, it was an enormous hit, and the money she earned from it and its successors brought her independence from her strait-laced, nouveau-riche Victorian family.  The closest thing to a villain in the movie is Potter's snobbish, social-climbing mother, Helen (Barbara Flynn), a stout, severe matriarch who refuses to recognize her daughter's accomplishments even after she earns fame and fortune for her work. Determined that Beatrix marry wealth, she pressures her to choose a husband from a series of suitors, each more grotesque than the one before. Beatrix will have none of it. Her father, Rupert (Bill Paterson), though more sympathetic, kowtows to the will of the fearsome Helen.  Because her publishers, the brothers Harold and Fruing Warne, have low expectations for ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' -- they dismissively refer to it as her ''bunny book'' -- they hand the project to their younger sibling, Norman (Ewan McGregor). The role of a buttoned-up Victorian editor is a complete turnabout from Mr. McGregor's usual rakes, but he inhabits it comfortably. Even after Beatrix and Norman become engaged (over her parents' objections), they continue to address each other as Miss Potter and Mr. Warne.  Potter forms a tight friendship with Warne's unmarried sister, Millie (Emily Watson, emitting mischievous sparks), and their sisterhood -- they agree that there's more to a woman's life than marriage and children -- gives the story its feminist credentials.  Once Potter achieves financial independence, the movie dawdles on pleasantly as she buys Hill Top, a farm in the Lake District, in 1905, and goes on to become a major landowner in the region in a campaign to preserve the area from developers; again, conflicts are minimized.  She later finds romance with a lawyer, William Heelis (Lloyd Owen), whom she would marry in 1913. Potter, who died in 1943, lived way beyond the time frame of the movie. At her death, she left 14 farms and 4,000 acres of land to the National Trust, along with her flocks of Herdwick sheep.  This much sweetness and light in a movie is all very well. But there's a reason that recipes for cake and cookies call for a pinch of salt. In ''Miss Potter,'' there is only a grain or two -- not enough to dilute the sugary overload. The film is the cinematic equivalent of a delicate English tea cake whose substance is buried under too many layers of icing.  ''Miss Potter'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for brief mild language.  Miss Potter  Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.

            "text": "  THE COLD WAR: A New History, by John Lewis Gaddis. (Penguin, $16.) Gaddis, a history professor at Yale, has written six volumes on the cold war. In ''The Cold War: A New History,'' he presents an authoritative account of the Soviet-American conflict, re-evaluating the events and strategies that created, sustained and eventually dismantled the nearly 50-year standoff. Each chapter focuses on a significant theme -- the arms race and the prospect of global annihilation, for example -- and there are fresh assessments of leaders including Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Paul II and Mikhail Gorbachev. Gaddis can now use ''the once-secret information and hindsight that a scholar needs to write true history,'' Michael Beschloss wrote in the Book Review.  ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS: More Venetian Stories, by Jane Turner Rylands. (Anchor, $14.95.) In her second volume of interconnected stories, Rylands examines Venice through the lens of the locals, who take the old-master altarpieces for granted and overlook the shimmering light on the canals. In one story a young thief is redeemed by the unexpected discovery of a lost passport. FALLING PALACE: A Romance of Naples, by Dan Hofstadter. (Vintage, $13.95.) Hofstadter's travelogue lovingly portrays the ancient city with its volcano, its architecture, its animation and a girl, Benedetta, who embodies all these for the author. Our reviewer, Shirley Hazzard, called Hofstadter's observations ''literally breathtaking lyrical in the Neapolitan tradition.''  WATERLOO, by Karen Olsson. (Picador, $14.) A melancholy comedy of Texas politics, Olsson's first novel follows a jaded alternative-weekly reporter, a conservative state assemblywoman and several others as they plan, protest or mourn the razing of two neglected buildings: a music club beloved by aging hipsters and a historically black library.  GOYA, by Robert Hughes. (Knopf, $29.95.) This is a moving, superbly illustrated study of the dark genius of Francisco de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828), informed by the author's own ghastly experience after a car crash. Hughes deconstructs Goya's technique -- his use of light and shadow, his framing of chaotic, sometimes surreal subject matter -- and situates his work against Spain's harrowing war with Napoleon. In the Book Review, Jenny Uglow called Hughes's account ''dazzling, disturbing and intensely personal'': ''We feel the painful immediacy of Goya's work, as if we had one skin less.''  FLEDGLING, by Octavia E. Butler. (Warner, $13.99.) Butler, an internationally acclaimed science fiction writer, died last February at 58. Her 12 novels, set in time periods ranging from the historical past to the distant future, were known for their strong protagonists, many of them black women. Her final book follows Shori, an amnesiac vampire who looks like a 10-year-old black girl, on a dangerous journey of self-discovery and survival.  LIVE FAST, DIE YOUNG: The Wild Ride of Making ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' by Lawrence Frascella and Al Weisel. (Touchstone, $15.) A lively overview of the classic 1955 film, ''Live Fast, Die Young'' reconstructs its tumultuous production history and looks closely at the director Nicholas Ray's relationship with his mercurial, seductive, frustrating star, James Dean.  A DISORDER PECULIAR TO THE COUNTRY, by Ken Kalfus. (Ecco/Harper Perennial, $13.95.) A National Book Award finalist last year, this bitingly satiric novel chronicles the marital split of Joyce and Marshall Harriman, New York professionals with two young children. Kalfus sets their familial hostilities against the background of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. (The novel begins on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001; reasonably imagining that the other has been killed, neither Joyce nor Marshall can escape ''a giddiness, an elation'' at the thought.) ''With cool black humor, Kalfus invites us to compare religious and cultural hatreds with personal ones, refracting his characters' domestic miseries through the light shed by international events,'' Sylvia Brownrigg wrote here.  THE EDIFICE COMPLEX: How the Rich and Powerful -- and Their Architects -- Shape the World, by Deyan Sudjic. (Penguin, $16.) Sudjic, the architecture critic for the London newspaper The Observer, documents 20th-century architectural grandiosity, from presidents and dictators to the merely rich, and the complementary ego of the architects they hire. ''Architecture is about power,'' Sudjic writes. ''Above all, architecture is the means to tell a story about those who build it.''  IHSAN TAYLOR  ",

            "text": "  WHEN the Hollywood studios did early Academy Awards planning this year, they assumed that ''Flags of Our Fathers'' and its director, Clint Eastwood, would be in the thick of things. An industry favorite, he and his films have been nominated three times for best director and best picture and won each twice. With Mr. Eastwood as director and Steven Spielberg as a producer, ''Flags of Our Fathers'' had pedigree, a portentous topic and ferocious backing from Paramount and DreamWorks.  But something funny happened on the way to the podium: Hardly anybody went to see the movie, and critics, who generally swoon when Mr. Eastwood is near, were respectful at best.  This being Hollywood, no one wishes ill of anyone of course -- at least not aloud -- but other parties with big Oscar bets on the table could not be blamed for breathing a collective sigh of relief.  Then in November word came that ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' the much smaller sibling of ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' would be released in December, and consequently be eligible for Academy consideration. While filming ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' about the men who raised the American flag on Iwo Jima, Mr. Eastwood became fascinated by the tenaciousness of the Japanese in a losing battle and conceived, then separately shot, ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' essentially documenting one of World War II's most vicious engagements from both sides. (There are some crisscrossing interests at work: Paramount/DreamWorks own the domestic release for ''Flags'' while Warner Brothers have the foreign rights for that film and both domestic and foreign rights for ''Letters.'')  The original plan -- rendered moot by the underperformance of ''Flags of Our Fathers'' -- had been to release ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' on Feb. 9, 2007, into what was hoped would be another round of post-Oscar nomination buzz. But emboldened by the ecstatic reception when ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' opened in Japan, Mr. Eastwood asked Warner Brothers to move up the release date, effectively reversing the polarity on the films in the long-shot hope that the little film would help the big one.  Warner Brothers has a storied history with Mr. Eastwood that includes a few recent bumps -- he had to drag out the tin cup and use every bit of star power to get both ''Mystic River'' and ''Million Dollar Baby'' made at the studio -- but this time it quickly said yes.  ''There was no long dialogue,'' Alan F. Horn, Warner's chief executive, said. ''We have a long-running, important relationship with Clint. He asked and we said, 'Fine, let's do it.' ''  The scheduling shift did not seem like that big a deal -- after all, it was a small-budget film, in Japanese no less -- but the critics started putting it on their 10 Best lists, the National Board of Review named it best film, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the keepers of the Golden Globes and longtime supporters of Mr. Eastwood, nominated him for not one but two director awards. (Under the association's rules ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' was not eligible for best drama because it is in a foreign language. Instead it received a nomination for best foreign film.) And at the end of last month the American Film Institute named Mr. Eastwood a ''national treasure'' for his two-pronged cinematic assault on Iwo Jima. In essence Mr. Eastwood re-entered the Oscar battle by switching to the losing side.  Mr. Eastwood is an industry favorite because of his ability not only to make first-rate films but to do so with the kind of grace and decency seldom seen in Hollywood. This is not the first time he came swinging out of the trees late in the year and altered the landscape. The release date for ''Million Dollar Baby'' was moved up in 2004, and it took the honors as best picture, passing ''The Aviator,'' directed by Martin Scorsese, late in the season.  For Mr. Scorsese, director of ''The Departed,'' a serious contender this year, it must seem like a bit of unwanted d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. And it creates a logjam of egos and marketing for Warner Brothers, which not only has ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' and ''The Departed,'' but ''Blood Diamond,'' a big budget, big-deal production that was known as a pet project of its star, Leonardo DiCaprio. Edward Zwick, its director, has been down this road before as well. He had a shot at one of the best picture nominations in 2003 with ''The Last Samurai,'' but ''Mystic River'' and Mr. Eastwood both took slots that year.  ''Blood Diamond'' received mixed reviews and underperformed at the box office, but still has very significant support at Warner Brothers, in part because Mr. Horn loves the film. Mr. Zwick said that he feels his movie has received plenty of attention and regards the awards as beyond anyone's control.  ''Every filmmaker feels uneasy about his work being lined up with or compared to another filmmaker's,'' he said. ''Warner Brothers has been nothing but remarkable in their continued support for this movie. They have carried through on every promise.''  Warner Brothers executives say they are happy to find themselves in the midst of what is, after all, a problem of opportunity.  ''Ultimately we try to figure out what is right for each movie and then find a way to make it work,'' said Dawn Taubin, president of domestic marketing at the studio. ''Yes, we had a busy schedule, but this seemed to be in the interest of both films,'' she said, referring to ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' and ''Letters From Iwo Jima.''  Studios generally schedule films with a mix of business metrics and from-the-gut mysticism, jockeying their way around behemoths and putting themselves in a position to crush smaller, weaker opposition. In a very crowded release schedule, especially at the end of the year, marketing must be prepared, trailers must be in place and the hype machine must be engaged. So once an opening date is set, it is switched only with great reluctance.  Unless it's Clint Eastwood who wants it switched. Mr. Eastwood is generally thought to be above a lot of Hollywood nonsense, but he has been both an actor and a politician. He knows how to campaign and is willing to weigh in on behalf of a project he cares about, which, at this stage of his career, includes all of them. Another Oscar is hardly the point, but it is materially significant.  Robert Lorenz, a longtime associate and a producer at Mr. Eastwood's production company, Malpaso Productions, said that awards were not a factor in the change of opening date. (Mr. Eastwood declined an interview request.)  ''I don't think it was calculated on Clint's part,'' Mr. Lorenz said. ''His instincts told him that this was best for the film, not in terms of awards, but you want people to see the movie that you made. The people who had seen 'Letters From Iwo Jima' were blown away by it, and that obviously stuck with Clint.''  There are those who suggest that in seeing to the needs of Mr. Eastwood, Warner Brothers gave a multiple-Oscar winner another bite at the apple in what was already a competitive year.  It is not just Warner Brothers that needs to manage around Mr. Eastwood's remarkable second wind. Paramount, which has both ''Dreamgirls'' and ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' is in the somewhat awkward position of both competing with and supporting him. That studio would be happy if ''Flags'' received more attention, but it would come at the expense of other projects and directors it holds dear, including Bill Condon, who was shut out in Globe nominations for ''Dreamgirls.'' (Mr. Eastwood received two.)  While there is enormous regard for Mr. Eastwood's storied career, there are significant resentments as well, as long as no names are involved. An executive who has several competing projects, fatigued at another year of going head-to-head with Mr. Eastwood, sniped about ''Letters From Iwo Jima'': ''Of course all the critics loved it. The movie takes place in caves and all of the critics live in them.''  Others can't help but be charmed by Mr. Eastwood's resurgence in the race. Anne Thompson, deputy film editor of The Hollywood Reporter, noted that Mr. Eastwood is formidable any year.  ''Sure, he's very low key, but he takes his films to Cannes and has courted critics over the long haul,'' she said. ''He cares deeply about how his films are received. Everyone adores him because, in the face of the inflated formulaic excesses of the studio system, he is still doing it the old way -- with an aesthetic and a sense of storytelling that people can't help but admire -- and continuing to do it over and over again.''  ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' puts a historic tilt on the current race. Other directors have been nominated twice in the same year -- Steven Soderbergh was nominated for both ''Erin Brockovich'' and ''Traffic'' in 2000. (He won for ''Traffic.'') But no other big-name director has split the same subject into two films. ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' belongs in the race, some say, because it is much more an Eastwood film, while ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' with its divergent plotlines and abundant flashbacks, seems to reflect his collaboration with Mr. Spielberg.  Regardless of how the awards shake out, the emergence of ''Letters'' does have the benefit of changing the subject for Mr. Eastwood. Rather than dwelling on why ''Flags'' failed to connect with audiences and awards in the same way his last two films had, the topic is once again Mr. Eastwood's ability to confound expectations.  It is neither a parlor trick nor a gambit. ''Letters From Iwo Jima'' is in the hunt because it is classic American filmmaking, give or take the subtitles. And whether it takes Mr. Eastwood back to the podium on Feb. 25, it represents the kind of innovation that the Academy is not in the habit of ignoring.  THE OSCARS  ",

            "text": "  THE DIVINERS, by Rick Moody. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.99.) This exhilarating satire revolves around a proposed mini-series that follows generations of a tribe of water dowsers, or diviners, from the Mongol hordes to the founding of Las Vegas. There's no script, only a synopsis concocted by an independent film company's office assistant and her lover, a married B-picture action star. Meanwhile, an imperious producer's accountant embezzles thousands of dollars and goes on the lam, and the producer's aging alcoholic mother disappears. Taken together, this kaleidoscopic group forms ''a fitting milieu for Moody's own talent, which is to present an ensemble cast in the grips of ambient hysteria,'' Stephen Metcalf wrote in the Book Review.  FIELD NOTES FROM A CATASTROPHE: Man, Nature, and Climate Change, by Elizabeth Kolbert. (Bloomsbury, $13.95.) Based on a series of articles Kolbert wrote for The New Yorker, this sober book visits scientists around the globe, in places where climate change is affecting the natural world -- from melting ice caps in Greenland and rising water levels in the Netherlands to butterflies in England migrating to higher elevations.  THE GANG THAT WOULDN'T WRITE STRAIGHT: Wolfe, Thompson, Didion, Capote and the New Journalism Revolution, by Marc Weingarten. (Three Rivers, $13.95.) This is an enthusiastic group biography of the talented, disparate writers whose dramatically personal nonfiction of the 1960s and '70s represented ''the last, great good time of American journalism.'' Weingarten examines the making of the period's best-known journalism, including Hunter S. Thompson's misadventures with the Hell's Angels and Truman Capote's research in Holcomb, Kan., for ''In Cold Blood.''  HERSHEY: Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams, by Michael D'Antonio. (Simon & Schuster, $15.) ''If it's a rule that behind every great fortune lies a great crime, M. S. Hershey was the exception,'' D'Antonio, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, writes in this thorough and highly readable biography of the candy magnate. D'Antonio recounts how Hershey, born on a Pennsylvania farm in 1857, founded what became the world's largest chocolate factory, built a utopian worker-village that still draws millions of tourists a year, and placed much of his fortune in trust to a school that he started for orphans. ''While some look at Hershey and see either a beneficent angel or a willful tyrant, it is the great charm of D'Antonio's book that he will not plunk entirely for one judgment or the other,'' Benjamin Cheever wrote here.  THE FUGITIVE WIFE, by Peter C. Brown. (Norton, $14.95.) In Brown's enormously satisfying first novel, a Minnesota farm girl gives up on her alcoholic husband and impulsively joins a crew of gold prospectors bound for Alaska at the turn of the 20th century.  COUSINS AND STRANGERS: America, Britain, and Europe in a New Century, by Chris Patten. (Times/Holt, $17.) In this penetrating analysis Patten -- chancellor of Oxford, former chairman of Britain's Conservative Party and the last British governor of Hong Kong -- inspects the fault lines of international politics, taking an uncharitable view of the forces that have weakened the trans-Atlantic bond. Our reviewer, Josef Joffe, called ''Cousins and Strangers'' a ''brilliantly catty and nicely constructed text.''  THE CALIPH'S HOUSE, by Tahir Shah. (Bantam, $13.) In early 2003, the British travel writer Shah, right, moved his young family into a sprawling mansion in a Casablanca slum. ''The Caliph's House'' is Shah's alternately comical and alarming account of how he restored the place, which was infested not only with all manner of earthly pests but also with magical spirits that love to haunt unoccupied houses. In the Book Review, Adam Goodheart said Shah's narrative is ''enlivened by well-wrought descriptions of life in Casablanca: a place suspended between modernity and the Middle Ages, between Europe and Africa.'' In his absorbing memoir GOLDEN BOY: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood (Picador, $14), the British novelist and popular historian Martin Booth, who died in 2004, recalls his adventures as a streetwise 7-year-old when his father, a navy clerk, was posted in Hong Kong in 1952.  TIMOTHY: Or, Notes of an Abject Reptile, by Verlyn Klinkenborg. (Vintage, $12.) Blending nature writing and novelistic invention, Klinkenborg, a member of the editorial board of The New York Times and the author of ''The Rural Life,'' takes us inside the watchful mind of an 18th-century tortoise, who is abducted from the Turkish coast and ends up in the garden of the curate and naturalist Gilbert White.

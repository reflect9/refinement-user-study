According to Nielsen's estimates, ''CSI'' drew just under 21 million viewers, to 21.4 million for ''Grey's Anatomy.'' CBS finished No. 1 for the night in total viewers, but ABC dominated among adults 18 to 49. At 8, a rebroadcast of CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (12.4 million) finished first ahead of ABC's ''Ugly Betty'' (9.8 million), which posted its best ratings for a rerun. A rerun of CBS's ''Shark'' (14 million) led at 10 in total viewers, while ABC's ''Men in Trees'' (11 million) edged it out among adults 18 to 49, posting a series high in that demographic. NBC was third for the night with a lineup of comedy reruns from 8 to 11. ''My Name Is Earl'' at 8 (8.4 million) and ''The Office'' at 8:30 (7.8 million), led at 8 among adults 18 to 49.

According to Nielsen's estimates, the sixth edition of the Donald Trump series, ''The Apprentice,'' relocated from New York to Los Angeles, earned 9.1 million viewers from 9:30 to 11 p.m., about even with February's premiere of ''The Apprentice 5.'' NBC fared slightly better earlier in the night, as its musical competition, ''Grease: You're the One That I Want,'' averaged 11.6 million viewers from 8 to 9:30. NBC ranked fourth for the night in total viewers, but third among adults 18 to 49. Fox led over all, benefiting from an overrun of its afternoon coverage of the Philadelphia Eagles victory over the New York Giants. ABC was No. 2 for the night, winning the 8 and 9 p.m. hours with ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' (13.4 million) and ''Desperate Housewives'' (18.6 million). CBS, which broadcast new episodes of ''Cold Case'' at 9 (14.1 million) and ''Without a Trace'' at 10 (14.2 million), finished the night in fourth among adults 18 to 49, but ahead of NBC in total viewers.

In the race for No. 2, CBS outdrew NBC, and both networks overshadowed the premieres on ABC. CBS's only new show of the night, ''The King of Queens,'' ranked second at 8 p.m. with 8.6 million viewers. It was followed by repeats of ''Two and a Half Men'' at 8:30 (8.5 million), ''Criminals Minds'' at 9 (11.9 Million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10 (10.4 million). NBC was not far behind, getting a boost from ''Deal or No Deal'' at 9 (11.3 million) and ''Medium'' at 10 (9.3 million). Faring less well for NBC, ''Friday Night Lights'' earned 6.3 million viewers at 8. ABC was last over all, despite the season premiere of ''According to Jim'' at 8 (7.4 million). Neither of ABC's new comedies, ''Knights of Prosperity'' at 9 (7.2 million) or ''In Case of Emergency'' at 9:30 (6.3 million), fared better than fourth place.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

According to Nielsen's estimates, ''Prison Break'' matched a season's best 9.9 million viewers at 8 p.m., while the sixth hour of ''24'' earned 14 million viewers to lead the 9 p.m. hour in total viewers ahead of NBC's ''Heroes'' (13.6 million). ''Heroes'' did remain the night's highest-rated show in the 18 to 49 demographic, ahead of second-place ''24.'' For the night, NBC outdrew Fox by a half million total viewers. Its game show at 8, ''Deal or No Deal,'' claimed the title of most-watched show on Monday (16.9 million), but the 10 o'clock hour remained NBC's weakest, as ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' attracted 7 million viewers opposite a repeat of CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (13.4 million). CBS broadcast reruns of its comedy lineup from 8 to 10 and finished third over all. ABC was fourth, despite new episodes of ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.7 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (5.7 million).  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

According to Nielsen's estimates, the Day 6 debut earned 15.7 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m. Sunday, a slight decline over its year-ago season premiere (16.2 million). However, Monday's two-hour second installment also drew 15.7 million viewers, a modest improvement over the fifth season's second episode (14.9 million). CBS was No. 1 on Sunday, benefiting from an overrun of its N.F.L. playoffs coverage, followed by an interview with President Bush on ''60 Minutes'' at approximately 8:30 (17.2 million). ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' (16.7 million) also outdrew ''24'' during the 9 p.m. hour Sunday. On Monday, NBC's telecast of the 64th annual Golden Globes led during every half-hour of the night and averaged 20 million viewers over all, that award show's highest ratings in three years. NBC fared less well Sunday as the second week of ''Grease: You're the One That I Want'' at 8 (8.2 million) and ''The Apprentice'' at 9 (7.3 million) fell to fourth place.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

CBS was a distant second in total viewers, as ''CSI: New York'' (13.4 million) led the 10 o'clock hour. CBS's new reality show, ''Armed and Famous'' (4.7 million), sank to fourth place at 8. NBC edged out CBS in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic for the night, winning second place behind Fox with the help of ''Deal or No Deal'' at 9 (10.1 million). Nielsen also estimated that the State of the Union address, carried live on Tuesday by nine national broadcast and cable networks, drew almost four million viewers more than President Bush's 2006 address (45.5 million, compared with 41.7 million). Despite the overall increase, the Fox News channel drew its smallest audience for a State of the Union by Mr. Bush, off nearly two million viewers from a year ago (4.6 million, compared with 6.5 million). Fox News's coverage remained first among cable channels, but No. 2 CNN saw a slight increase (to 2.4 million from 2.2 million) and No. 3 MSNBC's audience more than doubled, to 1.6 million viewers from 707,000.

According to Nielsen's estimate, NBC's ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' garnered 13.4 million viewers at 9 p.m., the show's largest audience in more than a year. NBC also dominated the 10 p.m. hour with ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (15.1 million), which drew the night's highest ratings. NBC's ''Dateline'' (9.5 million) ranked second in the 8 p.m. hour. Meanwhile Orange Bowl coverage of Louisville's win over Wake Forest appeared to give Fox an edge over CBS for No. 2 for the night. The game averaged 10.6 million viewers according to time-zone adjusted estimates. CBS received relatively strong ratings for repeats of ''NCIS'' at 8 (13 million) and ''The Unit'' at 9 (9.1 million), but a rerun of ''Numb3rs,'' which is usually broadcast on Fridays, earned 6.7 million viewers at 10. ABC finished fourth with repeats of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' at 8 (8.1 million) and ''Boston Legal'' at 10 (5 million), as well as two new episodes of ''Big Day'' at 9 (5.2 million) and 9:30 (4.8 million).

According to Nielsen's preliminary estimates, which do not account for discrepancies across time zones, approximately 14 million viewers tuned in during prime-time hours to watch the game, which kicked off at 8:53 p.m. and lasted until 12:51 a.m. CBS was second for the night in total viewers, getting a boost at 9 from ''Two and a Half Men'' (12.1 million) and at 10 from ''CSI: Miami'' (12.1 million). Among adults 18 to 49, ABC appeared to edge out CBS for second place, dominating the 8 p.m. hour because of an overrun of its afternoon football coverage of the Rose Bowl. Later in the night, however, repeats of ABC's ''Supernanny'' at 9 (6.7 million) and 10 (6.9 million) ranked a distant third. NBC was fourth over all with a marathon of ''Heroes'' repeats, which drew 5.5 million viewers at 8, 5.2 million at 9 and 4.6 million at 10.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

Earlier in the night, from 8 to 9 p.m., ''The O'Reilly Factor'' saw its ratings soar 46 percent over its fourth-quarter average last year, to nearly 3 million viewers. Among ''Factor'' viewers ages 25 to 54, a demographic in which Mr. Colbert's show regularly draws more viewers, the increase was even more pronounced.

Lincoln has fallen desperately behind the luxury leaders,  and this dramatic chrome-face concept shows Lincoln reasserting its American roots.  What they said: ''We're referring to the past without repeating it,'' Peter Horbury, Ford's director of design for the Americas, said.  What they didn't say: In following the lead of the Mercedes-Benz CLS by styling a four-door sedan to look like a sexy coupe, Lincoln is also distancing itself from retro designs that lacked new ideas.  What makes it tick? Behind its grinning mug -- a nod to the '41 Lincoln Continental Cabriolet -- there's a 415-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 with direct fuel injection and two turbochargers. The engine is E85 ethanol-ready, and Ford claims better fuel economy than a comparably powerful V-8.  How much, how soon?: The engine is part of a new ''TwinForce'' family that should begin powering Ford and Lincoln models by about 2009.  How's it look?: A shot of design adrenaline that -- if actually administered  to showroom models -- could wake Lincoln from its long coma.  ",

            "text": "  The Bowl Championship Series title game ended badly for the top-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on Monday, but it was a huge success for the Fox television network. According to Nielsen's time-zone-adjusted estimates, the football game dominated in every half-hour of the night, attracting 28.7 million viewers. Among adults 18 to 49, Fox posted its highest-rated Monday in three years. CBS ranked second for the night, aided by ''CSI: Miami'' at 10 (15.9 million) and its comedies in the 9 p.m. hour, ''Two and a Half Men'' (14.8 million) and ''The New Adventures of Old Christine'' (12.2 million). NBC was No. 2 in the 8 o'clock hour with ''Deal or No Deal'' (14 million), but its two repeats of ''Heroes'' finished last at 9 (5.7 million) and 10 (4.1 million). ABC's line-up of ''Wife Swap'' at 8 (8 million), ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.1 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (4.7 million) once again put the network in fourth place for the night in total viewers, but among adults 18 to 49, NBC lagged slightly behind it.

            "text": "  Introduced on Monday:Honda Accord Coupe Concept  Is it real? Some automakers' concepts are nothing but car teases; Honda, bless them, moves its concepts swiftly to showrooms with few changes. Expect the 2008 Accord coupe to strongly resemble this sweet-looking machine.  What's the point? Coupes are staging a comeback, and Honda wants its two-door Accord to lure a good chunk of under-30 buyers. Vastly more extroverted than the previous Accord coupe, the new model harvests styling cues from several of its two-door competitors -- including Nissan and Infiniti.  What they said: Honda executives extolled the Accord's three decades of excellence, but the press conferences' choice of musical accompaniment may have summed up the new model best: ''I'll Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor,'' by the Arctic Monkeys.  What they didn't say: Compelling new coupes like this Accord, and its competitors from Ford, Scion and Nissan, will solidify the Toyota Solara's position as the segment's maiden aunt. The pressure will be on Toyota to swap Solara's flannel-petticoat exterior for something more silken and sexy.  What makes it tick? Honda is being coy on particulars, but the eighth-generation Accord coupe and sedan will certainly continue to offer four- and six-cylinder engines.  How much, how soon? The Accord coupe and sedan go on sale in the fall, probably starting below $20,000 and topping $30,000 for loaded versions.  How's it look? Finally, not like the Accord sedan.  ",

            "text": "  With the best ratings for an American Football Conference championship game in 10 years, CBS's coverage of the Indianapolis Colts' victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday outdrew even last week's ''American Idol'' premiere telecasts to usurp the title of highest-rated program of the 2006-7 television season. According to Nielsen's estimates, which do not account for discrepancies across time zones, the game averaged approximately 43 million viewers for the night. ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' was the second-most-watched show on Sunday, delivering a much-reduced 17.1 million viewers at 9. ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' at 8 (12.6 million) and ''Brothers & Sisters'' at 10 (11.9 million) helped ABC secure a distant but respectable second-place finish for the night. NBC was third over all, as ratings for Week 3 of its reality shows ''Grease: You're the One That I Want'' at 8 (8.1 million) and ''The Apprentice'' at 9 (6.9 million) remained steady after falling in the shows' second week.

                    "text": "  The sites were not glamorous -- a raceway in Yonkers, a union hall in Hauppauge on Long Island, the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Wash. -- and the pay was not great, either. He earned anywhere from $50 to $12,000 per fight, and sometimes a night at a discount motel and a day's worth of meal vouchers.  Still, Kemal Kolenovic loved the fighting life unequivocally. At age 28, his record was fairly unremarkable: 10 victories, 6 losses and 2 draws with nine years under his belt as a professional boxer. But even those numbers, if looked at a certain way, owed something to an attitude that valued enthusiasm over rigor and reduced the science of a boxing match to youthful play.  ''He was an all-out brawler, not much of a technical boxer, but he had a blast just throwing punches, and he was good at it,'' said Tony Kalaj, a friend who works for Joe DeGuardia's Star Boxing, a fight promotion company. ''The record? It was hard for him to get fights with his style. He made opponents look stupid.''  Two days ago in the Bronx, Mr. Kolenovic was killed after a barroom brawl in which the police said he had not participated. Sometime after 4:30 a.m. on Sunday, he was run over by a man driving a sport utility vehicle. The man was fleeing the Moonlight Restaurant and Bar on Belmont Avenue, where he and others, but not Mr. Kolenovic, had argued over which Albanian surnames were most associated with tougher and generally superior people.  The men had taken the fight outside. Mr. Kolenovic, who was at the Moonlight with an uncle, Tony Mujovic, 35, had eventually followed them onto the sidewalk and joined a group that had gathered, perhaps just to see what was going on or perhaps, Mr. Mujovic said, to try to get them to break it up. One of the men climbed into a dark sport utility vehicle and plowed into the crowd. The driver fled, and the police said last night that he was still at large.  The S.U.V. hit Mr. Kolenovic and threw him headfirst into a tree. He was pronounced dead shortly afterward at St. Barnabas Hospital.  ''We sat around reviewing what the security camera got,'' said Al Kolenovic, a cousin. ''You see Kemal sitting outside, wanting to leave. The poor guy's got his hands in his pockets, with his back to the car. He didn't know what hit him.''  Yesterday at midday, three or four dozen men who said they were cousins of Mr. Kolenovic gathered in Astoria, Queens, at the Islamic Unity and Culture Center of Plav-Gusinje, a Muslim mosque that serves the city's Montenegrin community.  About half of them sat around folding tables in the basement; the rest spilled outside, onto the corner of 12th Street and 31st Avenue. They were long-faced and mostly with dark hair, and a good number of them smoked cigarettes in the rain. The women in their lives -- sisters, spouses, mothers -- were inside, upstairs with scarves over their heads, kneeling in front of prayer mats.  ''Right now, it's the women's turn,'' Al Kolenovic said. ''And then the men again. Both groups do it five times a day until the deceased has his burial. Pretty sad story.''  He said the burial was to take place today at a Balkan cemetery in Monticello, N.Y., pending the approval of the boxer's mother, Sanija Kolenovic. She flew from her home in Germany and was due to arrive at the mosque at any minute.  Several friends from the boxing community had been by to pay their respects, including Elvir Muriqi, an Albanian whose boxing nickname is the Kosovo Kid. Joe Antonacci, a ring announcer, described Mr. Kolenovic as ''a beautiful person in a brutal, lonely, thankless game.''  ''He had such charisma in the ring,'' Mr. Antonacci went on. ''He looked like Brian Setzer from the Stray Cats -- that blond hair combed back. He had a big Albanian following, obviously. But he couldn't go into an arena and not make fans. He was a nonstop movement fighter, fast hands, lots of spirit.''  Mr. Kolenovic fought as a welterweight. He was 5-foot-7 and weighed about 150 pounds. He came to Brooklyn from Montenegro in 1993, when he was 14 or 15, without his parents. He worked construction and washed dishes in restaurants to pay rent. He lived in Midwood.  Mr. Kolenovic worked with a few trainers in his career. The last was Chelo Betancourt, who worked with him at Gleason's Gym in Dumbo.  ''He was such a tough kid, a lot of championship fighters liked to spar with him because he could take it and he could adjust his style to match any fighter,'' Mr. Betancourt said. ''Antonio Diaz brought him out to Texas when he was training for a title fight, paid him $150 a day to stay out there and spar for a few weeks.''  In 2003, Mr. Kolenovic beat Fontaine Cabell for the New York State welterweight title. ''The promoters were looking for a walkover opponent, but we prepared good,'' Mr. Betancourt said. He said that Mr. Kolenovic won by technical knockout ''by counterpunching the whole way,'' and that ''he shocked everybody.''  The following year, Mr. Kolenovic lost his title defense, also by technical knockout. Mr. Betancourt said that he was underprepared because he had been spending more time drinking with friends than in the gym, and that he had advised him not to take the fight when he did.  At times, said Mr. Kalaj, the promoter: ''They threw him in with the wolves. He got robbed a lot by hometown referees.''  Around 3 p.m. yesterday, the car driving Mr. Kolenovic's mother pulled up at the mosque. She sobbed as she was escorted inside and up the stairs. When she approached her son's body in the open coffin, she clutched her head, dropped to her knees, and screamed.  All the men upstairs stood at the side of the room, while the women surrounded Mr. Kolenovic's body, also crying. Mrs. Kolenovic, who cried the loudest, took her son's face in her hands and held it.

Since their father was in prison, she left the boys with their grandmother, Dorothy Townsend, and never came back.  The twins are now 6 years old. Ms. Townsend cares for them, helps with their homework, and keeps a tidy home. But she has trouble getting around -- the result of a childhood battle with polio and a nasty fall two years ago. She needs physical and financial assistance, and the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, a beneficiary of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provides some.  The bureau's workers take the children to school and help chase after them at home. The bureau also bought Ms. Townsend and the boys new clothing, beds and a dining set. Ms. Townsend still struggles to make ends meet, but the bureau helps. ''They did a lot for my boys,'' she said, ''they really did.''  All the money donated to the Neediest Cases Fund goes to one of seven charities: the Children's Aid Society; the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; the Community Service Society of New York; the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and the UJA-Federation of New York.

                    "text": "  The stock market retreated last week as investors calculated that interest rates won't be dropping when Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Wednesday.  Several government reports suggested that the economy remains robust -- perhaps too much so to justify a cut in the Fed funds rate, the Fed's benchmark short-term rate, which has remained at 5.25 percent since June. On Friday, for example, the Commerce Department said that new-home sales in December jumped to an annual rate of 1.12 million units, and durable-goods orders in December rose 3.1 percent. Both were more than Wall Street had expected.  Shares of General Motors gained 4.4 percent for the week, the most among the Dow industrials. The company said it would report a profit for the fourth quarter, although its 2006 financial results would be delayed.  For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 78.51 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 12,487.02. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 8.32 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,422.18. The Nasdaq composite index lost 15.82 points, or about 0.7 percent, to close at 2,435.49.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond climbed to 4.87 percent from 4.78 percent the previous week.  JEFF SOMMER  DataBank  ",

                    "text": "  With his proposal to uproot a tax break that has been in place for more than 60 years, President Bush has touched off an impassioned debate over the future of the employer-based system that provides health insurance to more than half of all Americans.  ''Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans,'' Mr. Bush said in his State of the Union address this week.  Mr. Bush said his proposal would eliminate a bias in the tax code that strongly favored insurance provided by employers over coverage bought by individuals and families outside the workplace.  Paul Fronstin, director of health research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization, said: ''The president's proposal would mean the end of employer-based benefits as we know them. It gives employers a way out of providing the benefits because their employees could get the same tax break on their own.''  Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, denied that the president wanted to move people away from the employer-based system and toward the individual insurance market. ''We are seriously agnostic on that,'' he said.  It might take years for changes to occur. ''Large corporate employers could not immediately terminate their health benefits because there is, at present, no reliable place where employees can get coverage they can afford outside the workplace,'' said Frank B. McArdle, a health policy expert at Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm.  The economic rationale for Mr. Bush's proposal is that too many people have ''gold-plated, deluxe'' health insurance, which encourages them to use excessive amounts of health care, driving up costs for everyone.  Many economists agree. But they doubt that Mr. Bush's proposal would do much to hold down costs or cover more people.  ''The president's proposal addresses inequities in the tax code that provide an open-ended subsidy for premiums paid by employers,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''If your employer does not provide health insurance and you have to buy it on your own, you get no tax benefit at all. The president's plan would eliminate that distinction.''  But Mr. Reischauer said, ''A glaring problem with the president's plan is that he did not call for any stronger regulation of the individual insurance market.'' In that market as it now exists in most states, insurers can deny coverage or charge higher rates to sick people.  In their desire to achieve universal coverage, some Democrats have also begun to raise questions about the employer-based system. ''We have to ask ourselves if the employer-based system of health care is still the best way for providing insurance to all Americans,'' said Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, noting that workers frequently changed jobs.  The Service Employees International Union negotiates with employers to secure health benefits for its members, but the president of the union, Andrew L. Stern, said, ''The current employer-based health care system is not the foundation for 21st-century health care reform.''  Mr. Bush's proposal differs radically from President Bill Clinton's plan for universal coverage, but experts on health benefits said they were similar in one respect: In an effort to help the uninsured -- about one-sixth of the population -- they would upend the system that covers most Americans.  The Clinton plan would have provided comprehensive health benefits to 39 million uninsured Americans, with more than $400 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. The White House says the tax changes proposed by Mr. Bush would provide coverage for 3 million to 5 million people at no cost to the government over 10 years.  Since Mr. Bush took office in 2001, the number of people without insurance has increased by more than 5 million, to 46.6 million, according to the Census Bureau. Administration officials said they hoped to reverse that trend by helping states that offered basic private insurance policies to their residents. To pay for such help, the administration would take federal money from hospitals that serve large numbers of poor people.  Under Mr. Bush's proposal, employee health benefits would, for the first time, be treated as income and would be subject to income and payroll taxes, just like wages. At the same time, Mr. Bush would create a tax deduction for health insurance of $15,000 for families and $7,500 for individuals. The same deduction would be available to everyone with coverage, regardless of the source or value of the policy.  A family with coverage worth $18,000 would have to pay taxes on the amount exceeding the $15,000 standard deduction -- $3,000, in this example.  Katherine Baicker, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said the proposal would increase taxes for 30 million people with the most generous employer-provided health benefits, unless they ''change their behavior'' and choose less costly coverage. Ms. Baicker said the proposal would cut taxes for more than 100 million people who bought insurance on their own or had employee health benefits worth less than the standard deduction.  Treasury officials said that under the Bush proposal, an uninsured family of four with an annual income of $60,000 would save $4,545 if it bought coverage in the individual market. By contrast, they said, a family that earns $80,000 and has employer-provided coverage worth $20,000 could see a tax increase of about $1,500.  Joel D. Kaplan, deputy chief of staff at the White House, acknowledged that the proposal could accelerate the trend of employers' dropping health benefits for employees. But he said more people ''would be able to buy insurance in the individual market,'' so there would be ''a net increase in the number of insured.''  Politicians and health care providers are skeptical.  Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, said, ''The president's proposal would do little to help the uninsured, but would undermine the employer-based system through which 160 million people get coverage.''  Richard J. Umbdenstock, president of the American Hospital Association, agreed. ''The tax proposal would have the effect of driving people to the small-group insurance market -- a market that has proved unstable,'' Mr. Umbdenstock said. ''For many people, even with a tax break, coverage would remain unaffordable.''  Historically, employers have used benefits as a tool to recruit workers and keep them healthy and productive.  R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, praised the general direction of the president's proposal but said his members had serious concerns.  First, Mr. Josten said, the $15,000 cap on tax-free insurance takes no account of wide geographic variation in the cost of health care and insurance. The same package of benefits typically costs more in Boston than in Minneapolis, for example.  Moreover, Mr. Josten said, a health plan may be expensive because it covers older workers with major medical problems, not because it is ''gold-plated.'' A single mother, working as a low-paid secretary at a law firm, could be pushed into a higher tax bracket because she participates in an $18,000 health plan covering older men who have had heart attacks and expensive surgery, Mr. Josten said.  Treasury officials acknowledged that some people with costly, comprehensive benefits had modest incomes.  But deluxe health plans are vanishingfast. In recent years, many workers have found themselves paying more for less comprehensive benefits. From 2000 to 2006, premiums for employer-sponsored coverage rose 87 percent, about four times as fast as workers' earnings, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ",

                    "text": "  On one of the deadliest days for United States forces since the Iraq war began, an American helicopter crashed in a Sunni area north of Baghdad on Saturday, killing all 13 people onboard, the United States military said.  Iraqi officials in the area said it had been shot down, though there was no immediate confirmation from American officials.  In separate episodes, five American soldiers were killed and three wounded in a battle with gunmen who attacked the local governor's office in the Shiite holy city of Karbala, and two soldiers died from other attacks, military officials said.  It was not clear whether all those on the helicopter were Americans. If they were, 20 uniformed Americans died Saturday. On the worst day of the war for American forces, Jan. 26, 2005, 37 American service members died. Thirty-one of them died when a Marine helicopter crashed in the western desert, and six others in combat that day.  An Interior Ministry official and the police in Diyala Province said Saturday that the American helicopter was shot down about 4 p.m. by insurgents who had fired missiles or grenades from at least two locations. It crashed near Tarrafa Village, they said, over a rural area near the Diyala River.  The American military said that debris had been immediately surrounded and secured. Several hours after the crash, soldiers were still combing through the wreckage.  A spokesman declined to provide details on the type of aircraft or how it crashed. The number of people aboard suggested that it had been a Black Hawk transport helicopter, which typically carries about 10 passengers and 4 crew members.  The crash occurred northeast of Baghdad near Baquba, where American and Iraqi forces have been battling Sunni insurgents and Shiite militia forces for months.  The American military also announced seven other deaths on Saturday and three deaths from earlier in the week. In addition to the five soldiers killed during the battle in Karbala, a soldier was killed in northern Baghdad on Saturday when a roadside bomb exploded near his patrol, and another, assigned to a unit of engineers, died of wounds from a roadside bomb in northern Iraq.  The three earlier deaths were of a sailor from Brooklyn who died Wednesday in a ''noncombat-related incident'' at Camp Bucca, an American-run detention center in southern Iraq; a marine who died Friday from wounds suffered in combat in Anbar Province; and a soldier who died Friday after being wounded by a roadside bomb in Tikrit, north of Baghdad.  The gun battle in Karbala started when ''an illegally armed militia,'' according to a statement from the American military, attacked the offices of the provincial government in Karbala with guns and grenades.  Brig. Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, deputy commander for Multi-National Division-Baghdad, said American and Iraqi security forces were meeting at the time of the attack to ensure that Shiite pilgrims would be safe during the celebrations later this month for Ashura, one of Shiite Islam's holiest days, which marks the seventh-century martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson, Hussein.  Iraqi state television reported that at least two dozen gunmen assaulted the building, getting inside, and drawing a response from American troops who were dropped by helicopter onto the roof.  Col. Scott Bleichwehl, a military spokesman, said it was not clear who or how many had attacked. By 10 p.m., the building had been secured, he said.  ''It was never lost,'' he said. ''It came under fire from a couple of directions. We responded to it.''  The attack nonetheless seemed to be the latest in a series of power struggles in the south among a patchwork of Shiite tribes and political parties. American officials have been pressing the government of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to set a date for provincial elections, which they said would firmly establish new leaders and possibly reduce the fighting.  Iraqi state television reported that a raid in south Baghdad on Saturday, with around 100 Iraqi police commandos backed by six United States helicopters, killed 15 suspected Sunni Arab insurgents.  The police found 29 bodies in the capital, many with gunshot wounds to the head.  THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ  ",

                    "text": "  WHEN General Motors unwraps the Chevrolet Volt for the press today at the North American International Auto Show, it will be revealing much more than the latest fantasy from its styling studios.  Beyond its striking coupelike lines, the Volt is also a declaration of G.M.'s intent to mass-produce a new type of hybrid-electric vehicle, one that can drive up to 40 miles on batteries alone and recharge itself with an onboard generator -- or by plugging into a standard 110-volt household outlet.  The Volt is also less than it appears. The batteries to make it roadworthy do not yet exist, a shortcoming G.M. acknowledges.  This squat four-seat hybrid sedan previews a new family of plug-in electric drive systems that G.M. calls E-Flex. The system, which the company plans to begin installing globally when the battery technology is mature, will be capable of delivering the equivalent of 100 miles a gallon or more in urban driving, G.M. officials said. The Volt's total range is 640 miles using the combined capacity of fully charged batteries and a built-in gasoline-powered generator.  Plug-in hybrids have drawn a great deal of attention recently, and several automakers have built prototypes to test their feasibility. G.M. announced last fall that it was developing a plug-in version of the Saturn Vue hybrid and last week awarded contracts for advanced lithium-ion batteries.  But the E-Flex design goes further, and it differs from any gasoline-electric hybrid in showrooms. While hybrids like the Toyota Prius can drive short distances on battery power and make longer trips using a thrifty gasoline engine -- and if needed, draw on both power sources -- the Volt's gas engine is not connected to the wheels. It turns only a generator to charge the battery pack, a design typically called a series hybrid, and operates in a narrow r.p.m range for maximum efficiency.  In the Volt, the E-Flex drive system consists of a small three-cylinder gas engine, a 53-kilowatt generator and a long lithium-ion battery pack that forms a spine down the center of the car's floor. The battery supplies electricity for the 120-kilowatt (160 horsepower) motor that drives the car's front wheels.  To maximize battery life, the engine that drives the generator automatically kicks in when the battery's charge falls below 30 percent of capacity and shuts off when the battery charge reaches 80 percent of maximum; at that point E-Flex reverts to pure electric mode.  ''We've dubbed this feature a 'range extender,' '' said Robert A. Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman for product development. ''It also provides a steady flow of electricity to get the vehicle home or to the nearest charging plug,'' he said, as long as there is fuel in the Volt's twin six-gallon tanks.  Mr. Lutz added that for the 78 percent of commuters in the United States whose daily round trip to work is 40 miles or less, according to the Department of Transportation, a Volt-size vehicle with E-Flex would make the commute using only the battery, ''without burning a drop of petroleum.'' Some type of fuel will be consumed to generate the electricity, of course.  For a 60-mile round trip, Mr. Lutz reasoned that the Volt would get the equivalent of 150 m.p.g. over all; the first 40 miles in pure-electric mode and the last 20 miles with the gas engine sipping fuel at a rate of 50 m.p.g. as it charges the battery.  G.M. engineers, who estimated the Volt's performance using computer simulations, said charging the battery from a 30 percent level would take about a half-hour while under way and up to 6.5 hours when plugged into a standard 15-amp household outlet.  Similar overall ratings of more than 100 m.p.g. are claimed by advocates of plug-in hybrids. According to Calcars.com, the Web site of the California Cars Initiative and an independent advocate of plug-ins, 30 miles of battery-only driving at the average cost of 9 cents a kilowatt-hour in the United States would cost 81 cents, compared with the average $2.40 gallon of regular gasoline required to propel a relatively miserly conventional car the same distance.  The Volt's estimated annual fuel savings of about 500 gallons, compared with a similar size 30-m.p.g. vehicle driving 15,000 miles a year, equate to $900, even considering the cost of the electricity, said Tony Posawatz, an engineering manager in the Volt program.  He added that while switching the United States to plug-in hybrids over time would increase overall electricity use and that rates would increase, the price of powering vehicles from the grid during off-peak hours would be roughly one-third the equivalent price of gasoline.  G.M. is planning to offer E-Flex power systems in all major world markets, according to Jonathan J. Lauckner, vice president for global vehicle programs. He said the company's next-generation compact-car platform, due in 2009, had been designed to accept an E-Flex battery pack, generator and related hardware.  For some applications, E-Flex would not require any range-extending engine. Instead, it could be a pure-electric vehicle used for local deliveries and charged directly from the power grid. G.M. is also developing a hydrogen version, with a small fuel-cell stack replacing the combustion engine for electricity generation.  While development of the new electric drive system has already begun, the company cannot set a production schedule until the proper batteries are ready, said Nick Zielinski, the Volt's chief engineer.  ''We believe lithium-ion will begin replacing today's nickel-metal hydride as the battery chemistry for hybrid use around 2010,'' he explained. Lithium-ion offers two to three times the energy storage and power density of nickel-metal hydride, said Martin Klein, engineering director of Compact Power, a division of LG Chemical of South Korea that is developing lithium-ion batteries.  He said achieving the Volt's goal of 40 miles of pure-electric operation was feasible. But Mr. Klein said he believed the challenge would be in developing small, light batteries that still met the target for driving distance between charges.  Battery weight, the Achilles' heel of hybrids, hurts vehicle performance, so G.M. is keen to trim some of Volt's hefty 3,200 pounds. Mr. Zielinski winced as he noted that early projections for Volt included a 400-pound battery pack, though that is still less than half the weight of the nickel-metal hydride batteries used in G.M.'s EV1. G.M.'s cancellation of its EV1 electric car stirred up environmentalists, but Mr. Lutz said the project's results were paying off.  ''The EV1 was a great engineering achievement, but it was severely limited in operating range by its battery,'' he said. ''We learned that customers did not want to plan their lives around the next battery charge.''  Battery development and production costs are likely to add thousands to the price of the early E-Flex vehicles, G.M. admitted. But the company was optimistic that incentives offered by local governments and electric utilities would help drive sales.  Skeptics include John German, environmental analysis manager for Honda in the United States. In Congressional testimony last year, he said that a business case for plug-in hybrids would not exist unless fuel prices were above $3 a gallon, shortages had occurred, technology was subsidized or a breakthrough in energy storage emerged.  None of that deters Mr. Lauckner, the G.M. vice president. ''This program is not a public relations ploy,'' he said. ''We are dead serious about taking this technology into high-volume production.''

                    "text": "  THE CASTLE IN THE FOREST  By Norman Mailer.  477 pp.  Random House. $27.95  There is a semi-harrowing, careening, self-burlesquing moment that occurs deep in Norman Mailer's ''Armies of the Night,'' his third-person account of taking part in the massive protest against the Vietnam War in Washington in October 1967 -- not only an American masterpiece, but one of the most liberating books ever swirled into being by a human mind. Mailer has succeeded in getting himself arrested, and he's thrown into a police wagon with a young American Nazi.  They stare each other down, exchange threats, stand steaming and streaming together in that quickest form of intimacy known as hatred. The Nazi begins the taunting:  '' 'You Jew bastard,' he shouted. 'Dirty Jew with kinky hair.'  ''They didn't speak that way. It was too corny. Yet he could only answer, 'You filthy Kraut.'  '' 'Dirty Jew.'  '' 'Kraut pig.' ''  Their insults run parallel, their stares converge:  '' 'Come here, you coward,' he said to Mailer, 'I'll kill you.'  '' 'Throw the first punch, baby,' said Mailer, 'you'll get it all.' '' Mailer writes: ''They were both absolutely right. They had a perfect sense of the other.'' Each was ready to brawl. And what if they should? ''In retrospect, it would appear not uncomic -- two philosophical monomaniacs with the same flaw -- they could not help it, they were counterpunchers.'' Then it is back to their inexorable, almost hilarious enmity.  Mailer's power and allure rest in his being, at once, self-surrendering and astringently assertive. Both qualities are present in the encounter with the Nazi. People who have the gift of melting into another nature usually need to assert themselves all the more so as not to melt away altogether. Actors, for example, often self-destruct because they turn their assertiveness inward, against themselves; Mailer, a sometime film performer and director, is fascinated by the actor's craft. His bellicose bravado seems to be a stay against the dissolving of his personality and -- not always successfully -- against self-induced harm.  ''They had a perfect sense of the other.'' Early on, Mailer understood that in a democracy in which the most radically different types of people are thrown together, a harmonious encounter with ''the other'' is an American dream (e.g., the national obsession with the Relationship), the reality of which often becomes an American nightmare (e.g., popular culture's obsession with crime). For the Brooklyn-raised, Jewish, middle-class Mailer, who once wrote about himself that there was ''one personality he found absolutely insupportable -- the nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn'' -- a perfect sense of the more extreme forms of otherness became artistic and intellectual mother's milk.  No surprise, then, that Mailer's previous novel, ''The Gospel According to the Son,'' in which he attempted to inhabit Jesus Christ, felt less like a creative vision than a head-butt against eternity. The material had a built-in obstruction to Mailer's gift of sympathetic self-surrender: Jesus was a nice, middle-class Jewish boy from Nazareth. Now Mailer has returned to the right side, which is to say, the wrong side, of the tracks.  ''The Castle in the Forest'' -- Mailer's first novel in 10 years -- is not just the almost superhumanly detached fulfillment of the somewhat depressed boast he made nearly half a century ago in ''Advertisements for Myself'': ''I wish to attempt an entrance into the mysteries of murder, suicide, incest, orgy, orgasm and Time.'' This remarkable novel about the young Adolf Hitler, his family and their shifting circumstances, is Mailer's most perfect apprehension of the absolutely alien. No wonder it is narrated by a devil. Mailer doesn't inhabit these historical figures so much as possess them.  In ''The Castle in the Forest,'' the devil-narrator -- who is living in the body of an SS man named Dieter -- tells a little tale about the tale he is telling. ''It is more than a memoir and certainly has to be most curious as a biography since it is as privileged as a novel. I do possess the freedom to enter many a mind.'' Those two sentences form the crux of Mailer's originality.  FOR Mailer, a novelist fanatically committed to the truth, the problem of the ego's relation to other people has been for many years now the problem of the narrator's relation to his material. In his eyes, writing must be an authentic presentation of the self.  As Mailer sees it, great writing puts before the reader life's harshest enigmas with clarity and compassion. ''The novelist is out there early with a particular necessity that may become the necessity of us all,'' he has written. ''It is to deal with life as something God did not offer us as eternal and immutable. Rather, it is our human destiny to enlarge what we were given. Perhaps we are meant to clarify a world which is always different in one manner or another from the way we have seen it on the day before.''  And once you have authentically presented yourself in your writing, you can no longer practice the expedience of concealing yourself as a person. So Mailer the man has -- sometimes not happily -- transgressed social norms, just as his books have crashed through the boundaries of alien identity and literary genre. Yet for all the cross-pollination between his art and his life, Mailer has always insisted on true art as a form of honest living. The writer, as he once put it, ''can grow as a person or he can shrink. ... His curiosity, his reaction to life must not diminish. The fatal thing is to shrink, to be interested in less, sympathetic to less, desiccating to the point where life itself loses its flavor, and one's passion for human understanding changes to weariness and distaste.''  Mailer has never, like the dandy, tried to live aesthetically. When he stabbed his wife at a party in 1960 and when he helped get released from prison a literarily gifted killer who then stabbed an aspiring young playwright to death, it was because he followed the wrong impulses, not the wrong ideas. He never committed the ugliness of insinuating that he screwed up for art's sake. He let the ugliness and the imprudence of his actions speak for themselves.  Mailer did heedlessly write -- in the notorious essay ''The White Negro'' (published in the democratic-socialist journal Dissent, a most decent, un-notorious little magazine) -- that the hypothetical murder of a middle-aged shopkeeper by two hoodlums was an example of ''daring the unknown,'' of ''trying to create a new nervous system,'' of ''looking for the opportunity to grow up a second time.'' It is widely assumed that Mailer was trying to shock the bourgeoisie with a sympathy for violence. But if you read the essay all the way through, you see that he was doing something else: trying to shock the respectable class with an imaginative inhabitation of the violent. Rather than advocating murder, Mailer was exercising his perfect sense of the other -- in this instance, ''the psychopathic personality'' that, he theorized, ''may indeed be the perverted and dangerous front-runner of a new kind of personality, which could become the central expression of human nature before the 20th century is over.'' Such wild empathy is an insult to the everyday solipsism of ''decent'' self-interest that sees evil and shrugs. Anyway, how many writers would dare to sacrifice the appearance of sanity for the sake of absolute emotional and intellectual transparency?  A truthful modern writer who possesses the shamanistic ''freedom to enter many a mind'' might choose to answer the hyperskeptical, Freudian-influenced modern reader's question: ''So who is doing the entering?'' In other words, what is the nature of this particular writer's authority? The postmodernists answer the question by installing layers of artistic self-consciousness inside the work itself. For decades, Mailer has been answering it existentially. ''We perceive the truth of a novel by way of the personality of the writer,'' he wrote in the introduction to ''The Time of Our Time,'' a selection of his work published in 1998. ''That is the flavor of fiction. We observe the observer.''  So, to allow readers to observe the observer, Mailer writes a novel followed by a nonfiction book that illuminates his state of mind behind the preceding novel; composes essays outlining obsessions that shape his fictions; makes a literal rendering, animated by the novelist's special clairvoyance, of a real event that Mailer himself lived through and acted in -- he swings (''for to swing is to communicate, is to convey the rhythms of one's own being to a lover, a friend or an audience'') from reports on boxing, Marilyn Monroe, the moon landing and John F. Kennedy, to polemics against feminism and scientific technology, to reflections on totalitarianism from the right and the left, to fiction about socialism, McCarthyism, Hollywood, high society, Lee Harvey Oswald, ancient Egypt and the C.I.A. Mailer's ambition to ''turn the consciousness of our time,'' as he once put it, drove the symbolic combustions of private and public life in his early novels ''Barbary Shore'' and ''The Deer Park.'' It's what incited him to run for mayor of New York in 1969.  This restless vastness of Mailer's ambition (''In motion a man has a chance'') is such that his ''failures'' are seminal, his professional setbacks groundbreaking. His willingness to fail -- hugely, magnificently, life-affirmingly -- expands artistic possibilities. Then, too, point to any contemporary literary trend -- the collapse of the novel into memoir; the fictional treatment of actual events; the blurred boundaries of ''history as a novel, the novel as history'' (the subtitle of ''The Armies of the Night'') -- and there is Mailer, pioneering, perfecting or pulling apart the form.  In fact, he has lived and written so impulsively that his life and his writing each need the other to be completed. That itself conveys a brutal honesty about the limitations of life, and of writing. Or as Mailer once wonderfully and bizarrely complained: ''It is not demanding to write about characters considerably more defeated than oneself since the writer's ego is rarely in danger of being punished by too much self-perception.'' In politics, this is called ''accountability.'' Mailer's emotional and psychological transparency make his work a kind of ersatz democracy.  One way to take the measure of a writer is by considering the weight, quality and consistency of his obsessions. Mailer, from the beginning, has had a rage for what he calls ''nakedness.'' It is a passion for emptying his psyche onto the table in front of the reader, much as a person who has just been arrested will be ordered by the police to empty his pockets as he is being booked.  Indeed, Mailer loves freedom so ambitiously that he is never free of the feeling of not being free. Here is Mailer in ''The Deer Park,'' a Hollywood tale so caustic and seemingly unmediated by art that reading it is, in places, like listening to Maria Callas become all the more vivid as Aida by vulnerably failing to hit her high notes: ''The unspoken purpose of freedom was to find love, yet when love was found one could only desire freedom again.'' Of the sudden fame and fortune that came to him with the publication of his first book at the age of 25, Mailer wryly recalled: ''My farewell to an average man's experience was too abrupt; never again would I know, in the dreary way one usually knows such things, what it was like to work at a dull job or take orders from a man one hated.'' His feeling that early success cut him off from vital, common experience may explain why he has kept diving so purposefully, and extremely, back into experience.  The inaugural book was ''The Naked and the Dead,'' and it was the first instance of Mailer's obsession with being ''naked'' in public.  Mailer originally used the title for a play based on his brief employment in a mental institution during his college years at Harvard. He chose it again for his epic tale about World War II, inspired by his service as a rifleman, among other duties, in the South Pacific. Nakedness in this novel means the dehumanizing process by which war's atmosphere of death strips soldiers down to their bare, defenseless essence as mortal beings. In war, men are returned to their original state; they are reborn helplessly into the world. Inter faeces et urinam.  But as his career evolved, Mailer began to invest the word with a contrary import. Nakedness came to mean the way Mailer the man and the writer bared his impulses, desires, instincts and thoughts -- mortality as a cry of defiance against mortality. Nakedness in public, saying the unsayable, becomes a form of power.  Mailer's divulgences involve writing about his envy, bitterness, selfishness and greed, about the effect of the slings and arrows rained down on his own lustful, fearful, grasping, always faltering, always charging ego. In ''Advertisements for Myself,'' Mailer rued the critic-inflicted wounds that resulted in ''three or four years of constipated work, lack of confidence, cowardly sweetness and bouts of churlishness''; took vicious measure of rivals like Bellow (''I cannot take him seriously as a major novelist''), Styron, Salinger and Baldwin, among others; and reprinted the belligerent inscription he'd written on a copy of ''The Deer Park'' that he sent Hemingway. Papa's failure to acknowledge it ''helped to push me further and deeper into the next half year of bold assertions, half-done work, unbalanced heroics and an odd notoriety of my own choice.'' Has any consequential American writer scoured himself so thoroughly and alarmingly in public? Mailer writes like a Puritan without a superego.  To Mailer's mind, such self-exposure earned him the entitlement to write about other people's envy, bitterness, selfishness and greed. This is how he addressed his Greenwich Village readers in 1956, in the first column he wrote for The Village Voice, which he had recently co-founded: ''That many of you are frustrated in your ambitions, and undernourished in your pleasures, only makes you more venomous. ... Nevertheless, given your general animus to those more talented than yourselves, the only way I see myself becoming one of the cherished traditions of the Village is to be actively disliked each week.'' He was probably right; still, that was one short-lived column. The assaults of his reviewers also justified Mailer's own ferocity in criticism. In his antifeminist tirade, ''The Prisoner of Sex,'' he lashes Kate Millet: ''The yaws of her distortion were nicely hidden by the smudge pots of her indignation.''  Baring your private demons in order to expose other people's -- including your rivals' -- has been for Mailer a type of anti-macho courage. He set out to map the dark underside of the American ego just as Hemingway had anatomized American nerve. In a country openly driven by self-interest and self-absorption, the ego's hidden bruises and connivings are too fundamental to be openly discussed.  Reflecting in the 1950s on his ''fear of homosexuality,'' Mailer wrote that ''I could kill this inhibition only by jumping into the middle of the problem without any clothes.'' That is, only by confessing his aversion and apologizing for it in print, which he did, bravely, in ''Advertisements for Myself.'' Nakedness again. Throughout his career, Mailer has eccentrically, 19th-centurily, associated any self-repression with death by cancer. (When Susan Sontag protested figurative interpretations of physical disease in ''Illness as Metaphor,'' she was, to a large extent, responding to Mailer.) Mailer is one of the last Western writers to create a self-contained intellectual universe out of strong, idiosyncratic convictions about the relationship between spiritual, psychic and social existence. In his autonomous creative world, heterosexual anal sex is the power-replenishing and very good (for the man) alternative to banal sex; masturbation is power-depleting and very bad; homosexuality is regrettable, but dignified; condoms are dreadful (a conclusion reached in the era before AIDS); and unprotected sexual intercourse between a man and a woman is What It Is All About. And that's just sex. According to Mailer, technology makes us strut like puffed-up little gods and sucks the air out of intellect and will.  Ours is an age of mockery and sarcasm, when even irony is belittled for being secretly sincere about its lack of conviction. People wring their hands over the Fate of the Novel, but no one seems comfortable with a novelistic approach -- i.e., a universalizing intuition expanding through a fresh perception -- in nonfiction. Mailer's theories are the hyperorganizing overflow of a novelist's mind, which by its nature leaps back and forth between intuition and experience. As he puts it, there is little he has written, ''even when it comes under the formal category of nonfiction or argument, that has not derived, then, from my understanding of how one writes fiction.'' And so, ''fiction, as I use the word, is a reality that does not cohere to received axes of fact but is breathed in through the swarm of our male and female movements about one another.''  To not cohere to received axes of fact -- magical phrase! -- to approach life novelistically, is to make connections between the visible and the invisible world, and to transfigure the commonplace. We now are drowning in mind-numbing literature of the commonplace: tipping points, hive minds, ''freakonomics,'' ''bobos in paradise'' -- it is all lifestyle trends, marketing techniques, cheap behavioral psychology and glib social-pattern-spotting. This flood of minutiae makes one long for Mailer's heroic attempts to invest experience with a higher meaning, no matter how far-out or unacceptable some of his connections between seen and unseen might be. Even if such notions offend household pieties, they have the effect of making you return fully awake to first principles that had begun to make you snore. And when Mailer's connections work, they are beyond good.  In his book about Marilyn Monroe, he wrote, ''Since sex is, after all, the most special form of human communication, and the technological society is built on expanding communication in much the way capitalism was built on the expansive properties of capital and money, the perspective is toward greater promiscuity.'' If you are seeking an explanation for why pornography takes up most of the Internet, there it is.  At the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Mailer observed that some of Mayor Richard Daley's ''Illinois goons'' had ''eyes like drills; others, noses like plows; jaws like amputated knees.'' Reporting on the Republican convention in Miami, in that same year, Mailer observed that Nelson Rockefeller ''had only one flaw -- an odd and unpleasant mouth, a catfish mouth, wide, unnaturally wide with very thin lips. In the center of the mouth there seemed almost another mouth which did the speaking.'' In all of these transfiguring passages, Mailer bores into familiar particulars and comes out on the other side with a poetic singularity.  This capacity to draw out new meaning from personalities and events may explain why Mailer is the only major American novelist to be really canny about politics. The subject worked Bellow up into sulfurous apocalyptics; it turns Updike coy and indifferent; it transforms savage, uncontainable Roth into a good old-fashioned Upper West Side liberal. But Mailer's wild empathy endows his vintage political writing with a wild, visceral prescience.  He understands, for example, that consummate insiders are often temperamental outsiders -- outlaws in the good or bad sense of the word. Here he is on John Erlichmann's testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee in July 1973, in which an outsider's character and dignity suddenly upended the insider's sordid malfeasance: ''He acted as if he were proud to be on the side he was on; his pride was what could not be suffered. For it spoke of a world whose real complexity could savage a liberal brain. Liberals could certainly live with the hot idea that they were fighting Mephisto's own Nixon, but they couldn't support the Kierkegaardian complexity that the good guys might be right next to the bad guys on the same team.'' A lesser writer would treat the insider/outsider paradox as merely a lesson in hypocrisy. For Mailer it is further proof that the world ''is always different in one manner or another from the way we have seen it on the day before.'' His grasp of power's myriad facets gives some of his political predictions a visionary accuracy.  Almost 40 years ago, in ''The Armies of the Night,'' Mailer characterized himself as a ''left conservative,'' thus envisioning a syncretic position that is now the holy grail of the best ideological aspiration. At the 1968 Republican convention, gazing at the legions of conservatives around him, Mailer realized that their faith ''existed in those crossroads between the psyche and the heart where love, hate, the cognition of grace, the all but lost sense of the root, and adoration of America congregate for some.'' He was the first serious liberal to take conservatives seriously -- that is to say, novelistically. At his best (his post-9/11 politics have taken a turn into a kind of forced occultism), he writes about America as though he were an expatriate living in a Beautiful Idea of America, from which exile he notates the shadowy degrees between ideal and real.  No political foresight of Mailer's can surpass the prediction he made in 1962, at the height of the cold war, in a debate with William F. Buckley Jr.: ''So let the true war begin. It is not a war between West and East, between capitalism and Communism, or democracy and totalitarianism; it is rather the deep war which has gone on for six centuries in the nature of Western man, it is the war between the conservative and the rebel, between authority and instinct.'' It was, he went on, ''the war we can expect if the cold war will end. It is the war that will take life and power from the center and give it over to left and to right, it is the war that will teach us our meaning.'' And he said this before the cultural conflagrations ignited by the '60s, which burn deeper and wider now.  One quality separates Mailer from many of his heavy-hitting contemporaries. He went to war. The Army revealed to Mailer the variety and breadth of American society. But war made him a storyteller who has a deep mistrust of narrative.  The sprawl and chaos of battle are not unlike the sprawl and chaos of a human life -- or on a larger scale, democracy itself. In ''The Naked and the Dead,'' Mailer wrote a classic narrative. But then, as though the war had gradually seeped through his nerves into his imagination, Mailer's novels slowly moved away from conventional plots and story lines. The stunningly compressed social-sexual symmetries of ''Barbary Shore,'' ''The Deer Park'' and ''An American Dream'' burst into the form-exploding streams of consciousness in ''Why Are We in Vietnam?'' and then were stretched into long, messy, fictionalized actual lives and events in the controlled chaos and sprawl of ''The Executioner's Song,'' ''Ancient Evenings'' (a flawed tour-de-force of alien inhabitation) and ''Harlot's Ghost.''  The greatest of these is ''The Executioner's Song,'' which tells the true story of Gary Gilmore, a man doomed to violence who spent half his life in jail and, upon his release, murdered two men in cold blood. Sentenced to death row, Gilmore could have staved off execution indefinitely by legal means, but instead tried to kill himself several times, defied his lawyers' attempts to appeal and finally insisted on being put to death by firing squad. The uncanny dynamic driving the book gradually shifts from portraying Gilmore as a violent mythomaniac at war with society, to depicting a ruthlessly mythologizing media at war with Gilmore's ragged soul, as Gilmore himself works the levers of mass spectacle. Once back in jail, the consummate outsider discovers he has an insider's temperament -- inside prison, having become a media sensation, he discovers the quiddity of America's madness.  With its breathtaking panorama sweeping from the country's small-time depths to its big-time shallows, ''The Executioner's Song'' was like ''The Naked and the Dead'' stateside -- or, given Mailer's heightened powers at the midpoint of his career, ''War and Peace'' translated into the Great American Novel. The book's sprawl made it the anti-''In Cold Blood'': where Capote pressed his real-life tale into a neat narrative, Mailer let his naturally respire through the billion pores of its accumulated, enveloping facts. The language is flat, smooth, shaved down, as if Mailer had produced his words by running a carpenter's plane over reality. It is the fulfillment of Hemingway's style: it has the same spare, unforgiving, unflinching neutrality, but without Hemingway's deliberate literary manner. In an inspired stroke, Mailer separates his paragraphs with a double space, making them the typographical equivalent of Gilmore's Utah County, where ''the desert was at the end of every street.'' The technique also lets him capture how American experience seems to consist of disconnected moments, each one possessing an isolated magnitude, as though you were advancing minute by minute into the future out of no past, from one eternal present to another.  In ''The Executioner's Song,'' Mailer at last found the right relationship of the narrator to his material. He completely effaces his personality, but because the environment he recreates brims with his much publicized themes and obsessions -- sex, violence, power, repression, displacement; all in the pursuit of happiness -- the story itself becomes an actor in Mailer's pre-existing universe. The novel is free of his presence and full of his presence, overtly self-surrendering and subtly self-assertive, written not in the first- or third- but in a kind of spectral fourth-person. Mailer the author becomes as simultaneously real and unreal as Gilmore -- as America itself.  For all that, the bounty of ''The Executioner's Song'' is its compassion: neither sentimental nor judgmental; large-hearted in its poise and reserve. The book has no marginal or ''flat'' characters. Each figure possesses the roundness of his or her real life. Perhaps that's why so many sentences in ''The Executioner's Song'' begin with a proper name or pronoun. The overflowing force of Mailer's egotism endows him with respect for the power and capacity of other people's egos. But his rarest and most precious quality is that he is able to see the most alien people in the familiar way they see themselves. Which brings us to Mailer's new novel.  Toward the end of ''The Castle in the Forest,'' Dieter, the novel's devil-narrator, imagines a question from the reader: ''Dieter, where is the link to your text? There is a lot of forest in your story but where is the castle?''  Dieter replies that in German ''The Castle in the Forest'' is das Waldschloss, a name, he says, that some Jews gave to the particular concentration camp in which they were imprisoned. In fact, Dieter explains, ''Waldschloss sits on the empty plain of what was once a potato field. Not many trees are in sight, nor any hint of a castle. Nothing of interest is on the horizon. Waldschloss became, therefore, the appellation given by the brightest of the prisoners to their compound. One pride maintained to the end was that they must not surrender their sense of irony. That had become their fortitude. It should come as no surprise that the prisoners who came up with this piece of nomenclature were from Berlin.''  Dieter's weird and unique riff on the nature of German irony follows, and for the sake of understanding this richly enigmatic book it has to be quoted in full: ''German came to us originally as the language of simple folk, good pagan brutes and husbandmen, tribal people, ready for the hunt and the field. So it is a language full of the growls of the stomach and the wind in the bowels of hearty existence, the bellows of the lungs, the hiss of the windpipe, the cries of command that one issues to domesticated animals, even the roar that stirs in the throat at the sight of blood. Given, however, the imposition laid on this folk through the centuries -- that they be ready to enter the amenities of Western civilization before the opportunity passes away from them altogether -- I do not find it surprising that many of the German bourgeoisie who had migrated into city life from muddy barnyards did their best to speak in voices as soft as the silk of a sleeve. Particularly, the ladies.'' He adds: ''To every sharp German fellow, however, particularly the Berliners, irony had to become the essential corrective.''  The Castle in the Forest'' is a story about simple folk and good pagan brutes from the muddy barnyard, a tale narrated by a devil whose voice is soft as the silk of a sleeve, and written in the spirit of a corrective irony. The young Adolf Hitler, his parents, siblings, stepsiblings and extended family are stuck in the sty of their instincts, immediate gratifications, primitive fears and terrors, yet nearly each of them -- the men, especially -- feels that he is living a noble, honorable, admirable life.  Mailer the wild empathizer, the maestro of the human ego, is keen and blunt about these delusions -- what, in effect, are the deceptively homey psychological origins of evil. At one point the devil says: ''We are keyed to look for excess of every kind,'' and ''every exaggeration of honest sentiment is there to serve our aims.'' Elsewhere he notes: ''People had to be wary of feeling too saintly, since they could not be certain of the source of such feelings. They could be working for Satan.'' And also: ''Rare was the man or woman who did not possess an intense sense of the injustice done to them each day. It was our taproot to every adult. It was a fury in every child.'' The ''ability to wall up the most unpalatable facts about oneself will always elicit my unwilling admiration.''  These walled-in sentiments produce in the Hitlers (their name passed through various changes) the delusion that their conscience inhabits a castle, when in fact, they are so subject to the primal ooze of their feelings that they resemble trees fixed in nature's irresistible forces. ''The Castle in the Forest'' is an intricately constructed novel, and one of its recurrent motifs is the explicit comparison of people to trees. The devil finds the ''taproot'' to his clients. After (unforgettably described) sex with Adolf's future father, Alois Schicklgruber, Hitler's future mother, Klara Poelzl, experiences a guilt that is ''as heavy as a waterlogged tree.'' Another character is ''bent by now as a tree that has faced too much wind for too many years.'' At one point, Mailer potently describes woods in which there were ''not too many tortured shapes to suggest the aftermath of crazy storms when the trees were young.'' In a travesty of nature and procreation, the young Adolf Hitler likes to masturbate on leaves.  Somewhere along the line, Dieter remarks on ''that curious human nature, which forces its way into existence between the hazards of urine and excrement, yet will later dream each night of a noble life.'' Inter faeces et urinam, another of this novel's themes, is a further twist on ''nakedness'' and on mortal helplessness. These tree-people remain stuck infantlike in the waste amid which they were born -- Alois, the pathologically womanizing customs official; Klara, his wife and niece, who hides in the folds of escapist religious piety her instinctive knowledge that she is in fact Alois's daughter; Adolf, whose onanistic sessions are like ''being shot out of his own cannon.'' They are all -- spiritually, emotionally and mentally -- as naked as the day they came into the world. In the case of Adolf, he will defensively transmute his naked helplessness into a perverted egotism: the terrible power that he will wreak on other human beings.  Mailer is pretty faithful to the outlines of Hitler's life, though for some reason he makes Adolf's sister Paula retarded, when in reality she was not. (Nor was there ever a concentration camp referred to as Waldschloss.) Mailer does take two considerable liberties. He gives Hitler only one testicle, and makes him the product of father-daughter incest. Rumors of both began circulating after Hitler's suicide in 1945; Mailer makes actual what no one can prove or disprove. The incest is essential to Mailer's purpose. Ever since Wagner celebrated the brother-sister coupling of Siegmund and Sieglinde in ''Die Walk\u00fcre'' -- a superlove greater than piddly human morality, etc. -- some Nazis had thrilled to the idea of hatching the master race in the family rec room, a disagreeable impulse they then projected outward onto their image of depraved, incestuous Jews.  For Mailer, incest represents the sick inversion of everything he cherishes: expansion of the self beyond one's origins; the gift of empathy with the other; the ability to sublimate love into work and vice versa. Even the Hitler family's most strenuous attempt at the last backfires. Alois's passion to redeem his life with work as a beekeeper turns disastrously into a warped lesson in crushing utilitarianism and social control -- a lesson not lost on young ''Adi.'' Nature itself, unresisted by an enlightened human will, backfires. The real ''castle'' is the repulsive parody of a castle: the squalid hut of a master beekeeper called Der Alte, a sadist and child molester who is the most consequential of Adolf's twisted mentors.  Insofar as the forest represents natural goodness (Mailer beautifully has the devil suggest that ''even processed paper still contains an ineluctable hint of the tenderness God put into his trees'' ), ''forest'' and ''castle'' are, you might say, the two poles of Mailer's work and life. The popular conception of Mailer sees only the former: unrestrained expression of impulses and instincts; sex as freedom; absolute candor as ineluctable hint of God's presence. But Mailer is also an immensely disciplined craftsman and stylist who has spent the larger portion of his life working at the writer's trade. He is a castle builder expert in the different paths along which people can wander and become lost in a forest without a castle, and yet trick themselves into thinking that they inhabit a resplendent fortress or chateau. Perhaps in some subtle way, he wants in this late novel to make clear the difference between tortured, and mostly sublimated, obsession with sex and violence -- a nice Jewish boy's boxing match with repression -- and the compulsive sex and violence that are the true mark of a repressed nature.  Over the gates to Auschwitz hung a sign that said, with inhuman irony, ''Arbeit Macht Frei.'' Work makes you free. By titling his castle-less book ''The Castle in the Forest,'' Mailer has created, with infinitely human irony, the inner story of the deluded minds that, inadvertently and not, laid the road that led to Auschwitz. Some critics may exaggerate Mailer's occasional easy moral equivalences, and his handful of dog-eared, though hardly invalid, allusions to the diabolical nature of art. They may also mistake the presence of his hallmark obsessions for narcissistic anachronism -- in which case they will not only fail to enjoy the devil's fabulous cadenza on bad odors and the nature of evil, but be blind to the role of sexuality in human history. They will also miss the profound moral engagement of this book. Mailer has imagined himself into a raw propinquity to evil without losing either his nerve or his humanity. He uses his sense of the other to inhabit people devoid (except for the otherworldly Dieter) of his other-apprehending gift.  There is no weary celebration of the demonic here, no facile declaration of evil's universal latency. Mailer, who believes in God and the Devil the way Greeks and Romans believed in meddling supernatural rivals, has never had sympathy for the Devil, and he has none here. ''Our aim, after all,'' Dieter says of Satan's purposes, ''was to keep reducing human possibilities.'' Far from being a smooth minion of dapper Mephistopheles, Dieter is, for one thing, an awful storyteller. To readers unwilling to have the novel interrupted by Dieter's account of his assignment to the coronation of Nicholas II in Russia -- Mailer's Tolstoyan reimagination of that time and event -- Dieter says sloppily: ''Just turn to Page 261. Adolf Hitler's story will pick up again right there.'' Mailer has contempt for this devil, surpassed only by his loathing for young Adolf. Yet Mailer is also in awe of the devil's multifarious nature. Dieter coquettishly insinuates that he wishes to betray Satan and go over to the side of the ''Dummkopf,'' a name Satan insists his legions call God so as to conjure a derisive image of a being who has a great, magnetic claim on their respect. (Mailer would be a fearsome adversary in the arena of office politics.) It is Dieter's very complexity -- ''real complexity could savage a liberal brain'' -- that inflames Mailer and which he thus conscientiously evokes. Dieter says, ''Yet is it not also true that one cannot find a devil who will not work both sides of the street?'' The use of a triple negative to express evil's protean and malleable nature, with its echo of Christ being thrice denied, is itself a multifarious malediction on evil, rising into art from the heave and toss of Mailer's temperament. Alone among American writers, Mailer has earned the right to use a triple negative. So let it be said, once and for all: Norman Mailer is a rebellious angel who never fell. Whoever told him that he has fallen, got it; in the words of the younger Mailer to that other type of Nazi, they got it all. They are getting it again, in this utterly strange work of naked, wild empathy.  ",

                    "text": "  Though the programs that Leon Botstein devises for the AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA often have a professorial tinge, they can be genuinely intriguing. Sunday afternoon, for example, he conducts ''Pioneering Influence: C\u00e9sar Franck.'' The Frenchman Franck, often thought of as a 19th-century also-ran, is presented here as a powerful influence upon French composers who followed him, including Ernest Chausson, Paul Dukas (of ''Sorcerer's Apprentice'' fame) and the little-known Alb\u00e9ric Magnard. The program concludes with Franck's stormy Symphony in D minor. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $27 to $55.  This week the WEILL MUSIC INSTITUTE AT CARNEGIE HALL presents a workshop with the eminent German organist and conductor HELMUTH RILLING. A chorus of volunteers, auditioned and prepared by Kathy Saltzman Romey, will be rehearsed and conducted by Mr. Rilling in a performance of Bach's ''St. Matthew'' Passion on Saturday night, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's and a roster of vocal soloists. Saturday at 7 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $25 to $82.  ERNST KRENEK'S ''REISEBUCH AUS DEN \u00d6STERREICHISCHEN ALPEN'' (''Diary From the Austrian Alps''), a major song cycle inspired by Schubert's ''Winterreise,'' is seldom performed, let alone complete. Krenek (1900-91), the Austrian modernist composer, has yet to get his due. So this concert on Tuesday in the intimate hall of the Austrian Cultural Forum is timely. The tenor Volker Vogel performs, accompanied by the pianist Ann Beckman. 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300; free, but reservations required.  The kinetic conductor ZUBIN MEHTA, once the music director of the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, is back leading the orchestra in a work that will test his profundity, Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. The program includes Elgar's Cello Concerto with the brilliant young Alisa Weilerstein as soloist. Thursday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $28 to $96.  Finally, for a jolt of the new, head downtown to the Kitchen for two performances by the adventurous contemporary music ensemble EIGHTH BLACKBIRD. Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; $10.  ",

                    "text": "  The Bush administration lowered its estimate of the cost of Medicare's new prescription drug benefit Saturday, saying the price tag had come down about 10 percent in the last six months.  Administration officials said they hoped the numbers would undercut support in Congress for a Democratic proposal requiring the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical makers to secure lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.  The 2003 Medicare law prohibits such direct negotiations, relying instead on private insurers and their agents to seek discounts on prescription drugs. Legislation to repeal that ban is a top priority for the new Democratic majority in Congress.  Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said the new numbers showed that such legislation was unnecessary because competition among private plans had effectively held down costs.  ''Our new estimates provide clear evidence that consumer choice is working,'' Mr. Leavitt said in an interview. ''Government interference will result in fewer choices and less consumer satisfaction.''  Such arguments are unlikely to sway House Democrats, who say older Americans are still paying far too much for medications. But the numbers provide new ammunition for Republicans.  In July, the Bush administration estimated that payments to private plans offering the Medicare drug benefit would total $1.077 trillion from 2007 to 2016. Officials now estimate they will be $964 billion.  The federal government subsidizes premiums and pays a variety of subsidies to insurers to draw them into the Medicare market.  Leslie V. Norwalk, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said drug costs in general had been increasing more slowly than expected. In addition, Ms. Norwalk said, enrollment in the new Medicare program is lower than expected, because some beneficiaries found they had equivalent drug coverage from other sources.  ",

                    "text": "  MANY signs point to a growing historical consciousness among the American people. I trust that this is so. It is useful to remember that history is to the nation as memory is to the individual. As persons deprived of memory become disoriented and lost, not knowing where they have been and where they are going, so a nation denied a conception of the past will be disabled in dealing with its present and its future. ''The longer you look back,'' said Winston Churchill, ''the farther you can look forward.''  But all historians are prisoners of their own experience. We bring to history the preconceptions of our personalities and of our age. We cannot seize on ultimate and absolute truths. So the historian is committed to a doomed enterprise -- the quest for an unattainable objectivity.  Conceptions of the past are far from stable. They are perennially revised by the urgencies of the present. When new urgencies arise in our own times and lives, the historian's spotlight shifts, probing at last into the darkness, throwing into sharp relief things that were always there but that earlier historians had carelessly excised from the collective memory. New voices ring out of the historical dark and demand to be heard.  One has only to note how in the last half-century the movements for women's rights and civil rights have reformulated and renewed American history. Thus the present incessantly reinvents the past. In this sense, all history, as Benedetto Croce said, is contemporary history. It is these permutations of consciousness that make history so endlessly fascinating an intellectual adventure. ''The one duty we owe to history,'' said Oscar Wilde, ''is to rewrite it.''  We are the world's dominant military power, and I believe a consciousness of history is a moral necessity for a nation possessed of overweening power. History verifies John F. Kennedy's proposition, stated in the first year of his thousand days: ''We must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient -- that we are only 6 percent of the world's population; that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind; that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity; and therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.''  History is the best antidote to delusions of omnipotence and omniscience. Self-knowledge is the indispensable prelude to self-control, for the nation as well as for the individual, and history should forever remind us of the limits of our passing perspectives. It should strengthen us to resist the pressure to convert momentary impulses into moral absolutes. It should lead us to acknowledge our profound and chastening frailty as human beings -- to a recognition of the fact, so often and so sadly displayed, that the future outwits all our certitudes and that the possibilities of the future are more various than the human intellect is designed to conceive.  Sometimes, when I am particularly depressed, I ascribe our behavior to stupidity -- the stupidity of our leadership, the stupidity of our culture. Three decades ago, we suffered defeat in an unwinnable war against tribalism, the most fanatic of political emotions, fighting against a country about which we knew nothing and in which we had no vital interests. Vietnam was hopeless enough, but to repeat the same arrogant folly 30 years later in Iraq is unforgivable. The Swedish statesman Axel Oxenstierna famously said, ''Behold, my son, with how little wisdom the world is governed.''  A nation informed by a vivid understanding of the ironies of history is, I believe, best equipped to manage the tragic temptations of military power. Let us not bully our way through life, but let a growing sensitivity to history temper and civilize our use of power. In the meantime, let a thousand historical flowers bloom. History is never a closed book or a final verdict. It is forever in the making. Let historians never forsake the quest for knowledge in the interests of an ideology, a religion, a race, a nation.  The great strength of history in a free society is its capacity for self-correction. This is the endless excitement of historical writing -- the search to reconstruct what went before, a quest illuminated by those ever-changing prisms that continually place old questions in a new light.  History is a doomed enterprise that we happily pursue because of the thrill of the hunt, because exploring the past is such fun, because of the intellectual challenges involved, because a nation needs to know its own history. Or so we historians insist. Because in the end, a nation's history must be both the guide and the domain not so much of its historians as its citizens.  Op-Ed Contributor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who has won Pulitzer Prizes for history and biography, is the author, most recently, of ''War and the American Presidency.''  ",

                    "text": "  The quincea\u00f1era photo hangs high up on the living room wall: Wanda Reynoso, at 15, in a sparkling white dress and a tiara, radiant against the pink backdrop.  Ms. Reynoso, now 18, is still the same beautiful girl, but underneath her cocoa skin, her color is yellow and pale.  Subdued and gracious, Ms. Reynoso is fighting a disease that has left her exhausted; the treatments she undergoes have been like a battle.  She has aplastic anemia, a disorder of the bone marrow that causes it to stop producing red and white blood cells, and platelets. ''The inside of the bone is, like, empty,'' she said. ''I'm not producing blood or any type of cells.''  The disease compromises her ability to fight infections. Her bones and joints ache. She is at risk of uncontrolled bleeding. ''If I get a bruise, I got to tell him real quick,'' she said of her doctor's strict instructions.  ''Sometimes I don't even want to wake up,'' she said. ''I feel my body so tired, so heavy. I don't even want to get up from the bed.''  In August, she began chemotherapy at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx, but it was discontinued in October because her body was not responding.  She needs a bone marrow transplant and is waiting for a compatible donor. Neither her mother nor her brother is a match. On Tuesdays and Fridays she takes two trains and a bus from her Bronx apartment to the hospital for blood transfusions. She receives two bags each visit, and the process takes about four hours and leaves her exhausted.  Her doctors worry that public transportation will expose her weakened immune system to infections, but she has no other way to get to the hospital and back. It reassures her that her mother, Fatima Sanchez, goes with her.  If she needs to, Ms. Reynoso can sleep on the train.  No parent could be prepared for such a frightening illness in a child, but for Ms. Sanchez, this has been particularly devastating.  Three years ago, Ms. Sanchez, 44, moved her son, Gregory Reynoso, now 15, and Ms. Reynoso from the Dominican Republic to the Bronx. When Ms. Reynoso became ill, Ms. Sanchez left her restaurant job to care for her daughter full time.  ''Not being able to work has not been easy,'' Ms. Sanchez said in Spanish. ''There have been times when I feel very desperate.'' Her salary was the family's only income. They are legal residents, not citizens, and the family does not qualify for public assistance.  Ms. Reynoso's grandmother and aunts, also in the Bronx, pay the $642 monthly rent on their one-bedroom apartment.  Then there is the language barrier. Ms. Sanchez does not speak English and often relies on her daughter to translate medical information.  ''There's days when she's not even up to speaking, so when she's not up to it, what information does Mom get?'' asked Minerva Cales, a social worker. Ms. Cales works at Ms. Reynoso's high school for the Children's Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  In late September, Ms. Cales noticed that Ms. Reynoso, a senior and a strong student, was missing a lot of school. When she learned about the illness behind the absences, Ms. Cales did what she could to help.  Ms. Cales used $1,570.80 in Neediest Cases money for a variety of items: a sofa bed and armchair for the living room; $200 in clothing vouchers ; $80 in MetroCards; $90.89 to pay the bill on a cellphone, which is the family's only phone; and $200 in food vouchers.  With Ms. Cales's help, Ms. Reynoso now has Medicaid, and can be treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, Ms. Cales said, Ms. Reynoso can be added to a list for a bone marrow donor. Now that she is 18, she is above the age limit at the Children's Hospital, Ms. Cales said.  Ms. Reynoso continues her school work at home, with daily visits from a home educator, and a computer borrowed from the school. ''Even with the illness, she's still up to date on her schoolwork,'' Ms. Cales said.  When Ms. Reynoso talks about dancing, she still sparkles. ''I was the Shakira of the school,'' she said. She won the title after dancing in a school talent show, when she showed off some moves inspired by the pop performer.  Now, Ms. Reynoso's brother sometimes has to carry her up the stairs to their fourth-floor walk-up.  ''She's a senior at school this year, we're hoping that she's able to be there at graduation,'' Ms. Cales said. ''That's my goal.''

                    "text": "  At the Final Four in Boston last April, the North Carolina women's basketball team saw a night full of promise dissolve into a disquieting mess.  The top-seeded Tar Heels lost in a semifinal to Maryland, which went on to win the national championship against Duke. North Carolina guard Ivory Latta said the flight home was filled with quiet tears.  Weeks and months passed, and Latta refused to watch the film from that game.  But on Friday, as the undefeated Tar Heels prepared for Sunday's game against Maryland, North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell figured the time was right. Her players sat and stomached last season's end.  ''Man, it was depressing,'' Latta said. ''It was very hard to watch.''  But Latta said the film was also helpful. The players noticed simple mistakes they had made and vowed not to repeat them. At the Comcast Center on Sunday, the second-ranked Tar Heels took their long-awaited shot at the No. 3 Terrapins. This time, they walked off the court delighted, with an 84-71 victory that snapped Maryland's 19-game home winning streak before a crowd of 17,950 that was the largest to attend an Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season women's game.  ''Playing against North Carolina, playing against Duke, the revenge factor is so, so big right now,'' said Maryland forward Laura Harper, whose team lost to Duke, 81-62, on Jan. 13. ''They come ready to play us.''  For a time, North Carolina's victory looked as if it would come easily. The Tar Heels (23-0, 7-0) raced to a 20-point second-half lead behind the shooting of Latta, who made six 3-pointers and finished with 32 points.  But Maryland (21-2, 5-2) responded with a furious comeback that was led by the senior guard Shay Doron, who scored 13 of her 19 points in the second half. With 3 minutes 13 seconds left, Doron converted a 15-footer, pulling the Terrapins to 67-66.  ''She just kept putting them up, making shots and all,'' Hatchell said. ''But, you know, that's Maryland; I knew they could score like that.''  The Tar Heels, who entered the game as the nation's top-scoring team, can pounce quickly, too. They closed the game with a 17-5 run, and revenge was theirs.  When Maryland, Duke and North Carolina reached the Final Four last season, it was the first time a conference had placed three teams in the national semifinals; the A.C.C. had never sent more than one.  This season, the three A.C.C. powers have a combined record of 65-2, with the two losses coming within their impressive triumvirate. Maryland plays host to Duke on Feb. 18 but will not face North Carolina again in the regular season. North Carolina plays host to Duke on Feb. 8 before visiting the Blue Devils on Feb. 25.  Sunday's game became a sellout more than two weeks ago. The atmosphere and the national-television audience might have caused some early-game jitters for the Terrapins. Maryland missed 15 of its first 18 field-goal attempts and committed 10 turnovers in the first 10 minutes.  ''Anxiousness, nerves, whatever you want to call it,'' Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. ''But at the same time, we have played on the biggest stage before.''  With 30 seconds remaining in the first half and North Carolina leading, 33-27, Maryland guard Kristi Toliver was hounded by two defenders as she struggled to bring the ball across midcourt. Frese stomped the floor and yelled to a referee, frustrated that a foul had not been called. She received a technical foul, and Latta made both free throws, giving the Tar Heels an 8-point halftime lead. Latta made four 3-pointers in the first 4:50 of the second half, putting North Carolina ahead by 20.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Although it has been a decade since the Museum of Modern Art's giant Jasper Johns retrospective, there have been a spate of smaller shows devoted to aspects of his work. Now the National Gallery of Art in Washington has put its own spin on his oeuvre with ''JASPER JOHNS: AN ALLEGORY OF PAINTING, 1955-1965,'' which opens today.  Not wanting it to seem like either another retrospective or a survey show, Jeffrey Weiss, the gallery's curator of modern and contemporary art, has traced this artist's work through four motifs: the target, the mechanical device, the stenciled naming of colors and the imprint of the body.  Included in the show will be 84 works from public and private collections, including the largest group of target paintings ever assembled. Among them is ''Target With Plaster Casts'' (1955), which is the image on the cover of the show's catalog. It has been lent by David Geffen, the entertainment mogul. Also on view will be many of Mr. Johns's most famous works, like ''False Start'' (1959), which now belongs to the Chicago collector Kenneth C. Griffin, and ''Jubilee'' (1960). Through April 29; nga.gov.  An exhibition devoted to another popular American artist, ROBERT GOBER, opens Saturday at two of the Matthew Marks Galleries in Chelsea. Like Mr. Johns, Mr. Gober is known for using familiar vernacular American forms in his work.  Consisting of only new works -- two sculptures and several drawings -- the exhibition will feature a sculpture of a plastic milk crate filled with sculptures of Granny Smith apples that rests on a cast of a wooden footstool in the space at 526 West 22nd Street. A block away, at 521 West 21st Street, will be a second cast of a wooden footstool, this one made with an old packing blanket folded on the seat. Through March 10; (212) 243-0200.  ",

                    "text": "  Introduced on Sunday: Acura Advanced Sports Car design study  Is it real? The mechanical bits are all present, and the body is metal, not Styrofoam. But Acura's Advanced Sports Car Concept is strictly a nonrunning prototype, with its doors and hood sealed for the run of the auto show.  What's the point? The NSX was Acura's two-seat halo car, an Asian Ferrari that served as a showcase of technology and innovation. Since its demise, Acura's parent, Honda, has been hard at work on a replacement to keep the performance fires burning.  What they said: ''I must tell you that my own passion is performance,'' Takeo Fukui, president and chief executive of Honda Motor Company, said.  What they didn't say: That this is the next NSX, or that Acura is overdue for something more potent than the brand's current crop of V-6 engines. The next episode in the hunt for NSX V2.0 occurs at the Tokyo auto show, in October 2007.  What makes it tick? The A.S.C.C. has a front-mounted V-10 coupled to sport-tuned version of Acura's all-wheel drive hardware.  How much, how soon? No one would let us peek under the hood, much less mention anything as vulgar as a price or when to expect this car to be production ready.  How's it look? The Advanced Sports Car Concept looks familiar -- we see a lot of Audi R8, minus the gaping grill, and the Lexus LF-A concept of 2005, in this Acura's front end. It could probably do with an extra dose of edginess when the second iteration appears in Tokyo.  ",

Two newborn babies, their mother and a grandmother were killed in a roadside bombing in eastern Afghanistan as they were returning home from the hospital on Sunday, said the provincial police chief of Khost, Muhammad Ayub, who called the attack ''inhuman.'' Three others in the car, a woman and two men, were wounded, he said.  In a separate attack, gunmen on a motorcycle killed a high school headmaster in the southern province of Helmand as he was walking home from morning prayers at his local mosque, according to an Interior Ministry spokesman.  American soldiers thwarted a suicide car-bomb attack on their outpost in the eastern province of Paktika on Saturday. The troops began shooting at the advancing vehicle, and it crashed into an outside barrier and exploded, according to a NATO statement. Five soldiers were wounded, and the bomber was killed.  A NATO soldier was also wounded in a roadside explosion in Kandahar Province on Saturday, a NATO spokesman said.  More than 600 civilians have been killed in the past three years, including those killed as a result of operations by NATO, American and Afghan troops as well as attacks by the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission reported Sunday. The commission appealed for the military to take more care to avoid civilian casualties and called for compensation to be given to the victims' families.  ",

Mondello their state chairman on the heels of an election in which Republicans took a historic drubbing, Mr. Mondello, in a flash of candor, said he was taking over a party that had hit rock bottom.  ''We've got almost no place further down that we can go,'' Mr. Mondello, the longtime Nassau Republican chairman, said in an interview that day.  Now, a little more than a month but a political eternity later, it appears Mr. Mondello may have spoken too soon.  Never mind that Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate leader and, with the end of the Pataki era, the most powerful Republican in the state, has since disclosed that he is under federal investigation for his outside consulting work.  With a new Democratic governor, Eliot Spitzer, reaching across party lines in late December to name a Republican, State Senator Michael A. L. Balboni of East Williston, to head up homeland security, Mr. Mondello is abruptly facing a bruising special election in his home base to fill Mr. Balboni's seat. Mr. Spitzer will set the date for the election, probably for early to mid-February.  If a Democrat wins the northwestern Nassau district, where Democrats hold a slight registration edge, it would be a major embarrassment for Mr. Mondello, the first chipping away of the Republican grip on all nine State Senate seats for Long Island. It would also further narrow the slender majority Republicans hold in the Senate.  But if a Republican wins, Mr. Mondello would gain luster. And if Mr. Bruno, who chose Mr. Mondello for state chairman, were forced out, Mr. Mondello has close ties to the heir apparent, State Senator Dean G. Skelos, of Rockville Centre.  Anthony Santino, a spokesman for Mr. Mondello, said last week that no decision had been made on a candidate. But Mr. Mondello's widely expected choice is Maureen O'Connell, 56, of East Williston, a former registered nurse and lawyer who served in the State Assembly from 1999 to last January, when she took over as Nassau County clerk.  Ms. O'Connell did not answer calls to her office. Mr. Santino said Mr. Mondello was unavailable. ''We're certainly going to wage a very aggressive campaign to keep the seat Republican,'' Mr. Santino said.  Jay S. Jacobs, the Nassau Democratic chairman, said Mr. Spitzer's landslide election on a reform platform gave local Democrats momentum. He said federal scrutiny of Mr. Bruno would be an issue. ''Joe Mondello was handpicked by Joseph Bruno, so you do the math,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''Their candidate would be critical of Bruno at his or her peril.''  Craig M. Johnson, 33, of Port Washington, who is a third-term Nassau County legislator and whose district is within the senatorial district, was seen as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination.  Mr. Johnson, a lawyer with a practice in bankruptcy and commercial law, earned notice in March when he endorsed Mr. Spitzer for governor at a time when Nassau's top Democratic official, County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, was seeking the office. Mr. Johnson declined to comment last week on his candidacy.  Other leading candidates are Michelle Schimel, the North Hempstead town clerk, and Matthew Cuomo, a cousin of State Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo and nephew of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Nassau County Legislator Roger H. Corbin and Rocco Iannarelli, the North Hempstead tax receiver, were also on the list. State Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli of Great Neck could also emerge as a candidate unless Mr. Spitzer names him to succeed State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned last month in an ethics scandal involving misuse of state money to chauffeur his wife.  Desmond Ryan, a veteran political lobbyist, said Mr. Spitzer's reform initiatives and Mr. Bruno's legal situation played strongly to the advantage of the Democrats. ''Their candidate will be able to say, 'Elect me and I will help you reform state government,' '' he said. He added that Long Island Republicans ''never do well in special elections.''

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''Bumping in Schools'' (editorial, Dec. 27):  As a veteran teacher in private schools, I was delighted when the school district in Philadelphia negotiated to allow some schools to practice on-site selection of teachers instead of the seniority placement system described in your editorial.  What had kept me out of public urban education was the prospect of teaching at a school whose faculty and administration were not reform-minded. I wanted my efforts to be supported, but under the seniority-based system of placement, my desire to be part of positive change was irrelevant.  Why would a well-meaning principal try to be a reformer? He or she would have no hand in selecting the faculty.  I now work with like-minded colleagues and administrators in a Philadelphia public school, but it was possible only when an alternative to the seniority-based placement system was created.  Matthew C. Baird  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  To the Editor:  Finding teachers for the neediest classrooms is a challenge for many school districts.  Regrettably, and all too often, assignments to these positions are seen as the ''dues'' new teachers must pay before they can work their way through the system and transfer to schools considered to be more desirable.  One way to curb this trend would be to limit the percentage of novice teachers that can be assigned to high-needs schools and to provide a higher level of support for beginning teachers in these positions.  It would also help if schools serving the neediest children were directed by experienced and highly qualified administrators.  Howard Miller  Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is an associate professor of literacy education at Mercy College.  To the Editor:  The ''bumping'' process that you describe is bogus.  The seniority rule regarding assignment to a school is: if a vacancy occurs, it is filled by seniority. Even this procedure has been watered down by the site-selection process, in which teachers must interview for a vacant position and seniority plays no part.  The idea that teachers change schools willy-nilly at their own choice is a myth.  John Jaros  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is a teacher.  ",

                    "text": "  A racing pulse, a tendency to startle at loud noises, nightmares and flashbacks -- these are the familiar symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. But a new study suggests that combat veterans who suffer from the disorder may also be at increased risk for heart attacks and fatal coronary heart disease.  The study is the first to suggest that the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or P.T.S.D., may actually be a cause of heart disease. And the more severe the symptoms of P.T.S.D., the researchers found, the greater the risk for disease.  The analysis was based on data from 1,946 veterans participating in a continuing study. The men, whose average age at the start of the study was about 62, had no pre-existing heart problems. Beginning in 1986, they were followed for more than 10 years, with periodic physical examinations and the updating of their medical records. Two self-administered scales were used to assess the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and to estimate their severity.  Over the course of the study, which appears in the January issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, 255 of the men developed either nonfatal heart attacks, fatal coronary heart disease or angina pectoris, the chest pain associated with heart problems.  The number and severity of the veterans' symptoms were significantly associated with nonfatal heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease, and somewhat less strongly linked to angina.  These results, the authors suggest, mean that people with more symptoms of the stress disorder are not simply prone to reporting aches and pains but actually at higher risk for disease.  ''In this sample, symptom levels were actually low to moderate,'' said Laura D. Kubzansky, the lead author and an assistant professor of society, human development and health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''So the fact that we have evidence of risk at these levels means that at even higher levels of symptomatology, where people might be significantly distressed and meet diagnostic criteria for P.T.S.D., you would expect to see even higher levels of risk.''  The exact mechanism through which post-traumatic stress might affect heart health is not known, but some researchers have suggested that the stress-caused release of hormones called catecholamines may lead to injury of the coronary arteries by altering blood flow or setting off chemical changes in the body. These hormones may also encourage the release of fatty acids that can be harmful to the heart.  The new study, the authors say, is the first to demonstrate an association between heart disease and symptoms of post-traumatic stress while controlling for many of the variables that might affect risk, including depression, smoking, a family history of heart disease, cholesterol levels and alcohol consumption.  The researchers acknowledge that the study's findings pertain largely to older white men who served in the military and therefore cannot be generalized to women, nonwhite men or civilians. Also, the data on psychological symptoms (although not on heart disease) depend on self-reports by the veterans rather than on interviews by doctors, and therefore may be less reliable.  The fact that the researchers determined the presence of post-traumatic stress before the onset of any heart disease strengthens the findings, they said, because it eliminates the problems of recall bias, when people erroneously attribute an illness to some unconnected event or anxiety in the past.  For a long time, Dr. Kubzansky said, people have assumed that those with anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder were simply more likely than others to report pain, and that the pain might not be real.  But the new findings, she continued, ''suggest that there are significant cardiotoxic effects of these disorders beyond just a sense of discomfort or pain.  ''We should be concerned about P.T.S.D. because it's a bad outcome in and of itself,'' she said. ''But this makes an even stronger argument that we should pay attention to those who have it to make sure they don't develop further problems down the road.''  ",

                    "text": "  Mos Def  ''True Magic'' (Geffen)  If you happen to get as far as ''Fake Bonanza,'' one of the last few tracks on Mos Def's third solo release, you'll hear this Brooklyn rapper-turned-actor offer his appraisal of modern hip-hop: ''Flossy and raw/so self-absorbed/immature /I can't remember being this bored.''  Fair enough, except that boredom seems to guide this bleary hangover of an album. Mos Def may not be flossy or raw at this stage in his celebrated career, which is fine. But what he offers instead is lukewarm nostalgia and obligatory indignation. Songs like ''Thug Is a Drug,'' ''Crime & Medicine'' and ''Murder of a Teenage Life'' carry urgent messages upfront, but not much depth within. Mos Def may care, and he may deliver tantalizing flashes of lyrical skill, but he doesn't inspire much feeling other than listless dread.  The music may be partly at fault. With production by Preservation, Minnesota and Pharrell, ''True Magic'' often sounds scraped together on the cheap. (The album's laughably bare-bones packaging reinforces this impression.) There are a few soulful moments, like the back-to-back tracks ''There Is a Way'' and ''Sun, Moon, Stars,'' each featuring a blandly appealing singsong exhortation. But it's nowhere near enough.  And Mos Def seems to know it. He ends ''Fake Bonanza'' with a series of halfhearted mumbles that culminate in a defensive-sounding affirmation: ''It makes no difference what people say.'' Then he punctuates that thought with what almost sounds like a yawn.  NATE CHINEN  ",

                    "text": "  TWO weeks ago, President Bush called for a long-term plan to increase the size of the armed forces. As our leaders consider various options for carrying out Mr. Bush's vision, one issue likely to generate fierce debate is ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the policy that bars openly gay service members from the military. Indeed, leaders in the new Congress are planning to re-introduce a bill to repeal the policy next year.  As was the case in 1993 -- the last time the American people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly gay men and lesbians should serve in the military -- the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides. The debate must be conducted with sensitivity, but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14 years.  When I was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I supported the current policy because I believed that implementing a change in the rules at that time would have been too burdensome for our troops and commanders. I still believe that to have been true. The concern among many in the military was that given the longstanding view that homosexuality was incompatible with service, letting people who were openly gay serve would lower morale, harm recruitment and undermine unit cohesion.  In the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve. President Bill Clinton, who promised to lift the ban during his campaign, was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition, which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take. The compromise that came to be known as ''don't ask, don't tell'' was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve.  The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much evidence suggests that it has.  Last year I held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines, including some with combat experience in Iraq, and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew. These conversations showed me just how much the military has changed, and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers.  This perception is supported by a new Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people. And 24 foreign nations, including Israel, Britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism, let gays serve openly, with none reporting morale or recruitment problems.  I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces. Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.  But if America is ready for a military policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, the timing of the change should be carefully considered. As the 110th Congress opens for business, some of its most urgent priorities, like developing a more effective strategy in Iraq, share widespread support that spans political affiliations. Addressing such issues could help heal the divisions that cleave our country. Fighting early in this Congress to lift the ban on openly gay service members is not likely to add to that healing, and it risks alienating people whose support is needed to get this country on the right track.  By taking a measured, prudent approach to change, political and military leaders can focus on solving the nation's most pressing problems while remaining genuinely open to the eventual and inevitable lifting of the ban. When that day comes, gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are, and the military will no longer need to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose.

                    "text": "  ABC sees fewer ongoing, serialized dramas in its future, and at least one of its biggest shows -- the megahit ''Lost'' -- is heading toward a definite end.  Stephen McPherson, the president of ABC Entertainment, told a meeting of television writers here on Sunday that after the experience of several failed or mediocre new serials this year -- including ''Day Break,'' ''The Nine'' and ''Six Degrees'' -- the network has fewer of those types of shows in development.  And for ''Lost,'' the biggest of the ABC serials, the network is now discussing with the producers how and when to end the series, Mr. McPherson said.  Damon Lindelof, one of the executive producers of ''Lost,'' said that the show's creators had always viewed it as lasting about 100 episodes, and that he still believes that will be the case. Fifty-three episodes have been broadcast so far, with the show in its third season, meaning that it is likely that the fifth season will be the last.  ''We're no longer going up the hill,'' Mr. Lindelof said. ''We're starting to come down now.''  Mr. Lindelof also said that while ABC has the ability to extend the series as long as it wants, with different producers and even different stars, he believes that the network is unlikely to do so.  ''We don't want to produce those episodes of 'Lost,' and we are not going to,'' Mr. Lindelof said. He cautioned against such a move, pointing out that as series like ''The X-Files'' and ''Alias'' extended their runs by making dubious creative decisions, their ratings suffered greatly as fans abandoned the shows in droves.  He said the network and the producers would announce the decision soon after it is made, to make sure that fans understand that the show has a definite endpoint, and that outstanding questions about the mysteries of the island will be answered.  But there also was some good news for ''Lost'' fans.  Mr. McPherson said it is unlikely that viewers will have to weather another extended midseason hiatus. The network has been criticized by fans for running six ''Lost'' episodes last fall, then breaking for almost three months before resuming the series next month for 16 straight weeks.  Mr. McPherson said he believes that the next season will run for 22 consecutive weeks, either in the fall of 2007 or the spring of 2008. Production requirements and scheduling necessities caused ABC to break up the series this season, he said.  ABC also said it will present a fourth season of ''Dancing With the Stars,'' its hit ballroom-dance competition, on Monday nights beginning on March 19. The network decided not to schedule the competition installments of the series directly against ''American Idol,'' which runs on Tuesday nights, although the results show for ''Dancing'' will be seen at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, going up against at least a portion of ''Idol'' on some nights.  As for future serial shows Mr. McPherson said that the experience of the network's current season, with several bad showings for new serials, indicated that audiences have a limited ability to absorb such shows. After the initial success of ''Lost'' and Fox's ''24'' several years ago, a lot of television production companies put new serials into development, with many of them on at the same time, as they did this year.  ''We're going to see an adjustment this year because people in the fall were able to see whether or not there was a burnout,'' Mr. McPherson said. ''We're seeing a little bit of a shift away from that.''  ",

                    "text": "  The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying rules, overcoming bipartisan reluctance to ban many of the favors that lobbyists do for lawmakers and to illuminate the shadowy legislative practice of earmarking money for special projects.  The Senate's action makes the start of the 110th Congress a watershed moment in the history of K Street and Capitol Hill. Interpreting the results of the Nov. 7 election as a reaction to corruption scandals when Congress was under Republican control, the Senate has joined the House in adopting broad new rules that go beyond the proposals Republicans introduced last year, the ones that Democrats campaigned on, or the extensive changes House Democrats recently passed.  The measure passed around 9 p.m. by a vote of 96 to 2. Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, both Republicans, were the only members to vote against the bill.  On Wednesday, Senate Republicans nearly derailed the bill in a dispute over when the Democrats would agree to vote on a Republican proposal, a version of the line-item veto. At a news conference Thursday, a half-dozen Democratic senators competed to belittle the Republicans' line-item veto as ''an excuse,'' ''a ploy,'' ''a subterfuge,'' a ''rabbit out of a hat'' and ''a grand act of ethics hypocrisy.''  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the leader of the new Democratic majority, threatened to postpone any action on ethics until the next election and publicly blame the Republicans if they did not allow a vote Thursday.  But by Thursday evening, Mr. Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had resolved the impasse. They agreed to hold a vote on the line-item veto as part of a minimum-wage debate next week.  ''This legislation has been extremely difficult to deal with,'' Mr. Reid said Thursday night. ''It is difficult because it deals with our lives.''  ''In the short-term, the reforms in this bill may take some getting used to,'' he added, ''but in the long term, we'll be thankful we took these steps.''  Like the new House rules, the Senate bill bars members from accepting gifts, meals or trips from lobbyists or the organizations that employ them. It ends the use by senators of borrowed corporate jets at discount rates.  Also like the House rules, the Senate measure requires disclosure of the sponsors, the purpose and the cost of the pet projects, or earmarks, that lawmakers have been able to tuck anonymously into complicated spending bills.  Unlike the House, the bill would also explicitly prohibit earmarks that would benefit the immediate family of the senator who sponsored it. Many of those changes revise internal Senate rules and do not require House or presidential approval.  Senate Democrats also incorporated into the bill a provision that, if signed into law, would require for the first time that lobbyists disclose the most valuable favors they do for lawmakers: holding campaign fund-raisers, soliciting campaign contributions and bundling checks from clients and friends.  Of all the bill's provisions, it was the disclosure requirements for bundled checks that met the stiffest resistance behind the scenes in the Democratic caucus because of the potential to make it harder for incumbent lawmakers to tap K Street lobbyists as surrogate fund-raisers, aides involved in negotiations over the bill said, speaking anonymously because the talks were confidential.  Addressing another loophole in campaign finance laws, the Senate bill would also bar lobbyists or their employers from giving parties to honor lawmakers at party conventions. House Democrats say they plan to take up the subject of lobbying rules on their side of the Capitol in the next several weeks.  The party leaders began by teaming up to introduce a much weaker bipartisan bill, and lawmakers in both parties acknowledged behind-the-scenes resistance to strengthening it. But many found amendments to strengthen the bill -- a number of them offered by Senators Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin and Barack Obama of Illinois, both Democrats -- politically difficult to oppose.  Fred Wertheimer, president of the ethics group Democracy 21, said, ''These are always difficult battles, but when you get them on the floor you get votes of 96 to 2.''  The bill became a pivotal test for Mr. Reid in his new role trying to manage the Senate. He is a frequent target of Republican accusations of fraternizing with influence-peddlers. Several members of his immediate family have worked as lobbyists, although he says that none have lobbied his office, and he is among the biggest recipients of the discounted use of corporate jets for travel.  Mr. Reid promised vigorous reform as his first act as majority leader. He offered an amendment to bar lawmakers from accepting the discounted use of corporate jets.  But when a Republican senator offered an amendment to match the House's earmark disclosure rules, Mr. Reid miscounted the votes he had on his side when he tried and failed to table the measure. Mr. Reid first argued against moving too fast to match the House Democrats' new rules and then embraced the same idea with token modifications.  Mr. Coburn, one of the two ''no'' votes, said he had been troubled by a lack of openness in the negotiations over the contents of the bill. Senators Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat who is recovering from health problems, and Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, were absent and did not vote.  ",

                    "text": "  The sites were not glamorous -- a raceway in Yonkers, a union hall in Hauppauge on Long Island, the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Wash. -- and the pay was not great, either. He earned anywhere from $50 to $12,000 per fight, and sometimes a night at a discount motel and a day's worth of meal vouchers.  Still, Kemal Kolenovic loved the fighting life unequivocally. At age 28, his record was fairly unremarkable: 10 victories, 6 losses and 2 draws with nine years under his belt as a professional boxer. But even those numbers, if looked at a certain way, owed something to an attitude that valued enthusiasm over rigor and reduced the science of a boxing match to youthful play.  ''He was an all-out brawler, not much of a technical boxer, but he had a blast just throwing punches, and he was good at it,'' said Tony Kalaj, a friend who works for Joe DeGuardia's Star Boxing, a fight promotion company. ''The record? It was hard for him to get fights with his style. He made opponents look stupid.''  Two days ago in the Bronx, Mr. Kolenovic was killed after a barroom brawl in which the police said he had not participated. Sometime after 4:30 a.m. on Sunday, he was run over by a man driving a sport utility vehicle. The man was fleeing the Moonlight Restaurant and Bar on Belmont Avenue, where he and others, but not Mr. Kolenovic, had argued over which Albanian surnames were most associated with tougher and generally superior people.  The men had taken the fight outside. Mr. Kolenovic, who was at the Moonlight with an uncle, Tony Mujovic, 35, had eventually followed them onto the sidewalk and joined a group that had gathered, perhaps just to see what was going on or perhaps, Mr. Mujovic said, to try to get them to break it up. One of the men climbed into a dark sport utility vehicle and plowed into the crowd. The driver fled, and the police said last night that he was still at large.  The S.U.V. hit Mr. Kolenovic and threw him headfirst into a tree. He was pronounced dead shortly afterward at St. Barnabas Hospital.  ''We sat around reviewing what the security camera got,'' said Al Kolenovic, a cousin. ''You see Kemal sitting outside, wanting to leave. The poor guy's got his hands in his pockets, with his back to the car. He didn't know what hit him.''  Yesterday at midday, three or four dozen men who said they were cousins of Mr. Kolenovic gathered in Astoria, Queens, at the Islamic Unity and Culture Center of Plav-Gusinje, a Muslim mosque that serves the city's Montenegrin community.  About half of them sat around folding tables in the basement; the rest spilled outside, onto the corner of 12th Street and 31st Avenue. They were long-faced and mostly with dark hair, and a good number of them smoked cigarettes in the rain. The women in their lives -- sisters, spouses, mothers -- were inside, upstairs with scarves over their heads, kneeling in front of prayer mats.  ''Right now, it's the women's turn,'' Al Kolenovic said. ''And then the men again. Both groups do it five times a day until the deceased has his burial. Pretty sad story.''  He said the burial was to take place today at a Balkan cemetery in Monticello, N.Y., pending the approval of the boxer's mother, Sanija Kolenovic. She flew from her home in Germany and was due to arrive at the mosque at any minute.  Several friends from the boxing community had been by to pay their respects, including Elvir Muriqi, an Albanian whose boxing nickname is the Kosovo Kid. Joe Antonacci, a ring announcer, described Mr. Kolenovic as ''a beautiful person in a brutal, lonely, thankless game.''  ''He had such charisma in the ring,'' Mr. Antonacci went on. ''He looked like Brian Setzer from the Stray Cats -- that blond hair combed back. He had a big Albanian following, obviously. But he couldn't go into an arena and not make fans. He was a nonstop movement fighter, fast hands, lots of spirit.''  Mr. Kolenovic fought as a welterweight. He was 5-foot-7 and weighed about 150 pounds. He came to Brooklyn from Montenegro in 1993, when he was 14 or 15, without his parents. He worked construction and washed dishes in restaurants to pay rent. He lived in Midwood.  Mr. Kolenovic worked with a few trainers in his career. The last was Chelo Betancourt, who worked with him at Gleason's Gym in Dumbo.  ''He was such a tough kid, a lot of championship fighters liked to spar with him because he could take it and he could adjust his style to match any fighter,'' Mr. Betancourt said. ''Antonio Diaz brought him out to Texas when he was training for a title fight, paid him $150 a day to stay out there and spar for a few weeks.''  In 2003, Mr. Kolenovic beat Fontaine Cabell for the New York State welterweight title. ''The promoters were looking for a walkover opponent, but we prepared good,'' Mr. Betancourt said. He said that Mr. Kolenovic won by technical knockout ''by counterpunching the whole way,'' and that ''he shocked everybody.''  The following year, Mr. Kolenovic lost his title defense, also by technical knockout. Mr. Betancourt said that he was underprepared because he had been spending more time drinking with friends than in the gym, and that he had advised him not to take the fight when he did.  At times, said Mr. Kalaj, the promoter: ''They threw him in with the wolves. He got robbed a lot by hometown referees.''  Around 3 p.m. yesterday, the car driving Mr. Kolenovic's mother pulled up at the mosque. She sobbed as she was escorted inside and up the stairs. When she approached her son's body in the open coffin, she clutched her head, dropped to her knees, and screamed.  All the men upstairs stood at the side of the room, while the women surrounded Mr. Kolenovic's body, also crying. Mrs. Kolenovic, who cried the loudest, took her son's face in her hands and held it.

                    "text": "  When overweight people lose weight, they often lose bone mineral density as well, increasing their risk for osteoporosis. But new research suggests that losing weight with exercise rather than calorie restriction can preserve bone strength.  Scientists randomly assigned 48 healthy, non-obese people in their 50s to three groups for a one-year study. The first group reduced calorie intake by 16 percent in the first three months and then 20 percent for the rest of the year. The second increased daily energy expenditure -- exercise, in other words -- by 16 percent in the first three months and then by 20 percent for the following nine months, carefully tracked by trainers using heart rate monitors. A control group was monitored without being assigned a diet or exercise program. The results appear in the Dec. 11 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.  The diet group lost an average of about 17 pounds; the exercise group about 14 pounds. But the people on the low-calorie diet also lost bone mineral density -- more than 2 percent at the spine, hips and leg. Those in the exercise group experienced no significant change in bone density, and the controls lost neither weight nor bone density.  The authors acknowledge that their sample was not large and did not examine sex differences in bone mineral density responses.  Dr. Dennis T. Villareal, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, recommends diet and exercise together in a weight-loss program. ''That way, you get the weight loss benefits of the diet,'' he said, ''but prevent the negative effect on bone health.''  VITAL SIGNS: ON THE SCALES  ",

                    "text": "  In promising to stop Iran from meddling in Iraq, President Bush returned Wednesday night to a strategy of confrontation in dealing with Tehran, casting aside what had been a limited flirtation with a more diplomatic approach toward it.  Mr. Bush accused Iran of providing material support for attacks on American troops and vowed to respond. ''We will disrupt the attacks on our forces,'' he said in his speech. ''We will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq.''  Mr. Bush said the United States would send another aircraft carrier and its supporting ships to the Persian Gulf. Administration officials said the battle group would be stationed within quick sailing distance of Iran, a response to the growing concern that Iran is building up its own missile capacity and naval power, with the goal of military dominance in the gulf.  Mr. Bush also announced the deployment of Patriot missiles to protect America's gulf allies. A battery of such missiles is already in Qatar, having been moved there several months ago.  The more combative talk reflects increased frustration in the administration with Iran, which American officials blame for part of the rising death toll in Iraq.  Military officials in Baghdad say they have documented a gradual rise in the number of sophisticated roadside bombs using ''shaped charges'' -- a type of weapon that commanders believe is imported from Iran. According to military statistics, 78 coalition troops were killed and 243 were wounded by these bombs between September and December of last year, compared with 53 killed by the bombs in the previous nine months.  American officials have provided members of Congress information to support the claim that Iran is helping to orchestrate attacks on Americans in Iraq, but the administration has not made that information public.  The American officials say that the Revolutionary Guard's Quds force trains inside Iran and then dispatches operatives into Iraq, using contacts with Iraqi Shiite militias to attack American troops.  ''They're training to kill coalition forces,'' said one senior American counterterrorism official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Their comments about wanting to see a stable Iraq are belied by this type of activity.''  Gen. Michael V. Hayden, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told Congress late last year that while he was originally skeptical of reports of Iranian operations inside Iraq, he now had the ''zeal of a convert'' on the matter.  One American official who recently returned from a trip to Baghdad said American commanders in Iraq believed that Iran was using its vast political influence to press Shiite politicians not to forge any long-term agreements with Sunnis.  ''We caught them with their finger in the cookie jar last month,'' a senior administration official said, referring to the arrest of five Iranians in Iraq whom the Americans accused of running guns and planning sectarian attacks. The Iranians were eventually released by Iraqi authorities.  American officials maintain that the latest moves should not be seen as preparations for a military strike against Iran. But they also said that Mr. Bush's top deputies, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley, had decided that, barring some major conciliatory move from Tehran, American moves to engage Iran had run their course.  The United States has grown frustrated with what one administration official described as the ''molasseslike'' pace of diplomatic efforts at the United Nations to impose broad sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.  The Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 with sanctions intended to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes but the United States and some European nations contend is for the purpose of creating nuclear arms. The measure bars the trade of goods or technology related to Iran's nuclear program.  But American officials acknowledge that the resolution is too weak to force Iran to abandon its nuclear program and are seeking to increase economic and psychological pressure on Iran. The United States is pressing governments and financial institutions in Europe, Japan and China to cut some of their financial ties with Iran.  For instance, during talks in Washington last week between Ms. Rice and visiting Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi of China, American officials urged Beijing to abandon a proposal for a $16 billion natural gas deal for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation to develop Iran's North Pars gas field, American officials said. The Chinese assured the United States that a decision was not imminent, American officials said.  Mr. Bush is expected to seek to apply pressure to other countries to limit their dealings with Iran in the coming month. American officials are hoping that the economic pressure will also persuade Iran not to actively oppose the new Bush strategy in Iraq.  THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ  ",

                    "text": "  A new study suggests that having many siblings may increase the risk for certain stomach cancers and that younger siblings may be more at risk than older ones.  Researchers gathered blood samples from 7,429 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii from 1967 to 1975 to determine whether they were infected with Helicobacter pylori, a childhood infection known to increase the risk for stomach cancer much later in life. They followed the men for 28 years, during which 261 developed gastric cancer.  From that group, the researchers selected the cases of those infected with H. pylori -- 239, or 92 percent -- and compared them with a group of cancer-free, but also infected, controls. The team then looked at family size and birth order in both groups.  Among the cases with the most the virulent strain of H. pylori, called cagA, those from families with seven or more children were more than twice as likely to develop cancer as those from families with one to three children, and younger children had a higher risk than older ones.  The study appears in the January issue of PloS Medicine.  ''It's remarkable that something that's happening in the early years of life affects the risk of a cancer happening seven decades later,'' said Dr. Martin J. Blaser, the lead author and a professor of medicine at New York University. ''It's my hypothesis that this may be a model system for other cancers.''  The authors acknowledge that some factor other than family size or birth order may be the cause of the findings. But they suggest that the germ is transmitted among siblings, and that the immature immune systems of younger children may make them more susceptible.  VITAL SIGNS: AT RISK  ",

According to Nielsen's estimates, ''Heroes'' led ''24'' by 20 percent among adults 18 to 49, and had 14.8 million viewers, compared to 14.4 million for ''24.'' NBC ranked first for the night in the 18-to-49 set as its game show ''Deal or No Deal'' (17.6 million) easily won the 8 p.m. hour over Fox's ''Prison Break,'' which drew a season-high of 9.9 million viewers. Despite ranking third for the night among adults 18 to 49, CBS managed to finish first in total viewers. Its sitcom ''Two and a Half Men'' outdrew ''Heroes'' and ''24'' in its half-hour at 9 (16.1 million), while ''CSI: Miami'' (18.7 million) dominated the 10 p.m. hour. ABC was fourth over all.

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  In his review of Florence Noiville's biography of Isaac Bashevis Singer (Dec. 24), D. T. Max quotes from Saul Bellow's English translation of Singer's ''Gimpel the Fool'': ''I had seven names in all: imbecile, donkey, flax-head, dope, glump, ninny and fool.'' This, he claims, sounds ''more like Augie March than someone from the old country,'' and he ''wonders'' about what Singer may have thought.  It is surely relevant to note that Bellow's English is a close and direct translation of Singer's Yiddish. The fact is that Yiddish speakers in the ''old country'' had plenty of words for fool, and presumably many occasions to use them. Singer's seven examples, each well rendered by Bellow, far from exhausted the storehouse. If you look in Nahum Stutchkoff's Yiddish thesaurus of 1950, published by YIVO, you will find 11 dense columns under the heading ''narishkayt.''  Paul Needham  Summit, N.J.  ",

These boxy-looking new minivans are the long-awaited fifth generation production models. Really.  What's the point? Though sales are fading quickly, minivans are still relatively big sellers at the Chrysler Group, which essentially invented the segment 24 years ago.  What they said: In a poke at Ford and General Motors, Thomas W. LaSorda, chief executive of the Chrysler Group, said, ''If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen -- we're about to turn up the heat in the minivan kitchen.''  What they didn't say: The minivan segment has never really recovered from Chrysler's killing of Plymouth and the very popular Voyager minivan in 2001. Minivan-based crossovers are the next big thing.  What makes it tick? Either a 3.3-liter flexible-fuel V-6 bolted to a four-speed automatic transmission, or choices of a 3.8- or a 4.0-liter V-6 (with 240 horsepower) coupled to a minivan-first six-speed automatic.  How much, how soon? The new minivans should start around $20,000 and top out at $40,000 loaded (with geegaws like swiveling seats, plug-in tables and two separate DVD systems) when they appear this fall as '08 models.  How's it look? The interiors are high-tech and very entertaining. The exteriors? Yawn.  FIRST GLANCE  ",

It's nothing like the Mexican flatbread of the same name, but is closely related to an Italian frittata, a thick round omelet layered with potatoes and onions. In Spain it is a tapas bar staple, served either warmed or at room temperature.  Though a good tortilla is not difficult to prepare, to simplify feeding a crowd there are now frozen ones. The El Forno brand from Spain, which is sold at Agata & Valentina, comes in a nine-inch size that will serve six to eight ($10.99), and with spinach or peppers in a seven-inch size to serve four ($9.99). The tortillas take 10 minutes to heat in a microwave or conventional oven or in a skillet with a cover. Sangria anyone?  FOOD STUFF  ",

PATRIOTS' DEFENSE  In the teams' first meeting, the Jets' offensive line gave up four sacks in a 24-17 loss. In the November rematch, the Patriots were without the injured Ty Warren, their stellar left end. In his absence, the Jets were successful running the ball, gaining 117 yards on the ground (65 more than in the first game) en route to a 17-14 victory. Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork expects to return after missing three games with a sprained ankle. He will be a handful for Jets center Nick Mangold, who has been nursing a left thigh injury. The other rookie on the Jets' line, D'Brickashaw Ferguson, faces the difficult task of slowing the Patriots' right end, Richard Seymour, who has 4 sacks and 40 tackles.

                    "text": "  As fighting began to flare Sunday around Kismayo, in southern Somalia, the final redoubt for the country's diminished Islamic movement, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.  Muhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.  ''We told them that they were going to lose,'' Mr. Arab said, ''and that our city would get destroyed.''  Kismayo, a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the East African spice empire, has been spared the fighting so far. But the Islamists, Mr. Arab said, did not care. ''These guys are bent on war,'' he said.  The fighting started around 5 p.m., with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib, a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo.  [Residents of Kismayo told Reuters Monday that Somali Islamists fled overnight from their final stronghold around the southern port of the city. Several thousand Somalia Islamic Courts Council fighters had been making a last stand north of Kismayo port, but residents said they melted away after the advancing Ethiopian force began its shelling of Jilib. Somalia's interim government vowed to pursue them.]  As the shells began to rain down in Jilib, residents said, clan militias in Kismayo turned on the Islamists.  That set off running gun battles across the city, with several people reported killed. It also accelerated the exodus from Kismayo, with thousands of residents hastily gathering a few belongings and joining the stream of people fleeing the fighting in southern Somalia.  It is hard to predict what is going to happen next. Local support for the Islamists in Kismayo is obviously evaporating, just as it did last week in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, when clan elders decided that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.  That led to the city falling much faster than anyone expected into the hands of Somalia's transitional government, which has used Ethiopian troops and airpower to reclaim much of the country. Clan elders are the pillars of Somali society, and many of the Islamist fighters in Mogadishu were clan militiamen lent to the movement.  But the fighters in Kismayo may be different. Kismayo is where the Islamist leadership fled after losing Mogadishu, taking their most steadfast and hard-core fighters.  Ethiopian officials have said that the Somali Islamists are bolstered by several thousand foreign fighters -- from Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Libya and Eritrea, Ethiopia's bitter enemy, though American intelligence officials have said that the numbers are far fewer, most likely in the hundreds.  Diplomats are still searching for a way to avert disaster. On Sunday, Kenyan officials, with American encouragement, continued to meet in Nairobi with the few remaining moderate leaders of the Islamist movement in an effort to reach a cease-fire. But the talks were slow-going, said an official close to the parties.  In Mogadishu, the transitional prime minister, Ali Mohammed Gedi, seems to relish his newfound authority. Mr. Gedi, a bookish veterinarian whom few Somalis would have recognized before last week's stunning comeback by the transitional government, is holding daily news conferences, meeting with clan elders and surveying bombed-out buildings for future office space. On Sunday, he reassured the populace in confident tones that the era of warlord rule was over.  ",

                    "text": "  The Roman Catholic Church leadership of Poland called Friday for all of the country's bishops to be investigated for past ties to the secret police.  ''We will ask a special commission to check the past of all our bishops,'' the Council of Bishops' chief, Jozef Michalski, told reporters in Warsaw after the episcopate's 45 bishops held an emergency meeting to deal with the worst crisis to hit the Polish church in years. It culminated last Sunday, when Warsaw's archbishop of just two days, Stanislaw Wielgus, resigned after admitting that he had collaborated with the reviled Communist-era Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service.  Newspapers digging into archives of the secret police have followed with reports that other senior clergymen were once collaborators. The Rev. Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski, who has researched the subject, is about to come out with a book naming 39 priests, including three bishops, who collaborated with the secret police between 1944 and 1989.  The scandal, which has already tarnished the Catholic Church's image as an unimpeachable moral authority during the Communist years, has caused chaos in a church already divided between liberal and conservative camps.  ''The situation is so difficult, it would be impossible for the bishops to stay silent,'' the Rev. Jozef Kloch, the spokesman of the bishops' council, said on Friday. He said the bishops were discussing a systematic way of dealing with the files.  The revelations have embarrassed the Vatican, which has complained that Bishop Wielgus misled Pope Benedict XVI about the depth of his ties until the Polish news media published his file.  But the Polish church, together with the Vatican under Pope John Paul II, a Pole, has been criticized for keeping collaboration among the clergy quiet -- even though it was widely known inside the church that up to 10 percent of priests, monks and nuns had some contact with the Polish secret police.  Even after the news media began revealing cases of collaboration after John Paul died, the Polish church chose to treat the matter internally.  With Archbishop Wielgus's resignation, the scandal has forced the church to be more aggressive. It is not clear what the church will do with bishops it finds collaborated.  ",

Using a $37,250 matching grant from the state's Environmental Protection Fund, the town hired a consultant to oversee the plan and appointed a steering committee, composed of representatives from local governments as well as environmental, civic and community groups.  The eastern waterfront includes commercial, residential and town property. The study will address issues like improving public access and establishing connections between downtown and the community; providing easier public access to the waterfront and the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Park and Beach; and providing easier access for transient boaters to downtown.  John Venditto, the town supervisor, said the plan was ''the last piece of a puzzle'' to protect the area's environmental resources and preserve the community character with sensible economic growth. He said that in the past 10 years the town had received $8.5 million in grants from the state for studies and work on waterfront projects -- a western waterfront plan and an Oyster Bay hamlet plan.  The western waterfront plan includes a 9/11 memorial park, a new fishing pier and the eventual replacement of two buildings at a shipyard that were razed. The hamlet plan includes new street lighting and paving and redesigned storefronts.  LINDA SASLOW  THE WEEK  ",

                    "text": "  The Nets squandered double-digit leads in the fourth quarter and lost each of their first two games of their trip out West, a reflection of their inability to maintain a steady course this season.  The letdowns, 1-point defeats to the Sacramento Kings on Monday night and the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, came on the heels of a four-game winning streak that had the Nets at .500 for the first time in two months. They have followed each apparent turning point this season with a misstep.  With their season past the midway point, the Nets (20-22) were still trying for their first road victory against a Western Conference opponent when they played the Los Angeles Clippers (20-21) on Thursday night.  After the game against the Warriors, ''the mood was not good,'' Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said Thursday morning. ''If you're a competitor, as a player or as a coach, you're very upset about that, about losing two games like that, games that you had in hand.''  Perhaps most disheartening for the Nets is that their five-game trip was getting more difficult. They play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night and the Utah Jazz on Monday.  ''Virtually every game, we're playing a better team,'' Thorn said. ''We've got our work cut out for us.''  Against the Kings, the Nets held a 20-point lead in the third quarter, only to have it evaporate at the hands of Sacramento point guard Mike Bibby, who capped a strong fourth quarter by making the winning shot with 10 seconds remaining.  ''We just quit playing,'' Thorn said. ''We just stood around in the fourth quarter.''  The Nets led the Warriors by 11 points with a little more than four minutes remaining, but Golden State finished the game on a 17-5 run, capped by guard Monta Ellis hitting the winner at the buzzer. It was the seventh time this season the Nets had lost after squandering a double-digit lead.  ''It is hard,'' Nets forward Bostjan Nachbar said after the game. ''It is not easy. We had both games won. We thought we were the better team, at least most of the game. We lost the game down the stretch, and the next couple games will show how tough we are.''  The Nets' grit will have to start with their two stars, Jason Kidd and Vince Carter. That is especially true with their third top-flight player, Richard Jefferson, out for about six weeks after he had arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle Monday.  Kidd has been stellar all season, playing some of the best basketball of his career, but he had eight turnovers against the Warriors.  Carter, after leading by 214,000 votes the last time they were counted, was surpassed in the All-Star voting by the Washington Wizards' Gilbert Arenas for an Eastern Conference starting spot Thursday. Arenas beat out Carter by 3,010 votes, the smallest margin in 17 years. Carter has been voted a starter six times.  Before Thursday night's game, Carter pretended to have thought he had beaten out Arenas. After sarcastically acting as if his feelings were hurt, Carter said he would not be disappointed to go the game as a reserve.  ''It's still an honor to be involved in it,'' he said.  For now, Carter has more pressing things to think about. He scored only 8 points against the Kings. Despite having 23 points and a career-high 13 assists against the Warriors, he did not dominate down the stretch.  The injuries to Jefferson and center Nenad Krstic, who is out for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, have probably affected Carter more than any other player because he faces more double-teams.  As the Nets have struggled this season, Carter has seemed to be the most likely candidate for a trade if Thorn chooses to make drastic changes. Carter can opt out of his contract at the end of the season, meaning the Nets may try to get someone in return for him if they feel he may leave.  But with the Nets' recent success -- they had won 9 of 11 games before losing to the Kings and the Warriors -- much of the trade talk seemed to have settled.  The Nets' ability to make any significant trades by the Feb. 22 deadline could be hampered by the fact that two of their biggest assets, Jefferson and Krstic, are injured.  ''When you're talking about trading, you trade from assets,'' Thorn said. ''If you don't have a lot of assets to trade, it's difficult to make anything but a minor trade.''  BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Wendy's International is unexpectedly changing agencies after working since August 2002 with two New York agencies that are part of the McCann Erickson Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Wendy's spends about $300 million a year on local and national advertising in major media.  Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, becomes the lead creative agency, replacing McCann Erickson Worldwide, which created national campaigns with spending estimated at $225 million. Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners, will work on creative projects, a new assignment. The media planning and buying parts of the account are being shifted from Universal McCann to MediaVest in New York, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of Publicis.  Since 2005, when Wendy's began to struggle with a sales slump, there had been speculation the company was seeking to change agencies. A sales rebound in the fourth quarter of 2006 damped that speculation.  ''Now that a turnaround has taken place in our business, we believe the timing is right to seek new resources to take our advertising efforts to the next level,'' said Ian B. Rowden, chief marketing officer at Wendy's in Dublin, Ohio. A campaign to replace the McCann Erickson work is expected in the spring.  Wendy's is the second big account gain for Saatchi & Saatchi in four months, after J. C. Penney. The Wendy's assignment to create campaigns aimed at Hispanic consumers will remain at the Vidal Partnership in New York.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA  ",

The report, published online last week in The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, was based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey, a six-year nationwide study of more than 33,000 people carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  According to background information in the article, the correlation between adults' and children's diets has usually been attributed to parental influence. But in the case of fat intake, it may be that children and teenagers, who consume more fat than other age groups, influence the diets of their parents.  The researchers gathered data based on 24-hour dietary recall from 6,600 adults, 48 percent of whom had at least one child under 17 in their household. After controlling for other variables, the presence of children was associated with an increased total fat consumption of 4.9 grams per day in adults, and an increased saturated fat consumption of 1.7 grams per day. Together, the total fat and saturated fat are the equivalent of a daily three-ounce serving of lean ham.  There was no association between the presence of children and the total number of calories consumed, but adults with children were more likely to eat pizza, cheese, cookies, ice cream, bacon and other high-fat foods.  ''I think the important thing we should take away from this study,'' said Dr. Helena H. Laroche, the lead author and an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Iowa, ''is that healthy nutrition should focus on the entire family, and not only on specific individuals within the family.''

                    "text": "  In the turf war that has come to characterize the computer chip market, Advanced Micro Devices, appears to have stumbled in the fourth quarter.  A.M.D., the second-largest maker of the microprocessors, issued a warning late Thursday that its fourth-quarter revenue would miss Wall Street's forecasts because of lower unit prices, signaling that the price war between A.M.D. and its main rival, Intel, had taken its toll.  On Friday, shares of A.M.D fell $1.92, to $18.26. Shares of Intel rose 21 cents, to $22.13.  A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to increase about 3 percent, or about $1.37 billion, over the third quarter. Fourth-quarter operating income, the company said, ''is expected to be positive but substantially lower than the third quarter.''  In October, analysts forecast A.M.D.'s fourth-quarter sales would be about $1.44 billion, excluding revenue gained from its $5.4 billion acquisition of ATI. A.M.D. executives said at the time that they expected a ''seasonally strong'' fourth quarter, which included the holiday shopping season.  The chip maker said its fourth quarter gross margin and operating income were hurt by lower average selling prices, though unit sales rose over all.  A.M.D. plans to issue its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 23 after the close of regular trading.  In the last few years, A.M.D. has managed to gain market share, as the market leader, Intel, has struggled to revamp its product line. The threat of competition led Intel to lay off more than 10,000 employees and cut costs sharply last year.  Yet in recent months Intel has staged something of a comeback, and in October, the company's chief financial officer, Andy D. Bryant, told analysts that he thought Intel had begun to win back market share.  After A.M.D.'s revised forecast, several Wall Street investment firms lowered their outlooks. Bear Stearns sharply cut its rating on the company, while Citigroup downgraded A.M.D. to hold, from buy.  Mark Lipacis, an analyst with Prudential, which also lowered its rating, wrote in a research note that he did not expect the price war to be resolved anytime soon. But, Mr. Lipacis said he believed that computer makers want a strong second supplier of chips and that he expected A.M.D. to continue to take unit share from Intel this year.  ''A.M.D.'s share is near the highest levels that it has ever been at,'' Mr. Lipacis said, ''and it seems that the company has gained enough critical mass in the market to weather downturns better than it historically has.''  The weakness appears to be solidly in A.M.D.'s server business, analysts said, the part of the market where A.M.D. has gained the most share from Intel.  An analyst at Bear Stearns, Gurinder Kalra, said he expected further pricing pressure as A.M.D. tries to prevent Intel from ''clawing back'' share.  ",

                    "text": "  Patriots Put a Stop to the Titans' Run  Corey Dillon ran for two touchdowns and Tom Brady threw for one as the Patriots defeated the Titans, 40-23, dashing Tennessee's hopes for a playoff spot. The host Titans (8-8) had won six games in a row and needed to beat the Patriots and hope the Jaguars, Bengals and Broncos lost. All three did, but the Titans proved no match for the Patriots (12-4), who will play the Jets in a wild-card game Sunday.  With New Orleans (10-6) set to play host to its first playoff game in the rebuilt Superdome in two weeks, Coach Sean Payton removed several key players early in the Saints' 31-21 loss to the visiting Panthers. Quarterback Drew Brees played only one full series and was 4 of 5 for 46 yards. Reggie Bush rushed for an early touchdown but played little more than a quarter, and running back Deuce McAllister had the day off. Carolina finished 8-8.  Shaun Alexander rushed for 92 yards and scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter as the Seahawks defeated the Buccaneers, 23-7. Visiting Seattle (9-7) had little to play for after clinching the National Football Conference West title; they will play host to Dallas in the first round Saturday. Tampa Bay finished 4-12.  Chargers and Ravens Finish 1-2 in A.F.C.  Philip Rivers threw two touchdown passes after spraining his right foot, and LaDainian Tomlinson also limped off after wrapping up his first rushing title as the Chargers defeated the visiting Cardinals, 27-20. The Chargers (14-2), who have won 10 in a row, clinched home-field advantage throughout the American Football Conference playoffs. Rivers and Tomlinson, who had one of his legs stepped on, said they would have played if the result had been more important, but the Chargers had already earned a first-round bye. Tomlinson ran for 66 yards, giving him 1,815 this season. Arizona finished 5-11.  Using a stellar performance from the defense and an efficient effort from the offense, the Ravens beat the Bills, 19-7, to earn the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C. Chris McAlister returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown and the host Ravens (13-3) allowed only 39 yards rushing. Buffalo finished 7-9.  Colts Finish Strong, but Cowboys Do Not  Peyton Manning threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score as the Colts held on to beat the visiting Dolphins, 27-22. Manning's two scoring passes gave him 275 in his career, moving him ahead of Joe Montana into seventh on the career list. Indianapolis (12-4), which blew a chance to earn a first-round bye by losing four times in the previous six weeks, will play host to Kansas City in a wild-card game Saturday. Cleo Lemon was solid in his first N.F.L. start for Miami (6-10), finishing 18 of 36 for 210 yards.  Done in by repeated mistakes from quarterback Tony Romo and a few more by cornerback Terence Newman, the Cowboys lost To the visiting Lions, 39-31, and blew their chance to stay alive in the N.F.C. East race. ''I can't tell you how disappointed I am, I really can't,'' Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells said. As much as Dallas (9-7) wanted to win the game, Detroit (3-13) might have been better off losing it. By winning, they gave the Raiders the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. But even the Lions could not refuse the gifts the Cowboys gave them, from a penalty on Newman that wiped out an interception return for a touchdown on the game's first snap to Romo's two fumbles and an interception.  In Other Games  Steven Jackson had a career-high 4 touchdowns and 142 yards rushing, helping the visiting Rams defeat the Vikings, 41-21. Jackson's 59-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter prevented Minnesota (6-10) from establishing a postmerger N.F.L. record for fewest yards rushing allowed in a season. They missed by 15 the mark of 970 yards set by the Ravens in 2000. The Rams finished 8-8.  Despite losing running back Ron Dayne (ankle) and tight end Jeb Putzier (broken foot) to injuries in pregame warm-ups, the Texans defeated the visiting Browns, 14-6. Houston (6-10) won back-to-back games for the first time since 2004 and tripled its victory total from last season. Cleveland finished 4-12.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  When overweight people lose weight, they often lose bone mineral density as well, increasing their risk for osteoporosis. But new research suggests that losing weight with exercise rather than calorie restriction can preserve bone strength.  Scientists randomly assigned 48 healthy, non-obese people in their 50s to three groups for a one-year study. The first group reduced calorie intake by 16 percent in the first three months and then 20 percent for the rest of the year. The second increased daily energy expenditure -- exercise, in other words -- by 16 percent in the first three months and then by 20 percent for the following nine months, carefully tracked by trainers using heart rate monitors. A control group was monitored without being assigned a diet or exercise program. The results appear in the Dec. 11 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.  The diet group lost an average of about 17 pounds; the exercise group about 14 pounds. But the people on the low-calorie diet also lost bone mineral density -- more than 2 percent at the spine, hips and leg. Those in the exercise group experienced no significant change in bone density, and the controls lost neither weight nor bone density.  The authors acknowledge that their sample was not large and did not examine sex differences in bone mineral density responses.  Dr. Dennis T. Villareal, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, recommends diet and exercise together in a weight-loss program. ''That way, you get the weight loss benefits of the diet,'' he said, ''but prevent the negative effect on bone health.''  VITAL SIGNS: ON THE SCALES  ",

                    "text": "  Even though Peyton Manning was not at his best Saturday, the Indianapolis Colts' defense was superb.  Following a script that few expected, the Colts opened the N.F.L. playoffs by defeating the Kansas City Chiefs, 23-8, at the RCA Dome. It was a role reversal for the Colts, known for their high-powered offense led by Manning, and for their porous defense, which ranked last in the league against the run during the regular season.  ''This was playoff football,'' said Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney, who had three tackles and two sacks. ''If not now, then when?''  The Colts changed their identity against the Chiefs. While Manning threw three interceptions in the game and struggled to find his rhythm in the first half, the Colts held Kansas City without a first down until late in the third quarter.  The first seven times that the Chiefs had the ball, they ran three plays and punted. It looked like a scene from the film ''Groundhog Day;'' the same thing happening over and over, as Kansas City's offense produced only seven first downs and 126 total yards.  ''We couldn't run, we couldn't pass, we couldn't do anything,'' Chiefs Coach Herman Edwards said.  When the Chiefs finally made their initial first down, late in the third quarter on a pass from Trent Green to Tony Gonzalez, Colts fans cheered derisively, mocking Kansas City for its struggles. The Chiefs finished that drive by scoring their only touchdown, but that was not enough to save their season, as the Colts advanced to meet the Baltimore Ravens in the next round of the American Football Conference playoffs.  Manning's numbers looked stout (30 for 38, 268 yards, 1 touchdown), but his two first-half interceptions could have changed the game's momentum if his defense had not bailed him out. Manning's first interception should have led to a Chiefs score, and his second probably cost the Colts at least 3 points.  In the third quarter, a pass by Manning was intercepted by Ty Law with no Colts receiver in the vicinity. Usually, it is Manning who confuses the defense, but for much of the game, Kansas City's defensive players kept showing up in places where Manning did not expect them to be.  ''Obviously, those were three poor throws,'' Manning said of his interceptions. ''I told Ty Law I would be glad to introduce him at the Hall of Fame.''  Unfortunately for the Chiefs, their defense eventually wore down. During the first half, Indianapolis had 15 first downs and held the ball for 21 minutes 5 seconds, compared with 8 minutes 55 seconds for Kansas City. Colts running back Joseph Addai took advantage of the tiring defense, rushing for 122 yards on 25 carries and eventually opening up the passing game for Manning.  Leading by 9-0 midway through the third quarter, the Colts scored the game's first touchdown, driving 89 yards in 12 plays to take a 16-0 lead.  How tired was Kansas City's defense? The Colts finished the drive with seven consecutive running plays, moving from Kansas City's 41. Addai capped the drive by running 6 yards up the middle for the touchdown.  Kansas City went to a hurry-up offense and responded with its only scoring drive, moving 60 yards in 8 plays, capped by a 6-yard scoring pass from Green to Gonzalez. Edwards decided to try a 2-point conversion, which paid off, Green passing to Kris Wilson to cut the Colts' lead to 16-8.  But instead of the momentum swinging to the Chiefs, Manning responded with his best drive of the game, moving the Colts 71 yards for their final touchdown, on a 5-yard pass to Reggie Wayne.  It was a satisfying victory for the Colts' defensive players, who had heard talk all week about how they would struggle to stop Chiefs running back Larry Johnson, who rushed for more yards this season than any player except LaDainian Tomlinson of the Chargers. But Johnson was held to 32 yards on 13 carries by the swarming and aggressive Indianapolis defense. By the fourth quarter, the Chiefs were forced to abandon Johnson and try to catch up through the air.  Nothing the Chiefs tried offensively worked for long, as the Colts overcame a lackluster offensive start.  The Colts squandered a chance to put Kansas City into a deep hole early, dominating the statistics but not the scoreboard. The Colts took a 3-0 lead on their opening drive. On their second drive, they looked poised to take a 10-0 lead, with second-and-goal from the 2. But the Chiefs held firm, and when Coach Tony Dungy sent the field-goal unit onto the field, many fans booed. Adam Vinatieri's 19-yarder, his second of three first-half field goals, made the score 6-0.  A brief momentum swing occurred when Law intercepted Manning early in the second quarter after wide receiver Marvin Harrison broke inside and Manning threw outside. Law, who caught the ball near midfield, almost returned it to the end zone after avoiding a tackle attempt by Manning. But he was caught from behind by Harrison at the 9, setting up the Chiefs with first-and-goal.  A touchdown and the extra point would have given Kansas City the lead, and perhaps have changed the direction of the game. Even a field goal would have helped. Instead, the Chiefs got nothing. After two carries by Johnson made it third-and-goal at the 2, Green fell after being accidentally stepped on by one of his lineman as he backed away from center. Kicker Lawrence Tynes compounded the error by missing a 19-yard field goal attempt, hooking the ball against the left upright. Tynes grabbed his head in disbelief, and the Colts ran off the field in celebration.  It was that kind of day for the Chiefs, and a day of redemption for the Colts' defense.  ''This was the way we had hoped to play all year,'' Dungy said. ''We picked a good time to play that way.''  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

According to Nielsen's estimates, the Day 6 debut earned 15.7 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m. Sunday, a slight decline over its year-ago season premiere (16.2 million). However, Monday's two-hour second installment also drew 15.7 million viewers, a modest improvement over the fifth season's second episode (14.9 million). CBS was No. 1 on Sunday, benefiting from an overrun of its N.F.L. playoffs coverage, followed by an interview with President Bush on ''60 Minutes'' at approximately 8:30 (17.2 million). ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' (16.7 million) also outdrew ''24'' during the 9 p.m. hour Sunday. On Monday, NBC's telecast of the 64th annual Golden Globes led during every half-hour of the night and averaged 20 million viewers over all, that award show's highest ratings in three years. NBC fared less well Sunday as the second week of ''Grease: You're the One That I Want'' at 8 (8.2 million) and ''The Apprentice'' at 9 (7.3 million) fell to fourth place.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''Trying to Find Solutions in Chaotic Middle Schools'' (''The Critical Years'' series, front page, Jan. 3):  It's a shame that the situation in the schools in your article rings so true.  The ages between 10 and 13 are an odd time because this is when children start to change, and some start to feel extremely uncomfortable with themselves. Segregating them into middle schools can reinforce that.  The nice thing about K-through-8 schools is that the children in the middle grades have an opportunity to mentor the younger children.  Separating out the fifth through eighth graders and then sending them on to high school means that they go through an adjustment of being the youngest three times instead of twice.  It can be beneficial for younger children to interact with the older ones if there are clear expectations on both sides.  I was fortunate when I was in high school to be allowed to tutor some younger students. What I learned from that has affected my work today in that I know that people don't learn at the same speed or in the same way.  I did not get that in middle school because we were segregated from the younger students and the older students as well.  In addition, it's nice to see where one has been (first grade) and where one is headed (eighth grade) while one is in sixth grade.  Older students can learn so much from interacting in a supervised situation with young students. It can give them a wonderful feeling of community that is not present in many places today.  A. L. Alterman  Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.  Jan. 3, 2007  To the Editor:  Your article articulates some of the challenges of early adolescence that the middle school movement, at its inception, sought to address.  Early adolescence is a stage of development when bodies and minds are changing more rapidly than at any other time in life, when emotions are unstable and relationships with peers become the driving force in life.  The article described a school system that is sadly missing the educational mark for early adolescents.  At this stage of life, children need safe schools in which they are actively engaged in challenging learning experiences that build their understandings of themselves and their world. An effective middle school curriculum must build on the interests of this age group to capture their attention.  These are the heart of the middle school, which no change in grade configuration can replace. The developmental needs of young people must be taken seriously if we are to create successful middle schools.  It is painful to read of consistent failure when there is so much that middle schools could be doing. Successful approaches are being used across the country. We need to be using more of these in New York.  Sue Ruskin-Mayher  New York, Jan. 3, 2007  The writer is director of middle school general teacher education at the Bank Street College of Education.  To the Editor:  You do an excellent job highlighting the difficulties encountered by middle schools. One thing you do not mention, however, is the frequently used policy of social promotion.  All too often, students learn that they will be passed on to the next grade regardless of whether or not they pass their classes.  As a result, many middle schools do not instill a sense of academic accountability in their students.  The end result is a large number of ill-prepared high school freshmen and increased numbers of dropouts as these students fail to earn credit toward graduation.  If school administrators are serious about reforming our middle schools, an alternative to social promotion, other than retention, needs to be developed.  Adam Berlin  Lawrence, N.Y., Jan. 3, 2007  The writer is a social studies teacher at Lawrence Middle School.  To the Editor:  Hmmm, they seem restless and undisciplined. Why not direct that excess energy toward learning or training at some point during the school day? What about dance, theater, singing, knitting or kickball? To the point that they're worn out.  And maybe even feel good about having learned something they can see and feel. And even appreciate classes where they just sit for a while.  Mary Garber  Richmond, Va., Jan. 3, 2007  ",

                    "text": "  More than four times as many households downloaded videos from file-sharing networks as they did from centralized services like iTunes in the third quarter of 2006.  Downloads from file-sharing networks are generally free, and have long occurred outside the control of copyright holders. The cost of for-pay downloads, about 90 percent of which go through iTunes, generally includes a licensing fee.  But not many of the freeloaders are actually downloading mainstream content, according to the new data on downloading, which was gathered by the NPD Group, a consumer-research firm, through tracking software installed in 12,500 households. Only about 20 percent of the videos downloaded from file-sharing networks were TV shows, and 5 percent were mainstream movies, while just under 60 percent were pornographic movies.  The relative scarcity of pirated movie downloads may have more to do with legal and business pressure than with users' tastes. Many file-sharing networks are struggling to find accommodation with the movie and recording industries; for example, BitTorrent, a service whose software is on about 80 million computers, struck a deal in 2005 with the Motion Picture Association of America to remove infringing content from the search index on its Web site.

                    "text": "  For the third time in less than three months, Wal-Mart Stores has made major decisions affecting the advertising agencies that handle its giant marketing assignments.  Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, chose two agencies yesterday -- the Martin Agency and MediaVest -- to handle important assignments for ads that the company aims at mainstream consumers and that appear in major media like television, magazines and the Internet. Wal-Mart spends an estimated $580 million a year on such ads.  The announcement came five weeks after Wal-Mart stunned Madison Avenue by overturning decisions made by senior marketing executives on Oct. 25 to hire the Draft FCB Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, as the lead agency to create ads, and Carat USA, part of the Aegis Group, to handle what is called media planning and buying -- that is, determining where ads run and how much to pay for them.  Wal-Mart attributed the reconsideration to what were described as improprieties in the selection process involving Draft FCB and two Wal-Mart marketing executives, Julie Roehm and Sean Womack, who were subsequently fired. Ms. Roehm and Mr. Womack have denied any wrongdoing.  Wal-Mart barred Draft FCB from taking part in the new selection during the holiday shopping season, but invited Carat USA to try again, which it did, only to fall short the second time.  Wal-Mart let another agency owned by Interpublic, the Martin Agency, participate in the second round as it had in the first. That paid off for Interpublic as Martin was chosen to replace Draft FCB as the creative agency.  Martin is best known for its popular gecko ads for Geico insurance and campaigns for United Parcel Service that celebrate the color brown.  ''We are very pleased with Wal-Mart's decision,'' Interpublic said in a statement.  Shares of Interpublic fell sharply on Dec. 7, when the creative assignment was taken from Draft FCB. They climbed 33 cents, or 2.5 percent, to close at $13.37 yesterday.  In the second review, Martin bested one other agency for the creative assignment, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group. Ogilvy had also taken part in the first review and accepted Wal-Mart's invitation to participate again.  Carat USA lost this time as MediaVest, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe, was chosen to handle the media assignments.  Carat USA and MediaVest vied in the second review against Mediaedge:cia, also owned by WPP. Other large advertisers that use MediaVest include Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble -- two of Wal-Mart's biggest suppliers.  Martin and MediaVest were chosen for their ''deep retail experience, recognized creativity and an understanding of our customers,'' John Fleming, chief marketing officer at Wal-Mart, said in a statement.  Wal-Mart originally began scrutinizing its advertising agencies in May after working for decades with two, Bernstein-Rein and GSD&M. The review was part of a comprehensive reassessment by Wal-Mart of how it speaks to consumers, spurred by a slowdown in sales growth and increased competition from rivals like Kohl's and Target.  Wal-Mart has been struggling to find the right balance in its ads between playing up low prices on items like pantry staples and basic clothing or promoting pricier products like flat-screen TV sets and designer clothing.  Bernstein-Rein, a Wal-Mart agency since 1974, was notified in August that it would not be rehired. GSD&M, part of the Omnicom Group, a Wal-Mart agency since 1987, was notified Oct. 25 that it had lost its assignments.  After Wal-Mart declared the do-over last month, it invited GSD&M to take part, but executives at the agency declined.  Also yesterday, Wal-Mart named three agencies to handle assignments aimed at multicultural consumers. Those assignments were being reviewed separately from the creative and media assignments for the general market.  Global Hue was named to create ads aimed at black shoppers. The IW Group was chosen for ads for Asian-American consumers. And L\u00f3pez Negrete Communications was selected for ads aimed at Spanish-speaking shoppers.  ",

                    "text": "  Two new ABC comedies failed to gain traction Wednesday, one week after making their debuts to modest ratings. Pushed back because of the live presidential address at 9 p.m., ''Knights of Prosperity'' drew 5.2 million viewers at about 9:30, according to Nielsen's estimates, while ''In Case of Emergency'' reached 5.8 million at 10. ABC did lead the 8 p.m. hour in total viewers with two episodes of ''According to Jim'' at 8 (8.3 million) and 8:30 (8.8 million). ABC finished third for the night. Among adults 18 to 49, CBS's premiere of ''Armed and Dangerous'' (8.2 million) won the 8 p.m. hour, while reruns of ''Criminal Minds'' from 9:30 to 10:30 (11.4 million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10:30 (10.1 million) put CBS on top for the night over all. NBC ranked second for the night, as an abbreviated ''Deal or No Deal'' (11.3 million) following President Bush's speech was the night's highest rated show among adults 18 to 49. (Nielsen estimated that 42.5 million viewers tuned in for the president's speech.) On the CW, Week 2 of ''Beauty and the Geek'' (3.9 million), the third edition of the series, led the 8 p.m. hour in the network's target demographic of adults 18 to 34.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

                    "text": "  In March, necessity moved Carmen Laureano and her two daughters from Florida to New York City.  Ms. Laureano, 36, lost her job when the day care center where she had worked for about three years came under new ownership. ''Everything changed for me; everything was down,'' she said.  She moved with her girls, Luz and Franchesca Rivera, 12 and 10, to the Bronx, hoping to stay with her mother. But the young family could not stay in her mother's housing complex for the elderly. She and the girls quickly found themselves homeless and entered the shelter system.  ''For the people living in the shelter it's not that easy to get out,'' Ms. Laureano said. But she did. With persistence, determination and some help from Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, Ms. Laureano has made a new city her family's new home.  In June, they moved into a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, and Ms. Laureano gave the bedroom to her daughters so they ''could have privacy.'' Framed family photos hang in the living room, where Ms. Laureano sleeps.  For a year, the $925 monthly rent is covered by Housing Stability Plus, a Department of Homeless Services program that offers a five-year subsidy that decreases gradually each year. Ms. Laureano is already worried about paying next year's rent.  ''I'm going to start studying because in one year I have to work,'' she said. Since moving here in the spring, Ms. Laureano has spent her time finding housing, schools and medical services for her family and caring for her daughters. She plans to take computer classes with the help of Catholic Charities. ''I have to start paying rent by myself.''  Her willingness to work is real, but so are her worries. Caring for Franchesca takes a special effort. ''Franchesca is a special girl,'' Ms. Laureano said. A lack of oxygen to her daughter's brain during birth caused mild mental retardation and behavioral problems. Ms. Laureano must be home when Franchesca returns from school. ''I have to be here, at 3; I have to be downstairs,'' she said.  Finding the right school to meet her daughter's needs was also a challenge. When they arrived in New York, Franchesca was mistakenly put in mainstream classes.  ''My daughter was in regular class and it was a mess,'' Ms. Laureano said. Franchesca was disruptive and could not do the work. ''It was hard for her, for the teacher, for the students.''  Ms. Laureano found help and a feeling of home, at the Thorpe Family Residence in the Bronx, where the family lived while it was homeless. The Thorpe residence is affiliated with Catholic Charities, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Thorpe staff connected Ms. Laureano to the services she needed. ''They give you support,'' she said. ''They help you out a lot. They are like a family.''  Counselors at Thorpe referred her to medical and educational services for Franchesca, and Ms. Laureano did considerable work following through. ''I have to start from the shelter, then I have to talk with the social worker to see if she could help me,'' she said, ''I went to two schools before I get that school.''  The school is Public School 161, where Franchesca started in the fall. She is in Spanish-language special education classes with her peers, working at a first-grade level. The family is from Puerto Rico, and Ms. Laureano taught herself English in Florida. Luz, in the sixth grade, speaks both Spanish and English, but is in some bilingual classes to provide better comprehension.  Franchesca, who speaks Spanish, was crying on the first day. But, by the second day, ''she was the friend of the teacher,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Being taught in Spanish and working with children at her level has made a big difference for Franchesca.  ''Mommy, Mommy, I know how to read!'' Ms. Laureano remembered her daughter announcing one day after school. The family celebrated, ''We made a party,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Ms. Laureano was also referred to a clinic for her daughter's mental health issues, and Franchesca received new medication to control her behavior. Now, Franchesca is calm and more focused, Ms. Laureano said. ''She could really learn. She could hear. Without the medication she just wants to fight.''  The family's monthly income is limited to $145 in public assistance and $255 in food stamps. With the help of staff members at Thorpe, Ms. Laureano is applying for Social Security supplemental income for Franchesca.  Two weeks after school began, the family received $425 in Neediest Cases money for school clothes, shoes, socks and underwear. The family also bought four folding chairs to put around a dining table. ''Thank you for all the help,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Franchesca is shy around strangers. She stayed in the bedroom and sometimes hid under the covers. She is not shy with her family. ''No way,'' Ms. Laureano laughed. ''It's different when we three are alone.''

                    "text": "  John D. Negroponte, nominated as deputy secretary of state, defended the Bush administration's more confrontational policy with Iran in a Senate confirmation hearing that was peppered with demands from both sides of the aisle that the United States show restraint in dealing with Tehran.  In a sign that the debate over Iraq is increasingly becoming a debate over Iran, Mr. Negroponte, appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, found himself answering the same questions, over and over again.  ''Do you think we are drifting toward a military confrontation with Iran?'' demanded Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.  ''I don't think that has to be, Senator,'' Mr. Negroponte replied. ''I think we would strongly prefer that the issues between us and Iran be resolved peacefully.''  Mr. Negroponte maintained that an emboldened Iran could harm American interests in the region.  ''We don't believe that their behavior, such as supporting Shia extremists in Iraq, should go unchallenged,'' said Mr. Negroponte, who is now the director of national intelligence.  In an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, President Bush said stern measures aimed at Iran should not be seen as a precursor to war. ''Some are trying to take my words and say, 'Well, what he's really trying to do is go invade Iran,' '' he said. ''Nobody's talking about that.''  The United States has refused to hold direct talks with Iran over the two major issues of contention: its nuclear programs and its stance toward Iraq. Instead, the Bush administration has increased pressure on Iran. The administration has seized Iranians in Iraq and is trying to starve Iran of international financing.  The Pentagon announced Tuesday that it had suspended the sale of spare parts for American-made F-14 fighter jets lest they end up in Iran, the only nation whose air force still flies the vintage plane. Many of the parts are common to other aircraft. The United States Navy retired its last squadrons in 2006.  Mr. Bush announced this month that the United States would send another aircraft carrier and its supporting ships to the Persian Gulf, a response to the growing concern that Iran is building up its own missile capacity and naval power to dominate the gulf militarily.  Meanwhile, the administration has continued to resist calls for it to initiate talks with Iran, and has said that it will do so only if Tehran suspends its enrichment of uranium.  ''The view at the moment is that we are reluctant to initiate a high-level diplomatic dialogue with Iran until there has been some progress on this nuclear issue,'' Mr. Negroponte said.  Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, warned him not to ''stumble into active hostilities with Iran without having aggressively pursued diplomatic approaches, without the American people understanding exactly what's taking place.''  ''This committee is going to be paying attention,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We do not want to see precipitous actions that have not been thought through, have not been discussed, have not been authorized.''  If confirmed, Mr. Negroponte would become the second-highest-ranking diplomat behind Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The deputy secretary of state job has been open since Robert B. Zoellick left to join Goldman Sachs in the summer.  Mr. Negroponte, who has spent 41 years in government service, speaks five languages fluently and has won Senate confirmation for eight posts, including five ambassadorships. He was ambassador to Iraq before President Bush chose him for the intelligence job in February 2005.  Several senators on the committee praised Mr. Negroponte as one of the most distinguished public servants of his generation, and there appeared to be no obstacle to his confirmation.  At a separate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, the admiral picked to lead American forces in the Middle East said Iran was increasing its military capabilities and seeking to curb American influence. ''They are posturing themselves with the capability to attempt to deny us the ability to operate in this vicinity,'' Adm. William J. Fallon told the Senate Armed Services Committee.  ",

                    "text": "  The Miami Heat defeated the Knicks handily Monday without Shaquille O'Neal and Dwyane Wade. On Friday, the teams will meet again, but this time it may be the Knicks who are short-handed.  Guard Stephon Marbury, who missed Wednesday's game against the Phoenix Suns with a knee injury, said Thursday that he was fit to play. But Coach Isiah Thomas said that center Eddy Curry, the Knicks' leading scorer, was questionable. Curry, who strained his left calf muscle during the second half Wednesday, did not practice Thursday.  One Knicks player whose status was not ambiguous was Jared Jeffries, an ineffective starter who played 9 minutes 14 seconds in the past two games. Jeffries, a forward, received a vote of confidence from Thomas, who did not discuss potential lineups other than to say that Jeffries would start against the Heat.  ''He's definitely got to play a little better than what he's playing,'' Thomas said. ''We'll stick with him, and hopefully he'll come out of it. And if not, we have some guys on the bench that are eager to play.''  The Knicks (18-26) will have their hands full even if Curry and Marbury are healthy and Jeffries produces. The Heat defeated them Monday in Miami, 101-83, without O'Neal and Wade, its two best players. If the Knicks lose, they will fall to a season-worst nine games below .500.  O'Neal and Wade returned Wednesday as the Heat (19-23) lost to the Indiana Pacers in overtime, 96-94. Wade was coming off a sprained ankle, and O'Neal had missed the previous 35 games while recovering from knee surgery. O'Neal, who came off the bench and played 14 minutes against the Pacers, will presumably play more against the Knicks.  Asked how effective he thought O'Neal would be Friday, Thomas pointed to the doorway leading to the trainer's room. ''When he stands in that door, he takes up the whole door,'' Thomas said. ''And when he stands in front of somebody, you can't see them. He's a big man, and that's the Shaq effect. It has nothing to do with points and rebounds.''  Defense might not be Curry's specialty, but he seems to be the natural matchup against O'Neal. If Curry is unable to play, it is not clear how Thomas will respond.  ''It would be a huge loss, but we'll get by,'' Thomas said.  Channing Frye would probably join Jeffries at forward. Thomas could go with a big frontcourt by inserting the seldom-used Jerome James or Kelvin Cato at center. Or he could use a smaller frontcourt and have the 6-foot-9 David Lee defend O'Neal. Lee would surrender four inches to O'Neal, but he is bulkier than Frye or Jeffries. The 6-7 Malik Rose, who sometimes guarded O'Neal when he played for the San Antonio Spurs, is another option.  The Knicks may simply rotate several players on O'Neal, spreading their fouls. They may try to wear him down on offense, too.  ''He's coming off an injury, so hopefully we can get out and push the ball in transition and make him run up and down the court,'' Jeffries said.  Jeffries missed 26 of the Knicks' first 30 games because of injury or suspension. He came to the Knicks in the off-season with a reputation as a defensive stopper. But his play this season has been as unsightly as his jump shot.  After practice Thursday, Jeffries said he needed to play with more confidence, an observation he has made before.  ''Whenever I play well, coaches play me,'' Jeffries said.  He added, referring to Thomas: ''So I haven't played well, and really right now he has no reason to play me. I put myself in this position.''  A return to form by Jeffries will be needed, especially if Curry is unavailable. Curry, who has started all 44 games and has been the focal point of the Knicks' offense, had his way inside against the Suns before feeling tightness in his calf during the third quarter. He was injured when he planted his left foot in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter. Curry, who left the game for good, was listed as questionable for Friday.  ''It's kind of hard to gauge it, being I didn't practice,'' said Curry, who initially feared the injury might cost him 15 to 20 games. ''It's kind of painful right now when I step. Try to loosen it up and see what happens.''  Marbury, who was listed as probable, seemed more certain of his status, though Thomas said he would be evaluated again Friday. If healthy, Marbury would probably join Quentin Richardson in the backcourt. Marbury has been playing with pain in his left knee since Dec. 15.  ''I worked out a little bit, did some running,'' Marbury said. ''I felt pretty good.'' He added: ''Yes, I'm playing tomorrow.''  BASKETBALL  ",

PATRIOTS' DEFENSE  In the teams' first meeting, the Jets' offensive line gave up four sacks in a 24-17 loss. In the November rematch, the Patriots were without the injured Ty Warren, their stellar left end. In his absence, the Jets were successful running the ball, gaining 117 yards on the ground (65 more than in the first game) en route to a 17-14 victory. Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork expects to return after missing three games with a sprained ankle. He will be a handful for Jets center Nick Mangold, who has been nursing a left thigh injury.

                    "text": "  Mirza Norales remembers waiting for her mother to pick her up from the emergency room as midnight approached one summer night in 2000, but she never came.  They had gone to St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx together after they had a fight where Ms. Norales, who was 14 at the time, suffered a blow to the head, she said. Her mother had warned her not to bring men into the house or she would throw her out, but Ms. Norales did, and her mother caught her.  That day was the beginning of the second phase of a turbulent, nomadic childhood for Ms. Norales, now 20, who bounced from home to home beginning when she was 4. The woman she waited for in the Bronx hospital was, in fact, one of several women she had called ''Mom.''  She was passed along from the homes of aunts and uncles in Honduras, her home country, for seven years after her parents died. Ms. Norales has never learned how her parents died. When she was 11, her relatives moved her to New York so that her maternal aunt and legal guardian could take care of her, as her biological mother had wished. But the situation was less than ideal and ended with Ms. Norales stranded in the emergency room that summer night in 2000.  ''I was rebellious, and sometimes I think it was my fault,'' she said.  She was taken from the emergency room to 7 Laight Street in Manhattan, an emergency intake center for children. She was then moved to Geller House School on Staten Island, where she stayed longer than the six months she was originally told she would stay, she said.  She behaved well because she wanted to go home, but after a year, her aunt refused to take her back, saying she did not have room in her one-bedroom apartment. Ms. Norales was then sent to Pleasantville Cottage School in Westchester County, a coeducational residential treatment center run by the Jewish Child Care Association, a part of the UJA-Federation, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  Her time there was turbulent.  ''I used to go AWOL because all you see in Pleasantville is trees,'' she said. She watched as her friends came and went to and from home visits, and she yearned to get out as well. So she would sneak a ride on a bus and ride along with her friends, or visit friends in the city. She soon got a job as a cashier at a McDonald's, where she worked for seven months.  After a year in Pleasantville, she was placed with foster parents, but it did not work out, and Ms. Norales was moved again. It was then that she met Michelle Jones, her third Mom. She lived in Brooklyn with Ms. Jones and her two children for two years, and finally felt that she was wanted and could have a good life.  Although she was treated by Ms. Jones as family, Ms. Norales still wanted to be with her actual family, so, when she turned 18, she moved in with another aunt in the Bronx.  Soon after she moved back to the Bronx she took a trip to Honduras, where she became pregnant and her adult life began, at 18.  Her son, Jaylen, was born prematurely on April 30, 2005, and her aunts were there to help. But after a lifetime of living somewhere between dependence and independence, Ms. Norales was ready to be on her own. She applied to public housing, got a job as a home assistant and moved into a one-bedroom apartment in the Webster/Morrisania Houses in the Bronx in March 2005, with the help of $626 from the Neediest Cases for a deposit and first month's rent.  She cooks hot Honduran meals for her son every day, keeps a clean house and tries to give him toys that she never had. Ms. Norales puts Jaylen in day care when she goes to work at Mimi Maternity in Manhasset, N.Y., and takes him to speech and physical therapy.  She plans to start community college full time next month and wants to earn a nursing assistant certificate. ''I need something better for my son than just to be in people's houses,'' she said.

                    "text": "  Matthew Marks Gallery  522 and 526 West 22nd Street; 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea  All through Jan. 27  There is a great candor to Ellsworth Kelly's art, and always has been, as you can see in what amounts to a small survey of early and recent work at Matthew Marks's various Chelsea galleries. The largest, on West 22nd Street, has a half-dozen of the artist's new abstract relief paintings, made of superimposed geometric panels. They're like altarpiece diptychs with subtly mismatched halves that stack rather than fold.  Each painting plays, in a straightforward way, with ideas that the artist, now 83, has been exploring for more than 60 years: the interrelationship, even interchangeability, of painting with sculpture; the creation of fictional objects in real space; the way abstraction can be its own kind of naturalism, intellectually demanding but utterly unesoteric, as plain and packed as a book.  Although Mr. Kelly's work is often associated with bright colors, these new pictures are in black and white. And that in itself has a long history in his career, as is demonstrated in a series of early works on paper in an adjoining gallery. Titled ''Drawings on a Bus -- Sketchbook 23, 1954,'' the series was done just after he had moved to New York, where he developed a form of abstraction inspired by the world around him.  The landmark painting ''Cit\u00e9'' (1951) is an example. It's like an image of light flickering on dark water, but translated into patterns of black-and-white bars. (The image is recaptured in a singe large print installed in Marks's window-only space on West 21st Street.)  ''Drawings on a Bus -- Sketchbook 23, 1954'' is what it says it is: a sequence of black ink sketches inspired by a changing shadow cast on a book the artist was reading on a bus ride. The main form starts as a small curve, then gradually swells; if you could look at the drawings flipbook-style, you'd see the black form expand to fill the white page. The sequence, drawn without guile or frills, is a record from nature and a fresh invention, from which the artist derived several black-and-white paintings.  There are more, unstacked double-panel pieces in the West 24th Street space. Here color returns, not quite bright, not quite subdued, complicated but not all that complicated -- monumental the way a tall open window, a mature rose bush or a Shaker dresser is monumental. They aren't.  HOLLAND COTTER  ART IN REVIEW  ",

                    "text": "  The 2006-7 season began as one long victory parade for the Maryland women's basketball team. After stunning the Duke Blue Devils in the N.C.A.A. championship game last April, the Terrapins have held the No. 1 spot in the national polls since November with an 18-game winning streak.  No team had challenged Maryland's perch until Saturday afternoon, when the Terrapins showed up at Cameron Indoor Stadium to meet Duke again.  And the rematch was no match. The Blue Devils outplayed Maryland in an 81-62 victory in front of a crowd of 9,314, a rare sellout for a women's game at Cameron.  ''I thought this game we were outworked, outhustled, outplayed, outcoached, you name it,'' Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said.  Duke guard Lindsey Harding drove the lane at will and finished with 28 points. The 6-foot-7 center Alison Bales had 18 points, 12 rebounds and 7 blocked shots.  Crystal Langhorne led Maryland (18-1) with 14 points.  It was the first meeting among the big three of the Atlantic Coast Conference. No. 1 Maryland, No. 2 North Carolina (19-0) and No. 3 Duke (18-0) have spent the season atop the polls and were the only three undefeated teams remaining going into Saturday's play.  The Terrapins, with all five starters back from last season's championship team, had been averaging 88.8 points a game, second best in the nation. But they faced a Duke defense that was allowing only 45.9 points a game, also second best in the nation. Duke held the Terrapins to 37.8 percent shooting from the field; they were 3 of 18 from 3-point range.  Maryland had taken an early lead before Duke built a 41-30 halftime advantage, led by Harding's 16 points. The Blue Devils, with three starters back from last season's team, knew better than to sit on that lead. Duke blew a 13-point lead to Maryland in the second half of the championship game before losing in overtime.  Duke Coach Gail Goestenkors said her halftime message was, ''I don't care about a lead, I have no interest in a lead right now, I don't want to secure a lead or hold onto a lead.''  Instead, the Blue Devils kept pushing and Maryland dropped behind by as many as 22 in the waning minutes. As the clock ticked down in the final minute, Duke guard Abby Waner allowed a smile to cross her face as she clapped her hands and motioned to the crowd. Goestenkors had ordered a distraught Waner to stay away from basketball for a month after the championship game loss.  ''One thing that Coach said to us yesterday that I think is really important is that with a win today, we don't win last year's national championship, that no matter what happened last year, we can't take it back,'' Waner said. ''So I'm more excited for this year. I think that this was our first big test, and we really proved ourselves, I feel like. But we have a lot farther to go.''  CONNECTICUT 76, SYRACUSE 45 -- The freshman center Tina Charles had 14 points, 19 rebounds and 5 blocks, and No. 7 Connecticut (14-1, 4-0 Big East) defeated visiting Syracuse (8-10, 2-3) in a tuneup before tomorrow's showdown with second-ranked North Carolina.  It was Charles's fifth double-double of the season, and her 19 rebounds were the most for a Connecticut player since Swin Cash had 20 against West Virginia in 2001. (AP)  STANFORD 63, WASHINGTON STATE 55 -- The freshman JJ Hones scored a season-high 17 points to help No. 10 Stanford (14-3, 7-0 Pac-10) send visiting Washington State (5-13, 1-7) to its seventh consecutive defeat. (AP)Texas A&M 60, Baylor 52 Takia Starks had 12 points and 11 rebounds, and No. 19 Texas A&M (12-3, 2-1 Big 12) defeated ninth-ranked Baylor (15-3, 2-2), the host Aggies' first victory against a top-10 team in five years. (AP)  MARQUETTE 76, VILLANOVA 70 -- Krystal Ellis scored 8 of her 21 points down the stretch to help No. 16 Marquette (16-2, 4-1 Big East) hold off visiting Villanova (7-10, 1-3) and bounce back from its loss at Pittsburgh on Tuesday that ended its 14-game winning streak.

                    "text": "  Bosch's search of the radiation victim's clothes has yielded no cesium. It turns out that he's Mexican, and Agent Walling tries to connect him to the Middle Eastern terrorists, who were believed to have entered the United States through the Mexican border. But Bosch isn't convinced.  Harry Bosch knew that the physics of traffic would not work for him in the Cahuenga Pass. The Hollywood Freeway always moved slowly in both directions through the bottleneck created by the cut in the mountain chain. He decided to stay on surface streets and take Highland Avenue past the Hollywood Bowl and up into the pass. He filled Rachel Walling in along the way.  ''The call for paramedics came from a print shop on Cahuenga near Lankershim. Gonzalves must have been in the area when he collapsed. The initial call said a man was down in the parking lot. I'm hoping that the Toyota he was driving is right there. I'm betting that if we find it, we find the cesium. The mystery is why he had it.''  ''And why he was foolish enough to put it unprotected in his pocket,'' Walling added.  ''You're basing that on him knowing what he had. Maybe he didn't. Maybe this isn't what we think it is.''  ''There's got to be a connection, Bosch, between Gonzalves and Nassar and Elfayed. He probably brought them across the border.''  ''We'll see.''  He almost smiled. He knew she had used his last name as a term of endearment. He remembered how she used to do that.  He took the ramp up to Cahuenga from Highland. It ran parallel to the freeway, and as soon as he checked, he saw that he had been right. The freeway was frozen in both directions.  ''You know, I still had your number in my cell's directory,'' he said. ''I guess I never wanted to delete it.''  ''I was wondering about that when you left me that mean message today about the cigarette ash.''  ''I don't suppose you kept mine, Rachel.''  She paused a long moment before answering.  ''I think you're still on my phone, too, Harry.''  This time he had to smile, even though he was back to being Harry with her. There's hope after all, he thought.  They were approaching Lankershim Boulevard. To the right it dropped down into a tunnel beneath the freeway. To the left it ended at a strip mall that included the Easy Print franchise from which the call to paramedics had originated. Bosch's eyes searched the vehicles in the small parking lot, looking for a Toyota.  He glided into the left-turn lane and waited to pull into the lot. He swiveled in his seat and checked the parking along both sides of Cahuenga. The quick glance showed no Toyotas, but he knew the brand had many different car models and pickup trucks. If they didn't find the car in the print-shop lot, they would have to work the curbside parking to look for it.  ''Do you have a plate or any description?'' Walling asked. ''How about a color?''  ''No, no and no.''  Bosch remembered then that she had the habit of asking multiple questions at once.  He made the turn on yellow and pulled into the lot. There were no parking spaces available, but he wasn't interested in parking. He cruised slowly, checking each car. There were no Toyotas.  ''Where's a Toyota when you need one?'' he said. ''It's got to be in this area somewhere.''  ''Maybe we should check the street,'' Walling suggested.  He nodded and nosed his car into the alley at the end of the parking lot. He was going to turn left to turn around and go back to the street. But when he checked to see if he was clear on the right, he saw an old white pickup truck with a camper shell parked half a block down the alley next to a green Dumpster. The truck was facing them, and he couldn't tell what make it was.  ''Is that a Toyota?'' he asked.  Walling turned and looked.  ''Bosch, you're a genius,'' she exclaimed.  Bosch turned and drove toward the truck, and as he got closer, he could see that it was indeed a Toyota. So could Walling. She pulled out her phone, but Bosch reached across and put his hand on it.  ''Let's just check it out first. I could be wrong about this.''  ''No, Bosch, you're on a roll.''  But she put the phone away. Bosch pulled slowly past the pickup, giving it a once-over. He then turned around at the end of the block and came back. He stopped his car 10 feet behind it. There was no plate on the back. A cardboard ''Lost Tag'' sign had been put in its place.  Bosch wished he had brought the keys he found in Digiberto Gonzalves's pocket. They got out and approached the truck, coming up on either side of it. When he got close, Bosch noticed that the rear-window hatch of the camper shell had been left open a couple of inches. He reached forward and pulled it up and open all the way. An air-pressure hinge held it open. Bosch leaned in close to look into the interior. It was dark because the truck was parked in shadow and the windows on the shell were darkly tinted.  ''Harry, you have that monitor?''  He pulled her radiation monitor off his belt and held it up in his hand as he leaned into the darkness of the truck's cargo hold. No alarm sounded. He leaned back out and put the monitor back on his belt. He then reached in to the latch and lowered the truck's rear gate.  The back of the truck was piled with junk. There were empty bottles and cans strewn everywhere, a leather desk chair with a broken leg, scrap pieces of aluminum, an old water cooler and other debris. And there by the raised wheel well on the right side was a gray lead container that looked like a small mop bucket on wheels.  ''Is that the pig?'' he asked.  ''I think it is,'' Walling said excitedly. ''I think it is!''  There was no warning sticker on it or radiation-alert symbol. They had been peeled off. Bosch leaned into the truck and grabbed one of the handles. He pulled it clear of the debris around it and rolled it to the tailgate. The top was latched in four places.  ''Do we open it and make sure the stuff is in there?'' he asked.  ''No,'' Walling said. ''We back off and call in the team. They have protection.''  She pulled her phone out again. While she called for the radiation team and backup units Bosch moved to the front of the truck. He looked through the window and into the cab. He saw more junk on the passenger side. His eyes held on a camera that was sitting on an old briefcase with a broken handle on the passenger seat. It didn't appear to be broken or dirty. It looked brand-new.  Bosch checked the door and found it unlocked. He realized that Gonzalves had forgotten about his truck and his possessions when the cesium started burning his body. He had gotten out and stumbled toward the parking lot seeking help, leaving everything behind and unlocked.  Bosch opened the driver's door and reached in with the radiation monitor. Nothing happened. No alert. He replaced it on his belt and walked back to his car. From the equipment kit in the trunk he got out a pair of latex gloves and put them on.  When he walked back past Walling, she was talking to someone about finding the pig. He moved back to the truck's cab. He leaned in and picked up the camera. It was a Nikon digital, and he remembered the lens cap found beneath the master bed at the Kent house by the SID team. He believed he was holding the camera that had taken the photograph of Alice Kent.  Bosch put the camera down and began looking through the things piled on the passenger seat. There was the broken briefcase, a child's lunch box, a manual for operating an Apple computer and a poker from a fireplace tool set. Nothing connected, and nothing interested him. He noticed a golf putter and a rolled-up poster on the floor.  He shifted his weight to one elbow on the armrest between the seats so that he could reach over and open the glove compartment. And there, sitting in the otherwise empty space, was a gun. Bosch lifted it out and turned it in his hand. It was a Smith & Wesson .22-caliber revolver.  ''I think we've got the murder weapon here,'' he called out.  There was no response from Walling. She was still at the back of the truck talking on her phone, now issuing orders in a hurried voice.  Bosch returned the weapon to the glove box and closed it, deciding to leave the weapon in its place for the forensics team. He noticed the poster again and decided for no reason other than curiosity to take a look at it. He unrolled it across all of the junk on the passenger seat. It was a chart depicting 12 yoga positions.  Bosch immediately thought about the discolored space he had seen on the wall in the workout room at the Kent house. He wasn't sure, but he thought the dimensions of the poster would match that space. He quickly rerolled the poster and started to back out of the cab so he could show Walling his discovery.  But as he was pulling out, he noticed that the armrest was also a storage compartment. He stopped and opened it.  He froze. There was a cup holder and in it were several steel capsules resembling bullet cartridges closed flat on both ends. The steel was so polished it almost looked like silver.  Bosch moved the radiation monitor over the capsules in a circular pattern. There was no alarm. He turned the device over in his hand and looked at it. He saw a small switch on its side. With his thumb he pushed it up. A blaring alarm suddenly went off, the frequency of tones so fast that it sounded like one long, ear-piercing siren.  Bosch jumped back out of the truck and slammed the door shut. The poster fell to the ground.  ''Harry!'' Walling yelled. ''What?''  She rushed toward him, closing her phone on her hip. Bosch pushed the switch again and turned the monitor off.  ''What is it?'' she yelled.  Bosch pointed toward the truck's door.  ''The gun's in the glove box and the cesium's in the center compartment.''  ''What?''  ''The cesium is in the compartment under the armrest. He took the capsules out of the pig. That's why they weren't in his pocket. They were in the center armrest.''  He touched his right hip, the place where Gonzalves was burned by radiation. The same spot would have been next to the armrest compartment if he was sitting in the truck.  Rachel didn't say anything for a long moment. She just stared at his face.  ''Are you O.K.?'' she finally asked.  Bosch almost laughed.  ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Ask me in about 10 years.''  She hesitated as if she knew something but couldn't share it.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing. You should be checked out, though.''  ''What are they going to be able to do? Look, I wasn't in the truck that long. It's not like Gonzalves, who was sitting in there with it.''  She didn't answer. Bosch handed her the monitor.  ''It was never on. I thought it was on when you gave it to me.''  She took it and looked at it in her hand.  ''I thought it was, too.''  Bosch looked back at the truck and wondered if he had just hurt or killed himself.  ''I need a drink of water,'' he said. ''I've got a bottle in the trunk.''  Bosch walked to the back of his car. Using the open trunk lid to shield Walling's view of him, he leaned his hands down onto the bumper for support and tried to decipher the messages his body was sending to his brain. He felt something happening but didn't know if it was something physically occurring to him or just the emotional response -- the shakes -- to what had just happened. He suddenly thought of his daughter, getting a vision of her at the airport the last time he saw her.  He cursed out loud.  ''Harry?''  Bosch looked around the trunk lid. Rachel was walking toward him.  ''The teams are headed this way. They'll be here in five minutes. How do you feel?''  ''I think I'm O.K.''  He reached into the trunk and got a liter bottle of water out of his kit. It was an emergency bottle he kept for surveillances that dragged on longer than expected. He opened it and took two strong pulls. The water wasn't cold, but it felt good going down. His throat was dry.  Bosch recapped the bottle and put it back in the kit. He stepped around the car to Walling. As he walked toward her he looked past her to the south. He realized that the alley they were in extended several blocks past the back of the Easy Print and ran behind all the storefronts and offices on Cahuenga. All the way down to Barham.  Every 20 yards or so there was a green Dumpster positioned perpendicular to the rear of the structures. Bosch realized that the Dumpsters had been pushed out of spaces between the buildings and fenced corrals. It was pickup day, and the Dumpsters were waiting for the city trucks to come.  Suddenly it all came to him. Like fusion. Like two elements coming together and creating a new element. It all came together for Bosch in that moment. The thing that bothered him about the photos, the yoga poster, everything. The gamma rays had shot right through him, but they had left him enlightened. He knew. He understood.  ''He's a scavenger.''  ''Who is?''  ''Digiberto Gonzalves,'' Bosch said, his eyes looking down the alley. ''It's collection day. The Dumpsters are all pushed out for the city trucks. Gonzalves is a scavenger, a Dumpster diver, and he knew they would be out and this would be a good time to come here. ...  ''And so did somebody else.''  ''You mean he found the cesium in a Dumpster?''  Bosch nodded and pointed down the alley.  ''All the way at the end, that's Barham. Barham takes you up to Lake Hollywood. Lake Hollywood takes you to the overlook. This case never leaves the page.''  Walling came over and stood in front of him, blocking his view. Bosch could hear sirens in the distance.  ''What are you saying? That Nassar and Elfayed took the cesium and stashed it in a Dumpster at the bottom of the hill? Then this scavenger comes along and finds it?''  ''I'm saying you've got the cesium back, so now we're looking at this as a homicide again. You come down from the overlook, and you can be in this alley in five minutes.''  ''So what? They stole the cesium and killed Kent just so they could come down here and stash it? Is that what you're saying? Or are you saying they just threw it all away? Why would they do that? I mean, does that make any sense at all?''  Bosch noted that she had asked six questions at once this time, possibly a new record.  ''Nassar and Elfayed were never near the cesium,'' he said. ''That's what I'm saying.''  He walked over to the truck and picked the poster up off the ground. He handed it to Rachel. The sirens were getting louder.  She unrolled the poster in her hands and looked at it.  ''What is this? What does it mean?''  Bosch took it back from her and started rolling it back up.  ''Gonzalves found that in the same Dumpster he found the gun and the camera and the lead pig.''  ''So? What does it mean, Harry?''  Two fed cars pulled into the alley a block away and started making their way toward them, weaving around the Dumpsters pushed out for pickup. As they got close, Bosch could see that the driver of the lead car was Jack Brenner.  ''Do you hear me, Harry? What does it --''  Bosch's knees suddenly seemed to give out and he fell into her, throwing his arms around her to stop himself from hitting the ground.  ''Bosch!''  She grabbed on and held him.  ''Uh ... I'm not feeling so good,'' he mumbled. ''I think I better. ... Can you take me to my car?''  She helped him straighten up and then started walking him toward his car. He put his arm over her shoulders. Car doors were slamming behind them as the agents got out.  ''Where are the keys?'' Walling asked.  He held the key ring up to her just as Brenner ran up to them.  ''What is it? What's wrong?''  ''He was exposed. The cesium is in the center console in the truck cab. Be careful. I'm going to take him to the hospital.''  Brenner stepped back, as if whatever Bosch had was contagious.  ''O.K.,'' he said. ''Call me when you can.''  Bosch and Walling kept moving toward the car.  ''Come on, Bosch,'' Walling said. ''Stay with me. Hang in there and we'll get you taken care of.''  Bosch almost smiled. She had called him by his last name.  Next week: Reeling from exposure, Bosch fingers the wrong man.

                    "text": "  THE wooden canoe, a curiara in the language of my Pem\u00f3n Indian guides, winds through the rapids of the Carrao River in southeast Venezuela. A drizzle lets up as the sun rises, revealing the misty escarpments of Auyan-tepui. Then, abruptly, the tepui -- a Pem\u00f3n word for the majestic sandstone mountains in this wide swath of jungle and savanna -- comes into magnificent relief. It is easily one of the most impressive sights I've ever encountered.  But the best part is yet to come: Angel Falls, the world's tallest waterfall at 3,212 feet (almost 20 times the height of Niagara Falls), named in honor of Jimmie Angel, the Missouri-born bush pilot who crash-landed his turboprop nearby in an ill-fated search for gold in the 1930's. Though the Pem\u00f3n Indians were surely among the first to contemplate the waterfall, the name Angel Falls stuck after word of the arduous 11-day trek of Angel's traveling party reached the outside world. By 1949, the American photojournalist Ruth Robertson had measured Angel Falls for an expedition described in National Geographic, cementing the mystique of Venezuela's tepui country.  Venezuela has done little to develop this corner of Bol\u00edvar State, and the flight from Puerto Ordaz, over thick jungle and sinewy rivers, to Canaima, an asphalt strip and collection of thatched huts that passes for an airport, attests to the region's remoteness.  ''I might have one of the most rewarding jobs in the world,'' said Laszlo Miszlai, 36, the Venezuelan pilot of the Cessna Grand Caravan that swooped in for a dramatic view of Angel Falls before we landed. ''I not only get to fly over the falls almost every day, but I get to see the awed expressions of our passengers.''  Beyond the polarizing political theater that defines Venezuela these days are places of intense beauty, from deserted Caribbean beaches to snow-capped peaks. Angel Falls, in the heart of Canaima National Park, a protected reserve about the size of Belgium, may top them all.  Geography unique to Venezuela made the surreal setting around Angel Falls possible. There are dozens of tepuis (pronounced tey-POO-ees) in this region, remnants of what geologists believe were the mountains of the ancient supercontinent known as Gondwana. Some of these isolated mesas are two billion years old, preserving an array of unique plant and animal life that rivals that of places like the Gal\u00e1pagos.  ''Think of each of these mountains like an island surrounded by forest,'' said Charles Brewer-Car\u00edas, a Caracas-based naturalist and explorer who is an eminent expert on Auyan-tepui and the country's other mesas.  ''Some birds cannot fly from one tepui to another because of the distances involved,'' added Mr. Brewer-Car\u00edas, who described a family of flowering plants found near Angel Falls that is related to plants in Madagascar, another long-isolated portion of Gondwana, which once included Africa, Antarctica, South America, Australia and the Indian subcontinent, among other land masses.  ''Each tepui has characteristics that give us a window into what the world was like more than a billion years ago,'' said Mr. Brewer-Car\u00edas.  When I arrived in Canaima in early October near the end of the rainy season, I found myself contemplating a more recent time -- the year 1956. That was when Rudolf Truffino Van Der Lugt, a Dutch adventurer and hotelier, arrived in Canaima to scout out locations for a lodge after working for a spell at the Hotel Tamanaco in Caracas.  He called his establishment -- a series of thatched-roof buildings and a bamboo bar -- Campamento Ucaima and became known as Jungle Rudy, the go-to guy for anyone planning an expedition to Angel Falls. In the '50s, ''almost nothing was known about the area,'' the Dutch writer Jan Brokken wrote in his 2004 biography, ''Jungle Rudy.'' Numerous lodges cater to travelers who come to Canaima for a glimpse of Angel Falls, but Campamento Ucaima has the grandest and most eccentric past. It still feels like an isolated outpost when the fog rolls in off Auyan-tepui. Though accessible only by canoe from Canaima, Ucaima has its small luxuries, among them a drink made with Venezuela's delicious Santa Teresa rum and papaya juice, which was handed to me as soon as I arrived.  I gazed around at the spartan world Rudy Truffino had created: hammocks slung on the porches of bungalows; canoes docked in a small river port; a staff chatting in a patois of Pem\u00f3n and Spanish. Some leather-bound notebooks contained decades-old clippings of Truffino's Mosquito Coast-esque trajectory into this jungle after leaving post-war Europe.  Truffino died in 1994, and his lodge is now run by his daughters, who appear as children in a black-and-white photo in Ucaima's bar with their Austrian mother and their father, who is petting a capybara, a large rodent. A guide named Yosmary L\u00f3pez proudly told me that the lodge had been host to Prince Charles, Neil Armstrong and the German filmmaker Werner Herzog.  I gulped down the welcome cocktail and Ms. L\u00f3pez shepherded me and a few other arrivals into a canoe for an excursion to Salto Sapo, or Frog Falls. The 20-minute ride upriver and the one-and-a-half-hour hike through thick rain forest and lighter savanna vegetation was a warm-up for the following day when we would ascend to the foot of Angel Falls.  Near Salto Sapo, Ms. L\u00f3pez, who was taking a sojourn from her university studies in western Venezuela, plucked a yellow flower from the ground that was a little larger than a pinhead. ''It's the smallest orchid in the world,'' she said. I had no way of confirming this information, but I marveled at the intricacy of the tiny orchid and the geologic isolation that had made its evolution possible.  WE were drenched as we navigated a narrow rock pathway under Salto Sapo's curtain of water, holding on to a withering length of rope; when we emerged on the other side of the waterfall we could see a group of Pem\u00f3nes playing soccer on a sandy spot.  By the time we hiked down to the impromptu soccer field they were gone, so we jumped into the water for a swim. Rain started falling and I was surprised by the orange, tannin-tinted color of the river water. In the distance, two other mesas, Kur\u00fan-tepui and Kusari-tepui, soared above the savanna and jungle.  The remoteness of this region has kept it relatively pristine; it is still impossible to travel by car through most of Canaima National Park because there are almost no roads. Airstrips built by Capuchin missionaries allow limited travel in small planes. Canoeing or hiking are the most common ways of getting around.  I got a taste of both methods the next morning with Leomar Jaramillo, a Pem\u00f3n guide who grew up in the village of Santa Marta near Angel Falls. With Auyan-tepui still sheathed in darkness, we set out in a motorized curiara for the four-hour trip to the base of the waterfall.  Mr. Jaramillo, 22, maneuvered the canoe upriver against the rapids with amazing deftness before arriving at a camping site and lookout point where we could view Angel Falls in the distance. I had never been a huge fan of waterfalls before, but even from this distance, the falls, which shoot water over the top of Auyan-tepui in a ''V'' formation, were breathtaking.  We had a brief breakfast of arepas, the white corn cakes that are a staple throughout Venezuela, then set out on a smooth sandy path that led into thick jungle. Early on, we came upon a small coral snake, at which Mr. Jaramillo shrugged and said was deadly. Then we proceeded up the tepui, stopping occasionally to peek at the falls through the trees or gulp down some water.  The path in some stretches was completely overgrown with trees, reminding me how oppressively dark the jungle can be, and I wondered what it was like for Jimmie Angel when he descended Auyan-tepui without any way of reaching the outside world  Slowly, I ascended the tepui, grasping parts of tree trunks and branches to gain balance on the slippery mud and stones. Ahead, Mr. Jaramillo blissfully jogged up the path as if he were strolling on the savanna. Little by little, the thick trees above us began letting in more sunlight, raising the temperature to greenhouse levels. We glimpsed Auyan-tepui's stone escarpment and, finally, the water falling more than 3,000 feet from the top of the soaring mesa.  But we still had about an hour to go before we arrived at Angel Falls. When we finally got there, the pool of cool water at the base of the falls was a welcome sight. I dove in, doing a backstroke as I gazed up at a cascade of water that doesn't so much crash as separate into smaller falls and showers of mist as it descends in seemingly slow-motion. There were no souvenir stands or snack bars here, just a few boulders to sit on. All around us was dense green jungle, accentuating the isolation and benign neglect that has thus far prevented this place from turning into an easily accessible tourist destination.  A retired oil executive who made the trek to the base of Angel Falls with his wife and his teenage daughter were the only other Americans I encountered. A sprinkling of other nationalities was there, some Italians, Spaniards and a Serb. Some Venezuelans were there, too, lugging a bottle of Scotch whiskey and a bucket of ice.  Eventually, we hiked down the tepui back to the lookout point, where our guides prepared a lunch of chicken roasted on a spit over an open fire, accompanied by casabe, a hard bread made from manioc.  Later, in the canoe back to Ucaima, I stole a last glance at Angel Falls. I had gotten a taste of Venezuela's legendary lost world and now I wanted more.  VISITING A PREHISTORIC WORLD  GETTING THERE  Venezuelan airlines fly round-trip from Caracas to Puerto Ordaz daily, with the one-hour flight costing about $170 (prices for flights, lodging and other services below are in United States dollars). Charter companies and Servicios A\u00e9reos Mineros, or Serami, a small private carrier, make the one-hour trip from Puerto Ordaz to Canaima each day for about $240 round trip, according to Akanan Tours, a Caracas-based company that arranges flights, lodging and hiking excursions in Canaima National Park (58-212-264-2769, www.akanan.com). The trip on Serami's propeller plane includes a fly-over of Angel Falls close enough to remind you of Jimmie Angel's bravado in landing his Flamingo airplane atop Auyan-tepui in 1937.  The rainy season, from May to December, offers some of the better conditions for canoe trips with guides who take travelers by river relatively close to the foot of Angel Falls. Hotels and airlines commonly quote their prices in United States dollars to foreign visitors.  WHERE TO STAY  Most of the lodges and small hotels known as ''camps'' offer packages that include all meals and lodging. Alcoholic drinks are often charged separately.  The most intriguing place to stay around Angel Falls is Campamento Ucaima, founded by the Dutch hotelier and adventurer Rudy Truffino in the 1950s. Also known as Jungle Rudy's, its 14 rooms and thatched-hut bar feel like a placid outpost of civilization along the Carrao River. Meals are served in an open-air dining room where visitors can gaze at the sun rising above the thick jungle. Rates are about $220 per person for a spartan room with a shower, bed and a hammock on the porch. (58-286-962-2359; www.junglerudy.com).  Campamento Canaima is a modern hotel near the edge of a lagoon with the luxury of a strip of white sand beach. With 109 rooms largely in the form of yellow bungalows, Canaima has a multilingual staff and rates of about $187 a night (58-212-976-0530).  EXPLORER | ANGEL FALLS  Correction:  January 28, 2007, Sunday  The Explorer column on Jan. 14 about Angel Falls in Venezuela, misidentified the type of airplane flown by Jimmie Angel, who survived a crash landing there in the 1930s. It was a radial-engine monoplane -- not a turboprop, which was not developed until the 1940s.  ",

                    "text": "  Intel reported yesterday that fourth-quarter profit fell 39 percent as the company continued to fight for market share and to absorb the high cost of its corporate overhaul.  The company, the world's largest chip maker and a closely watched indicator of the overall strength of the technology industry, reported slightly higher sales than Wall Street predicted, although they were still down 5 percent from the period last year.  But on the critical measurement of gross profit margin, Intel clearly disappointed, indicating the price war with its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices continued to take a toll.  Intel projected that its gross profit margin would be about 49 percent during the first quarter of 2007, down from 49.6 percent during the fourth quarter of 2006. Intel estimated that gross profit margin would be only about 50 percent for all of 2007. That compares with a gross profit margin of 61.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.  ''These results were clearly mixed,'' said Adam Parker, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''People wanted to see that gross margins had reached the bottom in the fourth quarter, but they didn't.''  The report was released after the market's close yesterday, but investors reacted strongly to the forecast of a lower profit margin, sending shares of Intel down 88 cents, or nearly 4 percent, in after-hours trading. Earlier in the day, Intel shares rose 17 cents, to close at $22.30 in regular trading.  Intel's net income for the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion, or 26 cents a share, including the cost associated with stock option expenses. In last year's fourth quarter, the last quarter in which it expensed stock options, Intel posted net income of $2.45 billion, or 40 cents a share.  The company's revenue declined 5 percent, to $9.69 billion, from $10.2 billion last year, at the top of the range of $9.1 billion to $9.7 billion the company had forecast.  Analysts were expecting earnings of 25 cents a share on $9.44 billion in revenue, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial.  For 2006, Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., posted revenue of $35.4 billion, while its net income was $5 billion, or 86 cents a share.  Closing what he called ''a very tough pricing year,'' Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, indicated that Intel would continue to price aggressively this year. ''We're going to have to fight to win orders,'' Mr. Bryant said in a conference call with analysts.  The brightest spot for Intel was that it sold record numbers of its highest-priced microprocessors, those used in computer servers. Sales of those chips helped drive up Intel's average selling price during a period in which Intel was continuing to cut prices on older products.  Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, described 2006 as a unique year in which the company introduced 40 new products. ''We've never had that broad a base of new products all at once,'' Mr. Otellini said in the conference call.  Intel's report of higher selling prices on server chips was in stark contrast to news from A.M.D. last week. That company, which is scheduled to issue its earnings report on Jan. 23, warned last week that its fourth-quarter revenue would miss Wall Street forecasts because of lower unit prices.  A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to be about $1.37 billion, or only about 3 percent above the third-quarter level. The news sent shares of A.M.D down $1.92, to $18.26, on Friday. Yesterday, A.M.D. shares declined 23 cents, or about 1 percent, in after-hours trading, after declining 13 cents, to close at $18.13, during the regular session.  Intel said it was also facing the high cost of its transition to a major new manufacturing process, a transition that occurs roughly every two years. Mr. Bryant said the bulk of the costs of the manufacturing changes would occur in the first half of 2007.  Looking ahead, Intel said first-quarter revenue would be $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion, in line with analysts' forecast of $8.93 billion. Mr. Bryant declined to provide a full-year forecast.  In September, the company announced a major revamping, including the elimination of 10,500 positions. Intel ended the fourth quarter with 94,100 employees, down more than 6,000 from the second quarter. Costs associated with layoffs decreased earnings by about 1.5 cents a share in the fourth quarter, the company said.  ",

                    "text": "  In the turf war that has come to characterize the computer chip market, Advanced Micro Devices, appears to have stumbled in the fourth quarter.  A.M.D., the second-largest maker of the microprocessors, issued a warning late Thursday that its fourth-quarter revenue would miss Wall Street's forecasts because of lower unit prices, signaling that the price war between A.M.D. and its main rival, Intel, had taken its toll.  On Friday, shares of A.M.D fell $1.92, to $18.26. Shares of Intel rose 21 cents, to $22.13.  A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to increase about 3 percent, or about $1.37 billion, over the third quarter. Fourth-quarter operating income, the company said, ''is expected to be positive but substantially lower than the third quarter.''  In October, analysts forecast A.M.D.'s fourth-quarter sales would be about $1.44 billion, excluding revenue gained from its $5.4 billion acquisition of ATI. A.M.D. executives said at the time that they expected a ''seasonally strong'' fourth quarter, which included the holiday shopping season.  The chip maker said its fourth quarter gross margin and operating income were hurt by lower average selling prices, though unit sales rose over all.  A.M.D. plans to issue its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 23 after the close of regular trading.  In the last few years, A.M.D. has managed to gain market share, as the market leader, Intel, has struggled to revamp its product line. The threat of competition led Intel to lay off more than 10,000 employees and cut costs sharply last year.  Yet in recent months Intel has staged something of a comeback, and in October, the company's chief financial officer, Andy D. Bryant, told analysts that he thought Intel had begun to win back market share.  After A.M.D.'s revised forecast, several Wall Street investment firms lowered their outlooks. Bear Stearns sharply cut its rating on the company, while Citigroup downgraded A.M.D. to hold, from buy.  Mark Lipacis, an analyst with Prudential, which also lowered its rating, wrote in a research note that he did not expect the price war to be resolved anytime soon. But, Mr. Lipacis said he believed that computer makers want a strong second supplier of chips and that he expected A.M.D. to continue to take unit share from Intel this year.  ''A.M.D.'s share is near the highest levels that it has ever been at,'' Mr. Lipacis said, ''and it seems that the company has gained enough critical mass in the market to weather downturns better than it historically has.''  The weakness appears to be solidly in A.M.D.'s server business, analysts said, the part of the market where A.M.D. has gained the most share from Intel.  An analyst at Bear Stearns, Gurinder Kalra, said he expected further pricing pressure as A.M.D. tries to prevent Intel from ''clawing back'' share.  ",

They are made with organic eggs and canola oil, with extra virgin olive oil in some of them as well. The blushed tomato flavor is excellent for sandwiches and cold seafood. Curried coronation sauce, with bits of raisins and apricots, will do wonders for hard-cooked eggs and chicken salad. Serve the mustard and honey flavor with meats like cold roast pork. There is also an herb variety as well as a plain one.  Chelsea Market Baskets in the Chelsea Market sells them for $6.95 for about 12 ounces, and they can be ordered at chelseamarketbaskets.com.

                    "text": "  The Indianapolis Colts, the team of Peyton Manning and the franchise that once had the legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas, probably never thought they would rely on a formula like this to win in the playoffs: Let the defense stop the opponent, have the place-kicker score all the points, and hope the offense does not make too many mistakes.  Who did they think they were -- the Baltimore Ravens? The Ravens, the team that brought football back to Baltimore, patented that game plan when they won the Super Bowl in 2001. But the Colts borrowed a page from that playbook Saturday, beating the Ravens, 15-6, to advance to next Sunday's American Football Conference championship game.  The Colts, for years the N.F.L.'s most dazzling offense, won in the most unexpected fashion -- without scoring a touchdown and by allowing fewer than 10 points for the second time in the playoffs. They have made their way through the playoffs without the white-hot spotlight and the staggering weight of outside expectations bearing down on them. Manning, whose postseason struggles have threatened to blemish his career r\u00e9sum\u00e9, has thrown five interceptions and only one touchdown pass in the past two games.  But if the New England Patriots defeat the San Diego Chargers in Sunday's A.F.C. playoff game, the Colts will play host to the championship game -- a perk they were supposed to enjoy last year, when they were the overwhelming favorite to reach the Super Bowl.  In the waning moments of the victory, after Adam Vinatieri had nailed his fifth field goal, Colts Coach Tony Dungy stood beside defensive tackle Anthony McFarland. Dungy and McFarland had been together in Tampa Bay, too, when the Buccaneers' repeated playoff runs were foiled by a terrible offense. The Bucs fired Dungy for his failure to win a title and he was quickly hired by the Colts, who hoped he would build a defense that would be a complement to Manning's offense.  With two smothering defensive efforts in the playoffs so far, Dungy seems to be fulfilling his mandate at precisely the moment when Manning has stumbled. So, on the sideline, Dungy and McFarland christened the Colts' victory: Call it Buc-ball.  ''We won a lot of games like this,'' Dungy said of his Buccaneers. ''We were having a laugh. These guys are all nervous. Every game we won, we won like this. It's Ravens ball. We outplayed them at their game.''  Actually, the Ravens have never had a quarterback like Manning. But the arrival of quarterback Steve McNair, who once shared league most valuable player honors with Manning, energized the offense and created a balance with the defense that propelled the Ravens to the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C.  But on Saturday both offenses were virtually beside the point. This was just the fourth time in N.F.L. history, and the first since 1979, that neither team scored a touchdown in a playoff game. The Ravens had the best defense in the league this season, but Manning said he could not recall, in his nine seasons in the N.F.L., ever winning a game without scoring at least one touchdown.  Except for the outcome, this was a forgettable performance for him. Scrambling to avoid pressure, Manning frequently overthrew his receivers. He was intercepted twice while completing only 15 of 30 pass attempts, statistically an even worse day than McNair had, with his two interceptions and 18-of-29 passing. Manning's 39.6 quarterback rating was nearly as bad as the 35.5 rating he posted when the Patriots battered the Colts in the 2005 A.F.C. championship game.  ''The plan coming in was to score touchdowns,'' Manning said, laughing. ''We were not planning to score 35 points, but we thought maybe 20 points. I knew it would be tough sledding.''  But Manning completed the most important pass of the game, in the middle of a clock-chewing fourth-quarter drive that kept the ball out of the Ravens' hands when they were trailing by only 6 points. On third-and-5 from Baltimore's 45, Manning zipped a pass to tight end Dallas Clark, who was blanketed by Ravens cornerback Corey Ivy.  At the most critical moment, the Ravens' defense could not make a stop. The Colts' defense, particularly against the run, was shredded for most of the regular season, but with the return of safety Bob Sanders from an injury that forced him to miss almost all of the regular season, the Colts have had consecutive lockdown performances. They held the Chiefs' Larry Johnson to 32 yards rushing last week, then held the Ravens to 83. They thwarted Baltimore's preferred style to get an early lead and then unleashed blitzes.  The Ravens never had the lead because the Colts had the one weapon they lacked last season: a reliable field-goal kicker. The Colts signed Vinatieri away from the Patriots expressly for games like this.  Last season ended for the Colts when Mike Vanderjagt badly missed a field goal in the divisional round. The league's most dynamic offense, and the improving defense, could do nothing to replace those 3 points, so the Colts replaced Vanderjagt as soon as free agency started with Vinatieri, one of the most clutch kickers in N.F.L. history.  Vinatieri has had plenty of highlight-reel moments, none more memorable than his successful field goals in a blizzard against the Oakland Raiders that propelled the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title. But if the Colts go to the Super Bowl, Vinatieri might have provided an omen to their postseason.  His third field goal of the game, late in the second quarter, was a 51-yarder. He did not hit it well and the ball seemed to die as it got near the goal post. It barely hit the cross bar and with its last bit of momentum, it bounced over.  It was not pretty, but it got through. Just like the Colts.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

The dish may be served alongside roasted or grilled meats. It is such a delectable tour de force, however, that at Michel Bras's restaurant in Laguiole, France, it is served as a separate course.  To make it yourself, finding the proper cheese and working the mixture to the desirable consistency are challenges.  Now, Marie de Livinhac, a company in the Auvergne region, is making a dehydrated aligot mix that requires only cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, water and five minutes' time. Rubbing the pot with a garlic clove is optional.  The secret is in sufficiently beating the mixture with a wooden spoon into satiny ribbons as it cooks.  A package to make enough for two is $7.99, one for four to five servings is $11.99, both at Fairway.  FOOD STUFF  ",

                    "text": "  When overweight people lose weight, they often lose bone mineral density as well, increasing their risk for osteoporosis. But new research suggests that losing weight with exercise rather than calorie restriction can preserve bone strength.  Scientists randomly assigned 48 healthy, non-obese people in their 50s to three groups for a one-year study. The first group reduced calorie intake by 16 percent in the first three months and then 20 percent for the rest of the year. The second increased daily energy expenditure -- exercise, in other words -- by 16 percent in the first three months and then by 20 percent for the following nine months, carefully tracked by trainers using heart rate monitors. A control group was monitored without being assigned a diet or exercise program. The results appear in the Dec. 11 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.  The diet group lost an average of about 17 pounds; the exercise group about 14 pounds. But the people on the low-calorie diet also lost bone mineral density -- more than 2 percent at the spine, hips and leg. Those in the exercise group experienced no significant change in bone density, and the controls lost neither weight nor bone density.  The authors acknowledge that their sample was not large and did not examine sex differences in bone mineral density responses.  Dr. Dennis T. Villareal, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, recommends diet and exercise together in a weight-loss program. ''That way, you get the weight loss benefits of the diet,'' he said, ''but prevent the negative effect on bone health.''  VITAL SIGNS: ON THE SCALES  ",

                    "text": "  The newly appointed archbishop of Warsaw, Stanislaw Wielgus, abruptly resigned on Sunday at a Mass meant to celebrate his new position after having admitted two days earlier that he had worked with the Polish Communist-era secret police.  There is no direct evidence that Bishop Wielgus spied on any of his fellow clergy members. But the revelation and the resignation have shaken one of Europe's largest concentrations of Catholics and refocused scrutiny on collaboration with the Communist government by some of the clergy in Poland even as the church was supporting dissidents trying to free themselves from that political system.  Moments before he was to symbolically ascend to his new place in the church hierarchy by taking his seat on the archbishop's throne at St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw, Bishop Wielgus read from a letter he had sent Pope Benedict XVI earlier in the day offering his resignation ''after reflecting deeply and assessing my personal situation.''  A roar of shock arose from the crowd inside the cathedral and stunned many people watching the proceedings live on television. The Vatican had announced the resignation a half hour earlier, though few had heard the news.  ''Stay with us, we want you here!'' people in the church shouted as a clearly troubled Bishop Wielgus removed his glasses and sat down beside Warsaw's departing archbishop, Cardinal Jozef Glemp.  The Vatican reappointed Cardinal Glemp to the position until a new archbishop could be found, and he took the throne instead. But Cardinal Glemp, who supported Bishop Wielgus's promotion, was also clearly troubled by the sudden turn of events and defended him later in his homily.  The Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, who was sitting at the front of the congregation, applauded Bishop Wielgus's resignation then stopped, apparently realizing that the commotion from the crowd was overwhelmingly against it. Mr. Kaczynski has led the country's renewed efforts to expose former Communist secret police agents and their informants.  Outside the cathedral, scuffles erupted between supporters and detractors of the bishop among the hundreds of Catholics gathered beneath umbrellas in the rain. Some of his supporters shouted that ''Jews'' were trying to destroy the church. Anti-Semitism, long present in Poland, is a particular problem within some conservative branches of the Polish Catholic church.  The resignation of an archbishop, or even a bishop, so soon after an appointment is rare, if not unprecedented, and raises questions about how he could have been given the job with such serious doubts surrounding his past.  Bishop Wielgus, 67, had tried to minimize reports of his collaboration, which surfaced two weeks after the pope appointed him to the post on Dec. 6. He insisted that his contacts with the country's feared Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, were benign and routine.  Bishop Wielgus may have believed that there were no longer documents linking him to the secret police. Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, who served as chief of secret services and minister of internal affairs during the Communist years, told the Polish clergy in the early 1990s that all files related to them had been destroyed, according to Adrzej Jonas, editor of the Warsaw Voice, a weekly newsmagazine. But microfilm of some of the documents on Bishop Wielgus survived. They do not include any reports written by the bishop, though in one document a secret police agent praised him for providing information on fellow priests while teaching at the Catholic University of Lublin. He admitted deeper involvement Friday after the Polish news media published the documents, though he maintained that he did not spy on anyone or hurt anyone. Two groups of experts, one from the church, said the documents proved his willingness to work for the secret police even though they did not prove what he did.  That judgment set in motion negotiations with the Vatican that ended with his resignation. In its statement, the Vatican said the charges surrounding Bishop Wielgus had ''gravely compromised his authority.''  Allegations that the secret service archives contained incriminating documents concerning Bishop Wielgus first appeared in the Polish media in the middle of 2006, shortly after he was mentioned as a potential successor to Cardinal Glemp. The documents that led to his resignation had been located by Dec. 20, when the Polish news media began reporting their contents.  Still, the Vatican was sufficiently confident of Bishop Wielgus's innocence to allow him to take the canonical vows for the post Friday. It even reissued a statement saying that it had taken into account ''all the circumstances of his life, including those regarding his past,'' and that Pope Benedict had ''every confidence'' in him.  Many people believe that the pope changed his mind only after personally reviewing the documents in question or at the urging of Polish government officials.  ''Definitely there must have been somebody very high up, maybe the president, who was in touch with the Vatican,'' said Zbigniew Lewicki, a professor at the University of Warsaw. ''Otherwise, why would he have changed his mind without anything new surfacing.''  It is the second major miscalculation by Pope Benedict since he was chosen as pontiff in April 2005. In September, he caused an uproar among Muslims with a speech he gave in Germany that seemed to equate Islam with violence.  Any cooperation between the Polish clergy and the secret police is troubling to Poles because the church under the Polish-born pope, John Paul II, was considered a beacon of hope and encouragement to people opposing the Communists.  That the head of the Warsaw archdiocese could be a former Communist collaborator would have been a cruel twist for many people here who remember the murder of Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, one of the first priests from the influential archdiocese to support the pro-democracy Solidarity movement. He was beaten to death by police agents in 1984. They dumped his body in a reservoir.  Poland screened thousands of people for past Communist collaboration in the early 1990s, but the process lost momentum until President Kaczynski revived it last year. He has argued that the country's 1989 transition left much of the Communist apparatus in place, fueling corruption and distorting democracy. He says society cannot move forward without breaking with that past.  But many people argue that the secret police files are in many cases too incomplete or unreliable for conclusive judgments and are too easily manipulated for political ends.  It was not clear what Bishop Wielgus would do in the wake of the resignation. The bishop said his contact with the secret police started when he applied to study in what was then West Germany.  He spent 1973-75 at the University of Munich and went there again in 1978 when Pope Benedict, then Joseph Ratzinger, was teaching there. He spent the rest of his career teaching philosophy at the Catholic University of Lublin, where he served three terms as rector. Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of Plock, north of Warsaw, in 1999 and he served in that post until being appointed archbishop of Warsaw.  The drama over Bishop Wielgus was, in part, a battle between opposing forces in the Polish church -- mirrored in societies across the post-Soviet bloc -- between those willing to forgive and forget and those who insist that past Communist collaborators be exposed and be excluded from positions of authority.  ''Today a judgment was passed on Bishop Wielgus,'' said Cardinal Glemp in a homily defending the prelate that was interrupted repeatedly by applause. ''But what kind of judgment was it, based on shreds of paper photocopied three times over? We do not want such judgments.''  Had the church managed to keep Bishop Wielgus in his new job, the program to purge former collaborators would have been severely weakened, Mr. Jonas of the Warsaw Voice said.  ''It wouldn't be possible to accuse somebody or blame somebody for being a spy or former member of the secret service if the archbishop of Warsaw was himself one,'' he said.  ",

                    "text": "  By the time Robbie Gould lined up for Sunday's game-winning field goal in overtime, some of his teammates were more nervous than he was.  ''I didn't want to watch it,'' Chicago Bears quarterback Rex Grossman said. ''I didn't see the hold or anything.''  What happened next sent Chicago into celebration. Thanks to Gould's 49-yard field goal, the longest in Bears postseason history, Chicago edged the Seattle Seahawks, 27-24, and will play host to the New Orleans Saints next Sunday for the National Football Conference championship.  Gould's kick, which came 4 minutes 58 seconds into overtime and equaled his career long, did more than just win a playoff game. It lifted a psychological burden from the Bears, who had been beaten at home during their previous two playoff appearances and had not won a playoff game since Jan. 1, 1995. Had the Bears lost this game, it would have cheapened their 13-3 regular season and their N.F.C. North title, sending them into another off-season feeling as if they had underachieved.  Instead, Chicago has a chance to reach the Super Bowl for the first time in 21 seasons. The Bears were far from dominant against the Seahawks, allowing running back Shaun Alexander to rush for 108 yards, and falling behind, 24-21, in the fourth quarter. But when it mattered, Gould delivered. He kicked a 41-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to tie the score, then followed with his game-winner.  The Bears mobbed Gould afterward, knowing that his kick had liberated them from heavy criticism.  ''We didn't play good the whole game, we played good enough to win,'' Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher said. ''It's like a monkey off our back. That was a good big kick -- bad field, 49 yards, windy. That's why he's first-team All-Pro.''  Gould has been a clutch performer for the Bears all season, making his first 24 field-goal attempts, and 32 of 36 over all during the regular season. On Dec. 17, Gould kicked a 25-yard field goal to defeat Tampa Bay in overtime.  Despite the pressure and the importance of Sunday's kick, he tried to treat it as routinely as possible.  ''It wasn't an easy kick, but you want the opportunity,'' said Gould, in his second season with the Bears since going undrafted out of Penn State.  ''This is obviously a big win for our team, keeping our season alive.''  For Chicago, it was a narrow escape. Gould's winning field goal completed the Bears' first possession in overtime, after Seattle won the overtime coin toss but stalled on its drive. Seahawks punter Ryan Plackemeier muffed a punt that traveled only 18 yards, giving the Bears a first down on their 34-yard line. Moments later, Grossman (21 for 38, 282 yards, one touchdown, one interception) completed a key 30-yard pass to Rashied Davis, and the Bears eventually drove to Seattle's 32, setting up Gould's winning kick.  The Bears will play in the conference championship game for the first time since the 1988 season.  Most of the pregame focus was on Grossman's inconsistent play all season, but this game was about all of the Bears. After last season's playoff loss, 29-21 to Carolina, the Bears came back strong, finishing with the best record in the conference. But another one-and-done playoff experience would have been more anguishing.  ''Last night I talked to the team about finishing,'' Bears Coach Lovie Smith said. ''Last year we were in this position, and we weren't able to finish the season the way we wanted. We talked about all we've gone through this year, how it would be a shame not to finish the game on a high note.''  The Seahawks did not go easily. Trailing by 21-14 at halftime, Seattle scored 10 consecutive points to take its first lead. After a 40-yard field goal by Josh Brown cut Seattle's deficit to 21-17, the Seahawks put together a seven-play, 51-yard touchdown drive. On third-and-10 from Chicago's 13-yard line, Alexander found a gaping hole in Chicago's defensive line and rumbled into the end zone, putting the Seahawks ahead, 24-21, with just under five minutes left in the third quarter.  One could almost hear the doubt creeping into Soldier Field when Seattle took the lead, but the Bears showed their resiliency. Grossman's pass was intercepted by Pete Hunter deep in Seattle's territory to end a drive early in the fourth quarter, but the Bears did not panic.  Chicago almost took the lead a few minutes later, but an apparent 66-yard punt return for a touchdown by Devin Hester was nullified because of an illegal block in the back. Once again, the Bears responded, driving 48 yards to Seattle's 23, setting up Gould's 41-yard field goal into the wind that barely sneaked over the crossbar with 4:24 left in regulation, tying the score.  The Seahawks had chances to win in regulation, but they were thwarted on their final two fourth-quarter possessions. Just after the two-minute warning, Seattle had fourth-and-1 from Chicago's 44. Seahawks Coach Mike Holmgren elected to go for the first down, but the play's timing was thrown off after Matt Hasselbeck bobbled the snap. When Alexander finally received the handoff from Hasselbeck, he was thrown for a 2-yard loss by linebacker Lance Briggs.  After stopping the Bears and getting the ball back, the Seahawks threatened again, driving from their 20 to Chicago's 45 with 30 seconds left in regulation. But Chicago defensive tackle Tank Johnson, who was arrested last month on misdemeanor weapons charges, sacked Hasselbeck for a 9-yard loss with 24 seconds to play in regulation.  ''We know what Tank is as a football player,'' Urlacher said. ''It was a big play.''  Time expired in regulation, and after the Bears stopped Seattle and got the ball in overtime, Grossman set up Gould's kick with his 30-yard completion to Davis.  ''The pattern was open all game,'' Davis said. ''Rex was waiting for a big play to come my way. I'm just elated.''  All the Bears were elated, because their season was still alive.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Stephanie Robinson Davis and Randy Davis are young parents just starting out. There can be a lot to learn, but in the Davises' house, they already know that their children come first.  ''I try my best to give them everything I didn't have,'' said Mr. Davis, 27. ''I want them to have a stable home. I never really had a stable home because I was in and out of foster care.''  Nyliyah, 2, danced around the coffee table. ''Me comfortable,'' she said in a singsong voice.  Ms. Davis, 26, laughed at her daughter's energy, saying, ''It's got to be the Froot Loops.''  The couple's other child, Shymell, 4, named for his quiet nature, even as a baby, watched the action from one corner of the immaculate living room, which Ms. Davis had carefully decorated and scrubbed to a shine.  As children, Mr. and Ms. Davis both spent years in foster care. Their cheerful home is proof of the new path they are making for their own children. The road has not always been easy.  Mr. Davis was born in 1980. He said drugs were booming then, and ''my mother, she was really on it hard.'' He was raised mostly by his grandmother, who died when he was 11. He was then placed in a foster home in the Bronx.  Meanwhile, Ms. Davis landed in foster care herself as her mother battled her own addictions and abusive relationships. Still, throughout the nearly 12 years that she was in foster care, her mother fought to stay in her life. ''My mother always made sure that we was close, always,'' Ms. Davis said.  She is the oldest of eight children and fiercely protective of her siblings. ''I know what it's like to be a mother. It's easy to take care of my children because I know what it's like to be a mother since a very young age,'' she said.  Throughout their tumultuous childhoods, both of the Davises found an adult they could count on: Jean Marie De Veaux, education coordinator at the Family Foster Care program of the Children's Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  ''I've been knowing her since I was a itty-bitty little person,'' Ms. Davis said. Ms. De Veaux provided information about schools, scholarships, jobs and bill-paying. Anything the Davises needed to know, they went to Ms. De Veaux.  Mr. Davis said: ''If I needed help, she was there for me. I love Miss Jean Marie De Veaux.''  The couple met as young adults at a day care center where they were both working in jobs they got through the Children's Aid Society. Ms. Davis had been hired full time after completing an internship, and Mr. Davis was working there during breaks from college at Norfolk State University in Virginia.  In May 2002, Mr. Davis left school about a semester short of graduation. Ms. Davis was pregnant with Shymell, and Mr. Davis would not think of her going through pregnancy alone, nor of his child's life beginning without him. Mr. Davis hopes to complete his degree and says he misses college. ''I wanted to be a social worker; that's what I majored in,'' he said.  Mr. Davis ended up working in construction, even though the income was quite unstable and he found the work unsatisfying. Ms. Davis was a seasonal Parks Department employee.  Their lives became even more of a struggle one day in March when Ms. Davis's mother died suddenly from a heart problem. Ms. Davis took on more family responsibility. Her savings went to cover funeral costs and to help provide for her younger siblings.  Her 3-year-old brother, Malikk, is of the greatest concern. She is helping her oldest brother care for him now. ''We all have to decide what we're going to do right now to keep this family together,'' Ms. Davis said. Her brother Alfred Robinson, 19, also sometimes lives with the Davises.  ''I wouldn't trade it in for a minute, because they all give me some type of support,'' she said.  Ms. Davis's job came to an end for the season in March, coincidentally on the day her mother died. The aftermath has derailed her search for a new job.  The Davises receive $345 in food stamps each month and $119.50 in public assistance. The $184 rent on their two-bedroom apartment in Harlem is covered by public assistance.  By the fall, construction work for Mr. Davis had slowed and the family was struggling to keep up. They turned to Ms. De Veaux for help. She used $605.59 in Neediest Cases money: $300 for clothing vouchers for the children, $152 for two monthly MetroCards for continuing job searches and $153.59 toward part of a phone bill.  The Children's Aid Society also helped with employment. On Nov. 14, Mr. Davis started working part time at the organization's P.S. 8 Community Schools program. ''I love it. I love working with kids,'' he said. He hopes to do more. ''If they put me full time, I'd jump and touch the sky.''  With a little help from Neediest Cases, and continuing help from Ms. De Veaux, the Davises are making it.  Ms. De Veaux said, ''When they had each of their babies, I watched them trying to recreate the love and stability that they missed out on, in part. This is such a success story, I think, from foster care because they've been through a lot.  ''This is what marriage is. This is what commitment is. It's not what you see in the movies.''

                    "text": "  Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Monday that Iran would not back down from developing its nuclear program, despite sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council last month.  Ayatollah Khamenei, 67, has the final word on state matters, including nuclear policies.  He was making his first public appearance since rumors spread on several Web sites on Thursday that he had died.  ''The Iranian people will definitely not give up their right and the authorities have no right to give up this great achievement,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said, addressing a crowd in Qum, 82 miles south of Tehran.  The Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 with sanctions intended to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes but the United States and some European nations contend is for the purpose of creating nuclear weapons. The measure bars the trade of goods or technology related to Iran's nuclear program. Enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear fuel but also for making nuclear weapons.  The resolution also gave Iran a two-month deadline to halt the program or face tougher sanctions.  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has also brushed off the resolution and vowed that Iran will not suspend the nuclear program.  In his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei also warned neighboring Arab countries not to join an alliance with the United States and Britain against Iran.  ''The nuclear program is a native achievement and is a source of pride for Iran and the Islamic world,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said.  ''If some Arab and Islamic governments think that by joining an alliance with Britain and the United States and imposing sanctions on Iran they can earn the satisfaction of the Zionist regime, they should know that they are making a political blunder,'' he said.

                    "text": "  The McCormick Tribune Foundation, the second-largest shareholder in the Tribune Company, said yesterday that it had hired a buyout firm to advise it on a course of action while the Tribune Company is on the block.  The foundation's five directors are all current or former members of the Tribune Company management and could influence the company's decision whether to sell some or all of its assets. The foundation and the company said they had taken steps to avoid any conflicts of interest.  A person close to the process said bids for the company were due Jan. 17. Its assets include The Los Angeles Times, 10 other newspapers, two dozen television stations and the Chicago Cubs.  Joseph A. Hays, a spokesman for the foundation, said it had hired the Blackstone Group buyout firm as part of its fiduciary responsibilities because 75 percent of the value of the foundation is in Tribune stock. Blackstone is to review the company's financial information and advise it on a course of action.  ''It's a full range of opportunities, from standing pat to divesting stock to acquiring stock, and in between there is infinity,'' Mr. Hays said.  The McCormack Foundation, founded at the death of Col. Robert R. McCormick in 1955, finances an array of charities. It has an 11.7 percent stake in Tribune. The Cantigny Foundation, which is associated with the McCormick Foundation and owns 1.4 percent of the shares, has joined in retaining Blackstone.  Tribune's biggest shareholder is the Chandler family, which owns 20 percent and has expressed interest in buying the company.  The foundation said it had set up a special advisory committee of two of its five board members to direct Blackstone's work. Those two -- James C. Dowdle and John W. Madigan -- are retired Tribune executives. The other three are current members of the Tribune Company management: Dennis FitzSimons, chairman and chief executive; Scott C. Smith, president of Tribune publishing; and David Hiller, publisher of The Los Angeles Times. Colonel McCormick stipulated in his will that the foundation's directors be current or former officers of the Tribune Company, but that has raised questions of potential conflicts of interest.  Daniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a watchdog group in Chicago, said it was not clear where the board's interests began and the company's interests left off. He said it was unusual for a foundation to have so much of its assets invested in one company. He also questioned whether only two of the five directors could decide the foundation's course of action, given that they do not constitute a majority.  In a regulatory filing yesterday, the foundation said that the three current executives ''have been isolated from this process on behalf of the foundation,'' referring to the potential sale of Tribune. In addition, Mr. FitzSimons sent an internal note to employees saying, ''Given our role as current officers of the company, Scott, David and I have voluntarily recused ourselves from any deliberations regarding alternatives'' for the foundation's investment in the Tribune Company.  Mr. Hays said that Mr. Madigan owned stock in Tribune and that Mr. Dowdle did not. He said Mr. Madigan's stock ownership did not pose a conflict because ''his interests are aligned with the foundation.''  Until recently, Mr. Madigan was a special partner at Madison Dearborn, a private equity firm that is considering a bid for Tribune; the firm said yesterday he had left to avoid any appearance of a conflict.  Late in the day, the foundation said it was receiving so many questions about its intentions in establishing an advisory committee that it issued a statement saying the move ''should in no way be construed as a reflection on the management of Tribune Company.'' The committee, it said, ''continues to have complete confidence in Tribune Company management.''  As a philanthropic organization, the foundation could not make a bid itself for Tribune because it has no cash. But it could participate in a deal with a private equity firm or another company. ''This is where a financial adviser would be helpful,'' a person close to the process said.  The Chandlers started the process that led to the auction of the Tribune Company when they expressed displeasure last year at the company's slumping stock price and said management was muddled. The Tribune Company said it would examine its strategic options, including the sale of part or all of its assets.  Correction:  January 6, 2007, Saturday  A picture caption in Business Day yesterday about a decision by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, a large shareholder in the Tribune Company, to hire the Blackstone Group as an adviser while the Tribune is up for sale, misstated the role of the company's chief executive, Dennis FitzSimons, in the sales process. Mr. FitzSimons, who is also chairman of the foundation's board, has recused himself from issues regarding the sale; he is not a member of the special committee dealing with the Blackstone Group.  ",

Asians and girls and the children of parents who are married, make the most money, have advanced academic degrees and live in the suburbs of the Northeast.  Those are also likely to be the same students who say they are most interested in their schoolwork and often work hard in school.  Which are most likely to be enrolled in programs for gifted students? Children of better-educated parents. If one imagined a category combining the leading factors, it would be the daughters of married couples from the suburbs in the South whose parents' income was above the poverty level.  Those are some of the findings in the Census Bureau's analysis, ''A Child's Day,'' released this month. The report surveyed parents nationwide to analyze benchmarks of well-being for 73 million children under 18 from a 2003 review of income and participation in various government assistance programs.  The report also measured characteristics of students enrolled in gifted programs. Among students younger than 12 enrolled in such programs, the largest group was non-Hispanic white. Among older students, Asians were the most numerous in gifted programs.  The biggest differential was linked to their parents' level of educational achievement. The proportion of 12- to- 17-year-olds in gifted classes ranged from 10 percent of those whose parents had never completed high school to 45 percent of those whose parents had an advanced degree.  Many of the differentials in the report were predictable, on the basis of other surveys, and were relatively slight. Still, some stood out.  Among racial and ethnic groups, non-Hispanic white parents were most likely to say their children never like school, while Asian parents, followed by Hispanic parents, were most likely to say their children like it often. The children of parents who were separated, divorced or widowed were most likely to never like school. Children whose parent worked part-time generally like school most often. Those growing up in rural areas like it less often.  More parents of Asian and non-Hispanic white teenagers said their children had repeated a grade. The percentage who had ever been suspended -- 13.4 percent overall -- barely differed regardless of race, income and other variables.  ",

These boxy-looking new minivans are the long-awaited fifth generation production models. Really.  What's the point? Though sales are fading quickly, minivans are still relatively big sellers at the Chrysler Group, which essentially invented the segment 24 years ago.  What they said: In a poke at Ford and General Motors, Thomas W. LaSorda, chief executive of the Chrysler Group, said, ''If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen -- we're about to turn up the heat in the minivan kitchen.''  What they didn't say: The minivan segment has never really recovered from Chrysler's killing of Plymouth and the very popular Voyager minivan in 2001. Minivan-based crossovers are the next big thing.  What makes it tick? Either a 3.3-liter flexible-fuel V-6 bolted to a four-speed automatic transmission, or choices of a 3.8- or a 4.0-liter V-6 (with 240 horsepower) coupled to a minivan-first six-speed automatic.  How much, how soon? The new minivans should start around $20,000 and top out at $40,000 loaded (with geegaws like swiveling seats, plug-in tables and two separate DVD systems) when they appear this fall as '08 models.  How's it look? The interiors are high-tech and very entertaining. The exteriors? Yawn.  FIRST GLANCE  ",

You can talk to anyone on your Skype buddy list or make inexpensive national and international calls over Skype's network without having to use your own computer.  The phone includes a cordless handset that uses D.E.C.T. (digital enhanced cordless telecommunications) technology to reduce interference from other wireless networks and improve call quality. It also has a small color screen that shows a list of Skype contacts or caller ID information, depending on the network being used.  The phone is priced at $199 and is available now at major online and retail stores. Additional handsets are extra and will be available later this year.  JOHN BIGGS  CIRCUITS  ",

The difference between high-powered high schools like those mentioned in the article (merely 68 schools supplied over 20 percent of Yale's 2006 freshman class) and mine, where the college counselor had not heard of the top-ranked liberal arts colleges where I applied, is not academic; it's social.  Many classmates from schools like Andover and Dalton arrive at college fighting to get into the most selective major and singing group and, later, the best law school and investment bank -- realms that preserve the ''I'll take you down'' moral certitude they learned in high school. That the viability of this culture of competitiveness is limited to these few domains comes as a surprise to some of them.  Phoebe Rounds  Rochester, Jan. 8, 2007  ",

                    "text": "  North Carolina's attorney general said Saturday that his office would immediately assume control of the Duke lacrosse sexual assault case referred to him on Friday by the Durham County district attorney.  ''I wish I could tell you that this case would be resolved quickly,'' the attorney general, Roy A. Cooper, said at a news conference here on Saturday afternoon. ''Since we have not been involved in the investigation or the prosecution of these cases, all of the information will be new to our office. Any case with such serious criminal charges requires a careful and deliberate review.''  The district attorney, Michael B. Nifong, had asked Mr. Cooper to take over the prosecution, citing the conflict of interest he faced from having to respond to an ethics complaint from the North Carolina Bar Association. Mr. Nifong was ''very disappointed'' at giving up the case, his lawyer, David B. Freedman, said Saturday, but pleased with Mr. Cooper's assignment of two veteran prosecutors.  Defense lawyers and families of the defendants welcomed the news that the case would be in the hands of the attorney general's office.  ''We are taking a completely new, fresh look at this case, so anything could happen,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''We are looking at all the facts. Whatever charges, if any, are appropriate, they will be pursued.''  Mr. Cooper said his office would obtain the case files next week and then meet with defense lawyers and reinterview witnesses, including the accuser. He said he did not know if a pretrial hearing scheduled for Feb. 5 would have to be postponed.  Mr. Cooper, 49, a Democrat, is a former legislator who wrote a crime victim's bill of rights. He is serving his second term and has announced plans to run for re-election in 2008.  He assigned James J. Coman, head of the attorney general's Law Enforcement and Prosecutions Division, and Mary D. Winstead of the Special Prosecutions Division, to the case. But Mr. Cooper said he would make the final decisions in the case.  ''We accept the case with our eyes wide open to the evidence, but with blinders on for all other distractions,'' Mr. Cooper said.  From the start, the Duke case has been politically charged by race and class. A black woman hired to strip at a Duke lacrosse team party last March 13 accused three white students of gang rape. Protests erupted, and Mr. Nifong expressed with a certainty that a crime had occurred.  But in the last 10 months, his case floundered as defense lawyers offered time-stamped photographs challenging the stripper's account, prosecution reports highlighting the lack of DNA evidence and inconsistencies in the woman's story. Defense lawyers have insisted that the woman, 28, is a false accuser and have painted Mr. Nifong, 55, as a renegade with political motives.  Sexual offense and kidnapping charges are pending against Collin Finnerty, 20, of Garden City, N.Y.; Reade W. Seligmann, of Essex Fells, N.J.; and David F. Evans, 23, of Annapolis, Md. The three were initially charged with rape, but Mr. Nifong dismissed that charge after the accuser told an investigator she could not be sure what had penetrated her.  ",

                    "text": "  Intel reported yesterday that fourth-quarter profit fell 39 percent as the company continued to fight for market share and to absorb the high cost of its corporate overhaul.  The company, the world's largest chip maker and a closely watched indicator of the overall strength of the technology industry, reported slightly higher sales than Wall Street predicted, although they were still down 5 percent from the period last year.  But on the critical measurement of gross profit margin, Intel clearly disappointed, indicating the price war with its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices continued to take a toll.  Intel projected that its gross profit margin would be about 49 percent during the first quarter of 2007, down from 49.6 percent during the fourth quarter of 2006. Intel estimated that gross profit margin would be only about 50 percent for all of 2007. That compares with a gross profit margin of 61.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.  ''These results were clearly mixed,'' said Adam Parker, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''People wanted to see that gross margins had reached the bottom in the fourth quarter, but they didn't.''  The report was released after the market's close yesterday, but investors reacted strongly to the forecast of a lower profit margin, sending shares of Intel down 88 cents, or nearly 4 percent, in after-hours trading. Earlier in the day, Intel shares rose 17 cents, to close at $22.30 in regular trading.  Intel's net income for the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion, or 26 cents a share, including the cost associated with stock option expenses. In last year's fourth quarter, the last quarter in which it expensed stock options, Intel posted net income of $2.45 billion, or 40 cents a share.  The company's revenue declined 5 percent, to $9.69 billion, from $10.2 billion last year, at the top of the range of $9.1 billion to $9.7 billion the company had forecast.  Analysts were expecting earnings of 25 cents a share on $9.44 billion in revenue, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial.  For 2006, Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., posted revenue of $35.4 billion, while its net income was $5 billion, or 86 cents a share.  Closing what he called ''a very tough pricing year,'' Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, indicated that Intel would continue to price aggressively this year. ''We're going to have to fight to win orders,'' Mr. Bryant said in a conference call with analysts.  The brightest spot for Intel was that it sold record numbers of its highest-priced microprocessors, those used in computer servers. Sales of those chips helped drive up Intel's average selling price during a period in which Intel was continuing to cut prices on older products.  Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, described 2006 as a unique year in which the company introduced 40 new products. ''We've never had that broad a base of new products all at once,'' Mr. Otellini said in the conference call.  Intel's report of higher selling prices on server chips was in stark contrast to news from A.M.D. last week. That company, which is scheduled to issue its earnings report on Jan. 23, warned last week that its fourth-quarter revenue would miss Wall Street forecasts because of lower unit prices.  A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to be about $1.37 billion, or only about 3 percent above the third-quarter level. The news sent shares of A.M.D down $1.92, to $18.26, on Friday. Yesterday, A.M.D. shares declined 23 cents, or about 1 percent, in after-hours trading, after declining 13 cents, to close at $18.13, during the regular session.  Intel said it was also facing the high cost of its transition to a major new manufacturing process, a transition that occurs roughly every two years. Mr. Bryant said the bulk of the costs of the manufacturing changes would occur in the first half of 2007.  Looking ahead, Intel said first-quarter revenue would be $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion, in line with analysts' forecast of $8.93 billion. Mr. Bryant declined to provide a full-year forecast.  In September, the company announced a major revamping, including the elimination of 10,500 positions. Intel ended the fourth quarter with 94,100 employees, down more than 6,000 from the second quarter. Costs associated with layoffs decreased earnings by about 1.5 cents a share in the fourth quarter, the company said.  ",

                    "text": "  Ten Southeast Asian countries meeting here are hammering out a regional antiterrorism agreement, officials said Thursday, the day after a series of terrorist bombings in the southern Philippines underscored the need for such a measure.  ''The terrorists merely accomplished the opposite of what they wanted,'' said Victoriano Lecaros, a Philippine government spokesman. ''The attacks only emphasized the need to address terrorism in Southeast Asia. There is now a renewed urgency to deal with terrorism.''  Leaders of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, will consider the measure, the Asean Convention on Counterterrorism, at their annual summit meeting here on Saturday. The agreement aims to improve information and intelligence sharing among the group's members and encourage them to adopt domestic antiterrorism laws, officials said.  ''Global terrorism has assumed new forms of virulence, and we will make sure that the community is more secure and resistant to the threat of terror,'' said Alberto Romulo, the Philippine foreign minister.  Bombs ripped through three southern cities here on Wednesday night, killing eight people and wounding dozens, the police said. No group claimed responsibility, but two radical Islamist groups, Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah, are suspected, an official said, because they were behind similar bombings in the past.  Foreign ministers meeting here before the summit meeting discussed the convention on Wednesday night. Opponents of the antiterrorism agreement fear that it could be used to suppress human rights.  One result of the discussions was that Indonesia invited several countries, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia, to meet in March to discuss terrorism.  The attacks Wednesday in the southern region of Mindanao, where there is an active Islamist separatist movement, followed claims by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in recent weeks that her government had made progress fighting terrorists.  ''They were trying to send a message,'' said Oscar Calderon, the chief of the national police, referring to the attackers. ''They wanted to embarrass the government because of the meetings in Cebu.''  The Philippine police and military have been receiving help from the United States and Australia in fighting Abu Sayyaf, which has been giving refuge to Jemaah Islamiyah members. Jemaah Islamiyah is a Southeast Asian terrorism network that originated in Indonesia and was said to be behind the 2002 Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people.  ",

                    "text": "  Families earning more than $1 million a year saw their federal tax rates drop more sharply than any group in the country as a result of President Bush's tax cuts, according to a new Congressional study.  The study, by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, also shows that tax rates for middle-income earners edged up in 2004, the most recent year for which data was available, while rates for people at the very top continued to decline.  Based on an exhaustive analysis of tax records and census data, the study reinforced the sense that while Mr. Bush's tax cuts reduced rates for people at every income level, they offered the biggest benefits by far to people at the very top -- especially the top 1 percent of income earners.  Though tax cuts for the rich were bigger than those for other groups, the wealthiest families paid a bigger share of total taxes. That is because their incomes have climbed far more rapidly, and the gap between rich and poor has widened in the last several years.  The study offers ammunition to supporters and opponents of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which are all but certain to touch off a battle between the president and the Democrats who just took control of Congress.  Democratic leaders have taken pains to avoid an immediate fight over the tax cuts, most of which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. But Democrats are looking for ways to increase revenue well before then, in part because they want to spend more on education and energy without increasing the deficit.  Economists and tax analysts have long known that the biggest dollar value of Mr. Bush's tax cuts goes to people at the very top income levels. One reason is that two of his signature measures, tax cuts on investment income and a steady reduction of estate taxes, overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest households.  But the Congressional study offers additional insight because it incorporates information about what people paid in 2004, the first year in which taxpayers could take full advantage of the cuts on stock dividends and capital gains.  The study estimates that the effective federal income tax rate, which excludes payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, declined modestly for people in the middle- and lower-income categories.  Families in the middle fifth of annual earnings, who had average incomes of $56,200 in 2004, saw their average effective tax rate edge down to 2.9 percent in 2004 from 5 percent in 2000. That translated to an average tax cut of $1,180 per household, but the tax rate actually increased slightly from 2003.  Tax cuts were much deeper, and affected far more money, for families in the highest income categories. Households in the top 1 percent of earnings, which had an average income of $1.25 million, saw their effective individual tax rates drop to 19.6 percent in 2004 from 24.2 percent in 2000. The rate cut was twice as deep as for middle-income families, and it translated to an average tax cut of almost $58,000.  In its report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the overall effective federal tax rate edged up to 20 percent in 2004, from 19.8 percent the year before.  But even with that increase, Americans faced lower tax rates than any time since 1979. If President Bush has his way, those rates could decline even more as the estate tax on inherited wealth is gradually phased out by the start of 2010.  Mr. Bush and his Republican allies in Congress want to permanently extend that tax cut and almost all of the others that Congress passed in his first term. The cost of doing that would be more than $1 trillion over the next decade, a cost that would hit the Treasury at the same time that the spending on old-age benefits for retiring baby boomers begins to soar.  The budget office offered little commentary on its new estimates, but many of its numbers spoke for themselves.  The report shows that a comparatively small number of very wealthy households account for a very big share of total tax payments, and their share increased in the first four years after Mr. Bush's tax cuts.  The top 1 percent of income earners paid about 36.7 percent of federal income taxes and 25.3 percent of all federal taxes in 2004. The top 20 percent of income earners paid 67.1 percent of all federal taxes, up from 66.1 percent in 2000, according to the budget office.  By contrast, families in the bottom 40 percent of income earners, those with incomes below $36,300, typically paid no federal income tax and received money back from the government. That so-called negative income tax stemmed mainly from the earned-income tax credit, a program that benefits low-income parents who are employed.  Put another way: rich families were the undisputed winners from President Bush's tax cuts, but people in the bottom half of the earnings scale were not paying much in taxes anyway.  ",

                    "text": "  A New Jersey lawyer pleaded not guilty to prostitution and money-laundering charges yesterday as his lawyer accused the Manhattan district attorney of letting his ''personal feelings'' influence the prosecution.  An assistant district attorney, Linda Ford, said during the arraignment of the lawyer, Paul W. Bergrin, that he had not only helped run a brothel at 79 Worth Street in Lower Manhattan but had patronized the establishment and had brought friends to the brothel for free sex.  But a lawyer for Mr. Bergrin, Jeffrey Lichtman, accused the district attorney's office of inflating the seriousness of the charges by asking that his client be held in jail without bail.  ''Counsel can only surmise that the tremendous publicity surrounding this case and the district attorney's personal feelings toward the defendant have influenced the draconian request for detention,'' Mr. Lichtman wrote in a brief.  Justice Michael R. Ambrecht of State Supreme Court in Manhattan later set Mr. Bergrin's bail at $1 million bond or $500,000 cash, with 72 hours for prosecutors to review the source of the money.  A spokesman for District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau declined to comment yesterday.  Mr. Bergrin, 51, of Morganville, N.J., is a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. He is accused of using two shell companies in 2004 and 2005 to launder $800,000 in credit card receipts from a call girl service based in TriBeCa named NY Confidential, prosecutors have said.  Mr. Lichtman said that Jason Itzler, the brothel's founder and Mr. Bergrin's client, had been accused of laundering millions in prostitution money -- as opposed to the $800,000 Mr. Bergrin is accused of laundering.  Yet Mr. Itzler was released on $250,000 bail after his indictment in 2005, and was sentenced last week to one and a half to three years in prison, Mr. Lichtman said.  ",

Mr. Webb did not say at that point in the conversation, ''That's between me and my boy, Mr. President.'' Mr. Webb did not make that statement until after Mr. Bush had said of the Iraq comment: ''That's not what I asked you. How's your boy?''

Nine of these summarize Baudelaire's life and poetry and only two discuss the translation at all, if only briefly. The ratio might well be reversed, so that readers might have a better idea of the translation and its relation to the originals.  David C. Garron  Wilmette, Ill.  To the Editor  Thank you for publishing Joshua Clover's brilliant review of Keith Waldrop's translation of Baudelaire. It was a delight to read such a thorough and knowledgeable consideration of poetry in the Book Review.  Louis Asekoff  Tivoli, N.Y.  ",

Declining just a half-million viewers from its record Tuesday start, the second night of ''Idol'' gave Fox one of its highest-rated Wednesdays ever. For the night, Fox once again trounced its competition, faring 79 percent better among adults 18 to 49 than NBC, ABC, CBS and CW combined. CBS was No. 2 for the night, as ''Criminal Minds'' at 9 (13.4 million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10 (13.7 million) drew solid audiences. CBS's ''Armed and Famous'' (6.1 million) finished third in the 8 p.m. hour, behind two episodes of ''According to Jim'' on ABC (6.9 million).  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

                    "text": "  North Carolina's attorney general said Saturday that his office would immediately assume control of the Duke lacrosse sexual assault case referred to him on Friday by the Durham County district attorney.  ''I wish I could tell you that this case would be resolved quickly,'' the attorney general, Roy A. Cooper, said at a news conference here on Saturday afternoon. ''Since we have not been involved in the investigation or the prosecution of these cases, all of the information will be new to our office. Any case with such serious criminal charges requires a careful and deliberate review.''  The district attorney, Michael B. Nifong, had asked Mr. Cooper to take over the prosecution, citing the conflict of interest he faced from having to respond to an ethics complaint from the North Carolina Bar Association. Mr. Nifong was ''very disappointed'' at giving up the case, his lawyer, David B. Freedman, said Saturday, but pleased with Mr. Cooper's assignment of two veteran prosecutors.  Defense lawyers and families of the defendants welcomed the news that the case would be in the hands of the attorney general's office.  ''We are taking a completely new, fresh look at this case, so anything could happen,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''We are looking at all the facts. Whatever charges, if any, are appropriate, they will be pursued.''  Mr. Cooper said his office would obtain the case files next week and then meet with defense lawyers and reinterview witnesses, including the accuser. He said he did not know if a pretrial hearing scheduled for Feb. 5 would have to be postponed.  Mr. Cooper, 49, a Democrat, is a former legislator who wrote a crime victim's bill of rights. He is serving his second term and has announced plans to run for re-election in 2008.  He assigned James J. Coman, head of the attorney general's Law Enforcement and Prosecutions Division, and Mary D. Winstead of the Special Prosecutions Division, to the case. But Mr. Cooper said he would make the final decisions in the case.  ''We accept the case with our eyes wide open to the evidence, but with blinders on for all other distractions,'' Mr. Cooper said.  From the start, the Duke case has been politically charged by race and class. A black woman hired to strip at a Duke lacrosse team party last March 13 accused three white students of gang rape. Protests erupted, and Mr. Nifong expressed with a certainty that a crime had occurred.  But in the last 10 months, his case floundered as defense lawyers offered time-stamped photographs challenging the stripper's account, prosecution reports highlighting the lack of DNA evidence and inconsistencies in the woman's story. Defense lawyers have insisted that the woman, 28, is a false accuser and have painted Mr. Nifong, 55, as a renegade with political motives.  Sexual offense and kidnapping charges are pending against Collin Finnerty, 20, of Garden City, N.Y.; Reade W. Seligmann, of Essex Fells, N.J.; and David F. Evans, 23, of Annapolis, Md. The three were initially charged with rape, but Mr. Nifong dismissed that charge after the accuser told an investigator she could not be sure what had penetrated her.  ",

                    "text": "  A fierce clash left at least 30 people dead in central Baghdad late Saturday night as Iraqi Army forces fought with gunmen in an area where several residents had been killed and their bodies hanged from street lampposts, the Iraqi military said.  The fighting took place in the neighborhood around Haifa Street, a mostly Sunni Arab enclave with a small Shiite population.  A spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Muhammad al-Askari, said that an Iraqi Army unit had gone into the area after receiving reports that Sunni fighters had set up a fake security checkpoint and were taking Shiites aside and shooting them.  The bodies of many of those killed at the roadblock were then hanged from the lampposts, Mr. Askari said.  He said that Iraqi soldiers had moved in and surrounded the fighters at the checkpoint. In initial fighting there, 30 of the men were killed and several more were arrested, Mr. Askari said, adding that the neighborhood remained locked down. There was no way to verify the figures.  Residents living nearby said that they were hearing continued fighting through the night but that it was impossible to know precisely what was happening.  In the same neighborhood, there were reports of clashes as government forces moved to collect 27 bodies dumped behind a local hospital. But it was unclear whether the firefight with Iraqi troops was related.  The government said Saturday that 72 bodies were recovered around the city on Saturday, most showing signs of torture.  Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki announced Saturday the beginning of a new Baghdad security operation and promised to purge the government security forces of militia fighters and others with sectarian aims.  But Mr. Maliki has promised such a crackdown before, and his government has been increasingly seen by Sunnis in Iraq and abroad as dominated by Shiite interests.  THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ  ",

                    "text": "  The decision by four of the five police officers involved in the killing of an unarmed Queens man to voluntarily speak to prosecutors, giving investigators their version of events for the first time, poses certain risks for both sides, lawyers and legal experts say.  By voluntarily talking with prosecutors, officers can often try to gain points as well as offer insights into their state of mind during a shooting, the experts said. The biggest risk to a police officer, however, is that once he tells a story, he is married to it and can only change it later at his peril. Prosecutors can attack any inconsistencies during subsequent grand jury proceedings or at trial, some defense lawyers and former prosecutors said.  While prosecutors face few pitfalls in questioning officers in such cases -- either before a grand jury proceeding, during it, or at both times -- they risk criticism doing it beforehand because of the potential for cozy dealings between prosecutors and the police, legal analysts said.  Michael Hardy, a lawyer for the family of Sean Bell, the Queens man who was killed, said yesterday that he was concerned by the officers parading in, one after another, to tell their stories to prosecutors in the office of the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. Mr. Bell died in a hail of 50 police bullets on Nov. 25, just hours before he was to be married.  ''What does concern me is to the extent that such meetings would have some undue influence on the prosecutors and how they present it to the grand jury,'' Mr. Hardy said. ''It has the appearance of impropriety only because of the general suspicion that exists within the general public about the closeness of the relationship between the district attorney and the police. And that is why it boils down to whether or not there is real integrity to the investigation, because it really will depend on how they use the information the officers give and how aggressively they use it in the grand jury.''  Those who represent the Bell family as well as the two men who were wounded in the shooting have also expressed outrage over what they see as a basic weakness in the criminal justice system: that district attorneys investigate cases of excessive use of force by the police, with whom they must work every day.  They want legislative change to provide for the appointment of a permanent special prosecutor in such cases.  The only one of the five officers who fired his gun in the Bell shooting who has not spoken to prosecutors is Detective Michael Oliver, 35, who fired 31 of the shots.  A lawyer for Detective Oliver did not return phone calls seeking comment and it remained unclear yesterday if the detective planned to testify before the grand jury or speak with prosecutors.  On Wednesday, an undercover detective who fired 11 shots told his story. His name has not been publicly disclosed. Earlier, prosecutors questioned Officer Michael Carey, 26, who fired three times; Detective Marc Cooper, 39, who fired four times; and Detective Paul Headley, 35, who fired one shot.  Kevin Ryan, a spokesman for Mr. Brown, declined to comment on the case or on any potential grand jury proceedings. ''The district attorney has said from the beginning, that it will be a full and thorough investigation,'' he said.  In recent years, most police officers involved in fatal shootings in New York have testified in front of grand juries. Voluntarily speaking to prosecutors, as these four police officers have done, is less common.  Officer Bryan Conroy, an undercover officer who shot and killed Ousmane Zongo during a raid in a Manhattan warehouse, spoke to prosecutors and the grand jury, but was indicted and convicted.  Officer Richard S. Neri, who fatally shot a teenager on a Brooklyn rooftop, testified before a grand jury, but did not speak to prosecutors ahead of time, and was not indicted.  Whether a police officer and his lawyer choose to tell his story to prosecutors can depend on the clarity of what happened and whether the shooting appears justified, several lawyers said. Some factors are: Did the person shot by the officer have a weapon? Was it recovered? Were there civilian witnesses? Will those witnesses back up his story?  Several lawyers and former officials agreed to speak about the Bell case, but only on the condition of anonymity, because the case is sensitive and continuing.  One former city prosecutor said that the decision by officers on whether to testify before a grand jury often depends on whether the case is considered ''a clean shoot.''  ''If it doesn't appear to be a good shoot, then they don't go in there,'' the former prosecutor said. ''It's a strategy issue with the lawyer and the cop: Do you want to create minutes that can be used to cross-examine you later at trial or that can limit the scope of your defense prematurely.''  If an officer believes he will be indicted no matter what, it may seem to make little sense to him to testify, though a strategy could be to testify and hope that an indictment would be for a lesser charge than second-degree murder.  Another strategy, particularly involving shootings with multiple officers, is to send officers who appear least exposed to criminality into the grand jury room first as a way of having their testimony speak for all involved.  ''This is a case where the officers will talk about their state of mind, what their fears are,'' Barry M. Kamins, a former Brooklyn prosecutor who is the president of the New York City Bar Association, said of the Bell case. ''The grand jury could not get this from any other source, no matter what the cold facts are. So the officers go in, they waive immunity, but it is always a gamble.''  He added, ''It is a gamble by the defense attorneys, but one I am sure they are taking after having reviewed the stories the officers are prepared to tell, prior to going in.''  How well an officer is received by grand jurors can depend on his own behavior, and whether he can articulate the facts that show the shooting to be justified, several lawyers and officials said. ''They want to see his mannerisms, they want to see remorse,'' said one lawyer who has represented officers in such cases.  ",

                    "text": "  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her Israeli counterpart declared their mutual backing on Saturday for a bilateral diplomatic strategy that would support moderate political leaders across the Middle East, but after a first evening of talks here offered little new to push ahead any agreement with the Palestinians.  Ms. Rice played down expectations for any breakthrough during her travels.  ''I expect this trip to really be one in which we have intensive consultations,'' she said to open weeklong travels across the Middle East and the Persian Gulf before consulting with allies in Western Europe. ''I'm not coming with a proposal. I'm not coming with a plan.''  The focus of her first two days is to push Israeli and Palestinian leaders to move forward on a number of smaller issues, and then she will speak with other regional allies to try to gather support for President Bush's new strategy for Iraq.  Tzipi Livni, the Israeli foreign minister, said after a meeting with Ms. Rice that the two countries were joined in an ''ongoing mutual effort to empower the moderates throughout the region in the struggle against extremism and terror.''  Asked to describe whether plans were being drawn to accelerate or skip portions of the long sidelined road map -- the 2002 plan backed by the United Nations, Russia, the United States and the European Union that describes sequential measures to be carried out by Israelis and Palestinians to reach a full political settlement -- Ms. Livni defended the process as balancing the need to give Palestinians ''a political horizon'' while cutting ''the process into phases.''  Ms. Rice sought to describe signs of optimism, especially after recent contacts between Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, and Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister.  ''I think there are openings now that are there as a result of this alignment, there as a result of the obvious desire of Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas to move forward,'' she said. ''So I think the opening is there, but I can't really judge until I've had a chance to really talk to all the interested parties how we can accelerate the road map, how quickly we can accelerate the road map and how we begin to talk about the political horizon that everybody is interested in.  In Palestinian developments on Saturday, the two main factions, Fatah and Hamas, were again stepping up efforts to form a unity government. The process has going on for months without agreement, and has frequently broken down amid street battles between the rivals.  But envoys for Mr. Abbas have been in contact with Hamas's exiled political chief, Khaled Mashal, who is in Damascus, Syria, Palestinian officials said.  Ismail Radwan, a Hamas spokesman in the Gaza Strip, said this was ''one of several Arab and Palestinian efforts to solve the differences.''  Mr. Radwan also said he believed that Mr. Abbas and Mr. Mashal were likely to meet relatively soon.  In a related matter, Mr. Abbas traveled from the West Bank city of Ramallah to neighboring Jordan to discuss the political developments with King Abdullah II, who has sought to mediate in the Palestinian infighting. Mr. Abbas returned to the West Bank later on Saturday, and will meet with Ms. Rice on Sunday.  A Palestinian unity government would seek to end the internecine fighting and establish a leadership acceptable to Western countries, which cut off financing after Hamas, the radical Islamic faction, came to power early last year. Hamas controls the current cabinet, though Mr. Abbas also has substantial powers as the president.  Also on Saturday, some 80,000 Palestinian government workers, about half of the total, agreed to end a strike that had lasted for months. Most of the striking workers are from the West Bank, and many are considered sympathetic to Fatah. In Gaza, where Hamas is much stronger, government workers have not gone on prolonged strikes.  The workers were protesting the government's inability to pay wages. The Hamas government has paid salaries only partly and sporadically because of the cutoff of money that previously came from the Western countries and from tax revenues collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinians.  The government workers are to receive one month's salary immediately, with overdue wages to be paid over the next six months, Palestinian officials said.  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, speaking on Palestinian television, said, ''The American and Israeli policies seek to push the Palestinian people toward civil war and internal conflict so that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict becomes a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict.''  ''I call on the Palestinian people and factions, in particular Hamas and Fatah, to halt internal clashes,'' Mr. Haniya said.  In Washington, the State Department said Friday that the Bush administration would seek Congressional approval for $86 million in ''nonlethal assistance'' to strengthen branches of the Palestinian security forces directly linked to Mr. Abbas.

                    "text": "  Twenty three schools in Westchester failed to meet requirements outlined by the federal No Child Left Behind law, including four schools that were newly identified as in need of improvement, the State Education Department announced last week.  They are Ossining High School, Greenburgh Eleven High School in Dobbs Ferry, Sleepy Hollow Middle School in Tarrytown and School 23 in Yonkers.  Schools are designated in need of improvement when students do not show enough progress on statewide tests in English and mathematics. For the first time this year, schools were judged on the scores of students in the third, fifth, sixth and seventh grades, in addition to fourth, eighth and 11th graders. Not only must schools show improvement over all, but they must also meet achievement targets for component groups, like racial categories and special education.  Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act, schools that receive federal money must replace administrators or close schools if they do not improve after several years. Roosevelt High School and Emerson Middle School in Yonkers have already reorganized, and two other Yonkers middle schools, Commerce and Museum, are planning to do so this year.  ''We made the decision to redesign Roosevelt so it became two schools, with designated administrative staff for each,'' said Jerilynne Fierstein, spokeswoman for the district. ''The idea is to personalize the instruction and stay more focused on the curriculum.''  The state also removed three schools from the list because of improvements in scores, including two high schools in Yonkers, Lincoln and Gorton, that reversed several consecutive years of failure. ''We are thrilled,'' Ms. Fierstein said. ''It was quite an accomplishment for the staffs of those schools.''  Schools that do not receive federal money are not subject to No Child Left Behind sanctions, but are required to meet state demands for improvement if their students do not meet targets. Twelve of the 23 failing schools are on that list, which is referred to as ''schools requiring academic progress.''  THE WEEK  ",

                    "text": "  I.B.M. reported quarterly profits and revenue yesterday that slightly surpassed Wall Street estimates, lifted by strong software sales and a solid performance from its big services unit.  The company's quarterly performance is an encouraging sign that I.B.M.'s strategy of betting that software can help fuel its services business is gaining ground.  In the past, analysts say, the company has tended to attain its profit targets through cost-cutting or a cyclical surge in its mainframe sales, while the underlying health of its services remained uncertain. Services account for nearly half of the company's revenue.  But the services business grew more than 6 percent, to $12.8 billion, and new services contracts signed during the quarter, an indicator of future revenue, rose 50 percent from a year ago, to $17.8 billion. Software sales rose 14 percent, to $5.6 billion.  ''This was a better, more balanced quarter than I.B.M. has delivered in a long time,'' said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Company.  Still, investors gave I.B.M. no credit for its quarterly results. In after-hours trading, I.B.M. shares fell more than 5 percent, down $5.60 a share, to $93.85. The company's shares closed the regular trading session at $99.45, off 57 cents,  Analysts attributed the fall in late trading mainly to the expectation by some investors that I.B.M. would considerably exceed the Wall Street consensus estimates, and to profit-taking by traders who have watched technology shares climb considerably in recent weeks.  ''Unless there was a strong upside surprise, they were selling,'' noted A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''Look what happened to Apple,'' whose shares fell despite reporting a record quarter on Wednesday.  I.B.M. reported quarterly net income of $3.54 billion, or $2.31 a share. That was 11 percent higher than the year-ago quarter, when the company earned $3.19 billion, or $1.99 a share. But excluding discontinued operations and tax gains, I.B.M.'s performance was not enough ahead of the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.19 a share to prevent the after-hours sell-off, Mr. Sacconaghi said.  Analysts said they also found the company's guidance for 2007 somewhat confusing. In a conference call with analysts, Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said that the Wall Street consensus projections for 2007 were reasonable, without being specific. The consensus estimate for the full year of 2007 is $6.60 a share, according to figures compiled by Thomson Financial.  But Mr. Loughridge also said he expected that I.B.M. would attain its long-term model of lifting earnings per share by 10 to 12 percent a year in 2007. A 10 percent gain over the 2006 performance suggests profits of $6.67 a share for 2007, Ms. Conigliaro noted.  Revenue in the quarter rose 7 percent, to $26.3 billion, but rose only 4 percent excluding the currency gains from a weaker dollar.  The software business was a particular bright spot for I.B.M., especially in newer technologies deemed strategically important to the company. For example, its Websphere products, which use Web standards and tools to build corporate software applications, increased sales by 22 percent.  Revenue from the hardware business edged up a modest 3 percent, to $7.1 billion, and would not have grown at all without currency gains. Sales of mainframes rose 5 percent, and revenue from industry-standard server computers, using personal computer technology, increased 7 percent. But minicomputer sales fell 10 percent.  I.B.M. is a huge company, with yearly revenue of more than $90 billion and many different businesses. Over all, Mr. Loughridge called the fourth quarter a ''strong finish'' to a good year, and most analysts agreed. ''It was a very solid quarter -- not a blowout, but very solid,'' said Mr. Sacconaghi of Bernstein.  ",

                    "text": "  The mezzo-soprano SUSAN GRAHAM is an eloquent interpreter of a large repertory, from German Classicism to contemporary American music. I could listen to her sing the phone book, but she is devoting her recital at Carnegie Hall on Monday to French art song, for which she has a particular affinity. With the pianist MALCOLM MARTINEAU supporting her, Ms. Graham will sing works, both beloved and obscure, by more than 20 composers, among them Bizet, Franck, Faur\u00e9, Lalo, Gounod, Debussy, Chausson, Duparc, Ravel, Honegger and Poulenc. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $80.  New music is plentiful this week, not least because the JUILLIARD SCHOOL's annual FOCUS FESTIVAL is under way. JOEL SACHS, who assembles and directs Focus, gives each year's concerts a unifying theme, sometimes stylistic, sometimes geographical. This year's series looks at contemporary Hungarian music, with ''contemporary'' defined as post-Bartok. Several of the featured composers -- Gyorgy Kurtag, Gyorgy Ligeti, Peter Eotvos and Istvan Marta, most notably -- are heard frequently in New York, but many of the others on the program are not. That's where to look for the surprising unknowns that Mr. Sachs invariably turns up. Monday through Friday at 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required on Friday.  Coincidentally JOHN SCOTT is presenting the complete organ works of Ligeti (and Jonathan Harvey) on Sunday afternoon at St. Thomas Church. Mr. Scott's concert is part of the Miller Theater's Ligeti tribute. At Miller itself the big draw this week is a Composer Portrait concert devoted to FRANK ZAPPA's classical works, as well as a few transcriptions of his experimental rock pieces, to be performed by the FIREWORKS ENSEMBLE and the ZEPHYROS WINDS. Sunday at 5:15 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street, (212) 854-7799; free. Friday at 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25, $15 for students.  Zappa is not the only rock star whose classical (or at least arguably classical) scores are being heard this week. DAVID BYRNE is represented as well, by his ''Songs From 'The Knee Plays,' '' composed in 1985 for a Robert Wilson production. Thursday at 9 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall; $35 to $45.  ",

                    "text": "  Prominent private citizens from Israel and Syria drafted a document in secret, unofficial talks that calls for returning the Golan Heights to Syria and offers a possible outline for peace negotiations, one of the participants said Tuesday.  However, the Israeli and Syrian governments dismissed the document, which was first described Tuesday in the Israeli daily Haaretz. They said they were not involved in the talks, which included sessions from September 2004 to July 2006 at undisclosed sites in Europe.  ''No one in the government was involved in this matter,'' Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel said. ''It was a private initiative.''  In Syria, Bushra Kanafani, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, told the Arab satellite network Al Jazeera that the Israeli report was ''mere fabrication and a test balloon.''  Israel and Syria last held formal peace talks in 2000, when they appeared close to a deal to return most or all of the Golan Heights to Syria. But the negotiations broke down, and the two countries routinely trade recriminations.  Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and later annexed it. Today, about 20,000 Israelis live in the Golan Heights, a sparsely populated region that includes farms, vineyards and tourist sites. It is considered to have strategic military value, rising far above both northern Israel and southern Syria.  With formal diplomatic efforts stalled in 2004, Alon Liel, a former director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, quietly began unofficial talks with Ibrahim Suleiman, a well-connected Syrian businessman who has been living near Washington.  Turkey helped to arrange the initial contacts, and an unidentified European mediator was involved in the talks throughout, Haaretz reported.  The document, written last summer, calls for Syria to regain the Golan Heights based on the border that existed before the 1967 war. While no timetable was set for an Israeli withdrawal, Haaretz reported that the two sides discussed 5 to 15 years.  The heights, which overlook much of northern Israel, would be demilitarized except for a limited police presence, the document says. A park would be established in the Golan Heights, and Israelis would be allowed to visit, without a visa, in daylight hours, the document says.  It says Israel would maintain water rights on the upper Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee.  The two countries would also establish normal diplomatic relations.  The talks and the document they produced resemble the Geneva Initiative of 2003, in which former Israeli and Palestinian government officials, acting on their own, wrote a symbolic political agreement. Neither the Israeli nor the Palestinian government accepted it. Mr. Liel emphasized that he had acted entirely in a private capacity. ''There was no government involvement from the Israeli side,'' he said by telephone.  ",

                    "text": "  New York City's public hospitals and clinics would lose billions of dollars over the next few years under changes President Bush proposes to make to Medicaid -- far more than his plan would cost other parts of the country, according to local and state officials.  Under Medicaid, the health plan for the poor, public hospitals can sometimes collect higher payments than private hospitals do for comparable services. Last week, the Bush administration proposed a regulation that would largely do away with that advantage.  The New York State Department of Health and New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation, the agency that runs the city's public hospital system, estimate that the new rule would cost the corporation $350 million a year, or 7 percent of its annual budget. The cut, officials said, would be felt most in outpatient services, where the system handles five million visits each year.  ''We would have to do a wholesale dismantling of our ambulatory care system and scale down our emergency departments,'' said Alan D. Aviles, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.  Both that rule change and a separate proposal put forward by the president to cover more uninsured people by diverting Medicaid funds have met with serious opposition in Congress. But the administration may be able to make the rule change without Congressional approval.  Last night, in his State of the Union address, President Bush outlined his plan to cover some of the 47 million uninsured people in the United States, through ''affordable choices grants'' to states.  ''These grants would give our nation's governors more money and more flexibility to give private health insurance to those most in need,'' Mr. Bush said.  To help pay for that effort, federal officials said the president's budget would allow states to redirect money out of a Medicaid program, which currently pays billions of dollars to hospitals that care for a disproportionately high share of patients who are uninsured. Most often, these are public hospitals.  States could use the money to cover the uninsured, but it is not clear how much money could be redirected, nor how individual states would respond. Administration officials argue that covering more people will diminish the need for government to compensate hospitals for indigent care. But critics say many poor people would remain uninsured under the president's plan.  Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, a hospital industry group, said, ''You cannot rip away the safety net serving society today on the belief that a vision, a new system, will suddenly appear.''  The proposed changes would hit especially hard at the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the nation's largest state or local health care system, with 11 hospitals and scores of clinics. About 60 percent of its $5 billion annual budget comes from Medicaid -- more than the Medicaid payments to all hospitals combined in some states. About 30 percent of its patients are uninsured.  The Medicaid rule change announced last week is similar to provisions that the Bush administration has proposed in past years' budget talks, which Congress declined to adopt. But a Medicaid regulation can be made without Congressional approval. State and hospital officials say such a policy would probably be challenged in court, and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said that Congress might pass a law to block it.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees the program, estimates that the new rule would save about $760 million a year. But officials say there has been no detailed, state-by-state calculation, so the number could change.  Each state sets the rates its Medicaid program pays hospitals and other providers, and for each dollar spent, it gets matching money from the federal government.  A longstanding Medicaid rule allows state and local governments that own or run hospitals and clinics to receive more money for Medicaid services, beyond what the standard Medicaid rates pay, and draw a federal match on those additional dollars, too. While many public hospitals do not get such supplemental payments from their local government sponsors, New York City contributes hundreds of millions of dollars each year to its hospitals.  In a statement released with the proposed regulation, the administration said that the public hospitals often use the extra payments ''to subsidize health care operations that are unrelated to Medicaid.''  Deborah Bachrach, New York State's Medicaid director, said that using the money to strengthen ''safety net'' hospitals that deliver Medicaid benefits is legitimate, even if some of those benefits go to uninsured patients and others outside Medicaid. And in practice, she said, it is impossible to separate the two. ''It's fine to say Medicaid dollars for Medicaid patients, but in reality it's never that simple,'' she said.  The administration statement also alleged outright cheating of the system. ''We have identified numerous instances in which health care providers did not retain the full amount of their Medicaid payments but were required to refund or return a portion of the payments received'' to the state or local governments, it said. In other words, the supplemental payments made by the state or local governments were a ruse, intended to draw federal matching funds, with the local money eventually being diverted to unrelated uses.  Several lawmakers and hospital industry officials disputed the notion that such abuses are common. Rather, they said, the administration wants to pare services to the poorest of the poor. ''If it was for-profit hospitals in Texas, they wouldn't be doing it,'' Mr. Schumer said.  Nationwide, the supplemental Medicaid payments total more than $3 billion a year, most of it federal money, according to the National Association of Public Hospitals. But the proposed rule would make it much harder to collect that money from Washington, in several ways.  Medicaid imposes an upper limit on its payments to each hospital -- for all services combined, not patient by patient -- and the new rule would lower that cap.  Some public hospitals in New York turn a small profit on Medicaid inpatient services, and absorb a large loss on Medicaid for outpatients, and report an overall Medicaid loss. That would no longer be allowed under the new rule, which would apply caps to inpatient and outpatient care, and would forbid any profit.  ",

                    "text": "  Iran is barring 38 nuclear agency inspectors from entering the country in retaliation for a United Nations resolution aiming to curb Iran's nuclear program, a senior Iranian lawmaker said Monday.  The announcement came only days after Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, Iran's most senior dissident cleric, criticized President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's defiant stance against the West on the nuclear issue in a speech on Friday, calling it provocative. His comments were the first direct public attack on the president's nuclear policy by such a senior cleric.  The two developments suggest an increasingly open debate within Iran over how forcefully to confront the West over Iran's nuclear ambitions, even as its government continues to defend them.  Two hard-line newspapers, including one owned by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have already called for the president to stay out of all nuclear matters. Ayatollah Montazeri said Iran has the right to nuclear technology but questioned the way Mr. Ahmadinejad has confronted the West.  ''One has to deal with the enemy with wisdom,'' he said. ''We should not provoke the enemy, otherwise the country will be faced with problems.  ''We should get our right in a way that it does not create problems or excuses for others,'' he said.  ''Besides, is this our only irrefutable right and we have no other rights?'' he asked, referring to rising inflation since Mr. Ahmadinejad took office over a year ago.  Ayatollah Montazeri was once in line to become Iran's supreme religious leader, until he was banished and put under house arrest for his criticisms. His comments reflect the growing concern in Iran over additional economic sanctions if Iran continues to defy the international demand to halt its uranium enrichment program.  The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 and imposed sanctions banning the trade of goods related to Iran's nuclear program. It also gave Iran a deadline of two months to halt its uranium enrichment program or face tougher sanctions.  In response, Parliament passed a bill last month calling for the government to limit its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  ''The committee has decided to bar 38 inspectors from coming to Iran and we have announced the new limitation to the agency,'' said Alaedin Boroujerdi, the head of Parliament's committee for foreign policy and national security, the ISNA news agency reported.  The nuclear agency's inspectors visit Iran's nuclear facilities regularly. But last summer Iran said that it had decided not to let some of the inspectors return.  Still, Mr. Boroujerdi said that Iran planned to continue its cooperation with the agency, and that Iran would remain a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  An I.A.E.A. spokeswoman, Melissa Flemming, said that the agency was confident that it could continue to monitor Iran's nuclear program.  ''There are a sufficient number of inspectors designated for Iran, and the I.A.E.A. is able to perform its inspection activities in accordance with Iran's Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement,'' she said in an agency statement.  For his part, Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed again on Sunday that Iran would continue with its nuclear program, and brushed off the United Nations resolution as insignificant.  In Brussels on Monday, European Union foreign ministers called for all countries to enforce the sanctions against Iran. The British foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, said a collective application of the sanctions was essential ''to keep pressure on Iran to accept the offer of the international community to come back to the negotiating table.''  European Union officials said they would apply the measures next month, including a ban on selling materials and technology that could be used in Iran's nuclear and missile programs and the freezing of the assets of 10 Iranian companies and individuals.  Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said it was time to take a tough and united stance on Iran but kept the option of diplomacy open. ''There is a need to send a clear signal, and we need to show resolve,'' he said.  Correction:  January 25, 2007, Thursday  A front-page article on Friday about criticism of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, by Iranian religious authorities over his involvement in the country's nuclear program misstated the connection between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and Jomhouri-Eslami, a newspaper that has rebuked Mr. Ahmadinejad. (The error was repeated in an article about Iran on Tuesday.) Ayatollah Khamenei owned the newspaper until 1989, when he became supreme leader and transferred ownership to Massih Mohajeri, a conservative politician. However, the newspaper still reflects Ayatollah Khamenei's views.  ",

                    "text": "  Mos Def  ''True Magic'' (Geffen)  If you happen to get as far as ''Fake Bonanza,'' one of the last few tracks on Mos Def's third solo release, you'll hear this Brooklyn rapper-turned-actor offer his appraisal of modern hip-hop: ''Flossy and raw/so self-absorbed/immature /I can't remember being this bored.''  Fair enough, except that boredom seems to guide this bleary hangover of an album. Mos Def may not be flossy or raw at this stage in his celebrated career, which is fine. But what he offers instead is lukewarm nostalgia and obligatory indignation. Songs like ''Thug Is a Drug,'' ''Crime & Medicine'' and ''Murder of a Teenage Life'' carry urgent messages upfront, but not much depth within. Mos Def may care, and he may deliver tantalizing flashes of lyrical skill, but he doesn't inspire much feeling other than listless dread.  The music may be partly at fault. With production by Preservation, Minnesota and Pharrell, ''True Magic'' often sounds scraped together on the cheap. (The album's laughably bare-bones packaging reinforces this impression.) There are a few soulful moments, like the back-to-back tracks ''There Is a Way'' and ''Sun, Moon, Stars,'' each featuring a blandly appealing singsong exhortation. But it's nowhere near enough.  And Mos Def seems to know it. He ends ''Fake Bonanza'' with a series of halfhearted mumbles that culminate in a defensive-sounding affirmation: ''It makes no difference what people say.'' Then he punctuates that thought with what almost sounds like a yawn.  NATE CHINEN  ",

                    "text": "  Riccardo Muti's streamlined readings of the Russian and German repertory are an acquired taste (though one worth acquiring), and his relatively rare forays into American repertory have been well meaning, if unpersuasive. But there is no one to touch him in Italian music, and that was what he brought to the New York Philharmonic on Thursday evening, the start of his second week of subscription programs with the orchestra at Avery Fisher Hall.  Mr. Muti's message was that there is more to Italian Romanticism than opera -- although he touched on opera as well -- and to that end he devoted the first half of his program to Giuseppe Martucci's enormous Piano Concerto No. 2 in B flat minor (Op. 66), with Gerhard Oppitz as the soloist. Martucci has been scarce in New York: the Philharmonic last performed this concerto in 1911. But Mr. Muti recorded it (along with Martucci's evocative ''Canzone dei Ricordi'') for Sony Classical in 1995, and he has kept it in his repertory, perhaps betting that accidental encounters will win this composer a new audience.  He is on to something. This is a virtuoso concerto (Martucci was, not surprisingly, a pianist), so solidly packed with explosive, daredevil keyboard writing that it isn't until well into the 20-minute first movement that the orchestra has much of substance to offer. When the orchestra does take its stand, its contributions are currents of lyricism or subtle but ear-catching shifts in color, to contrast with the showiness of the piano writing.  Still, it's the piano that rivets the ear, and if you look past the layer of surface bluster you'll find magnificently detailed and at times almost Brahmsian keyboard writing.  Mr. Oppitz was an ideal soloist. He attacked the work with all the vigor it demanded, and played with muscularity, clarity and, in the central Larghetto, a poetic touch. He and Mr. Muti made a powerful case: this concerto may not be the Beethoven ''Emperor,'' but it makes a welcome change from, say, the Tchaikovsky First.  After the intermission, Mr. Muti led a taut account of the ballet music from Verdi's ''Macbeth,'' a fine warm-up for the real business of the second half, Respighi's ''Feste Romane.'' Pictorialism runs deep in Italian music as far back as Monteverdi, and Respighi reveled in it. Here the orchestra evokes everything from the roaring lions at the ancient Circus Maximus, to parades of chanting penitents, to sloppy inebriates, all vividly.  Mr. Muti had the Philharmonic playing at full throttle, with no loss of either tone or precision. This orchestra's brasses, which got a thorough workout, have rarely sounded better.  Riccardo Muti, Gerhard Oppitz and the New York Philharmonic repeat this program tonight at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500.  MUSIC REVIEW  ",

                    "text": "  After campaigning for months on a promise to tighten ethics rules, Senate Democratic leaders tried unsuccessfully Thursday to block a measure that would shine a light on the shadowy practice of earmarking federal money for lawmakers' pet projects.  Last week the House Democrats passed an unexpectedly broad change to their chamber's rules that would disclose the size, purpose and sponsor of any earmark.  But on Thursday, when Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, introduced the same thing in the Senate, Democratic leaders moved quickly to squash it, calling the House bill ill thought out.  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he was happy to see the House ''moving things along very quickly.'' But, Mr. Reid said, ''frankly, I don't think they spent the time on this that we have.''  The Democratic leaders' effort to block the DeMint proposal was defeated by a vote of 51 to 46, surprising almost everyone in the Senate. The outcome reflected the keen desire of many lawmakers to appear to be on the side of openness and reform after an election that turned in part on Congressional corruption scandals.  The reputation of earmarks, which are pet projects individual lawmakers tuck into complicated bills behind the scenes, was tarnished because they figured in several of the scandals. But lawmakers cherished them as a tool of political power used to reward supporters and gain favor with constituents.  On Thursday night, Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said, ''We are continuing to negotiate with Republicans on how to deal with earmark reform.''  Mr. Reid started the week by introducing a bipartisan ethics and lobbying proposal negotiated with the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. It contained a comparatively weak measure on earmarks that would require disclosure of the individual lawmakers sponsoring only a small fraction of them.  The bill excluded all earmarks dispensed through the federal government, including military contracts and civil engineering projects, two of the largest pools of earmarks. It also excluded all earmarks written in the explanatory reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the bills themselves, another broad category.  Mr. Reid offered his own amendment that would ban gifts or trips from lobbyists and the discounted use of corporate jets, but he left the weak earmark provision intact.  Mr. DeMint's amendment to the ethics bill would have eliminated the loopholes and would apparently apply to all earmarks, just as the new House rules do.  After the move to block it failed, Mr. Reid and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, argued vigorously against the measure, saying it could have unintended effects.  ''Earmark disclosure will be a major change in the way the Senate works,'' Mr. Reid said. ''We should adopt the Reid-McConnell version rather than the House version in the DeMint amendment. If we need to revisit the issue later, we can do that.''  Mr. DeMint argued that if the original bill was not strengthened, ''the public's going to know from Day 1 that the idea of being open and transparent is just a scam.''  ",

                    "text": "  A battle between Yonkers and its neighbors over Ridge Hill Village, the $600 million residential, retail and commercial project the city wants to build near its border with the Town of Greenburgh, has gone quiet.  All sides have now settled a lawsuit that accused Yonkers of conducting an inadequate environmental review in its rush to greenlight the project, which will include 1,000 homes, 1.3 million square feet of retail space and who knows how many cars barrelling -- or crawling, as the case may be -- along the roads in and around it, including the Sprain Brook Parkway, the New York State Thruway and Tuckahoe Road.  As settlements go, it doesn't offer much for Yonkers's adversaries. Greenburgh, Hastings-on-Hudson, Ardsley and some residents of Yonkers itself had complained that traffic from Ridge Hill would engulf their streets. They wanted the city and the developer, Forest City Ratner (which is also building The Times's new headquarters in Manhattan), to scale back.  But that didn't happen. About all the settlement calls for is $5 million to mitigate traffic at certain intersections, and the creation of a task force to jointly lobby Westchester County and New York State to ease the traffic problem once and for all by creating a direct link to Ridge Hill from the Sprain Parkway.  Many people can support this solution in theory, but the obstacles to building it are significant. This is partly because the multimillion-dollar system of ramps and exits envisioned by the Yonkers City Council President, Chuck Lesnick, would have to cross a Westchester County park, and the county says it will sacrifice precious parkland to Ridge Hill at about the time hell freezes over.  In addition, the county has already raised serious questions about the scale and design of the so-called village, which it considers a closer cousin of a megamall. It insists further that offering a parkland boon to a private developer would set a catastrophic precedent with other builders and at other parks. The task force can lobby all it wants, the county says, but the Sprain Parkway ramps are roads to nowhere.  We love the idea of a regional task force -- of neighbors joining neighbors, crossing borders and putting heads together to solve development challenges that would otherwise lead to the usual endless and tiresome Westchester border wars.  But in the case of Ridge Hill, where so many problems could have been solved early on, with the City of Yonkers simply listening to its neighbors and working with Forest City Ratner to create a project on a more manageable scale, the great d\u00e9tente appears to have come too late.

Downloads from file-sharing networks are generally free, and have long occurred outside the control of copyright holders. The cost of for-pay downloads, about 90 percent of which go through iTunes, generally includes a licensing fee.  But not many of the freeloaders are actually downloading mainstream content, according to the new data on downloading, which was gathered by the NPD Group, a consumer-research firm, through tracking software installed in 12,500 households. Only about 20 percent of the videos downloaded from file-sharing networks were TV shows, and 5 percent were mainstream movies, while just under 60 percent were pornographic movies.  The relative scarcity of pirated movie downloads may have more to do with legal and business pressure than with users' tastes. Many file-sharing networks are struggling to find accommodation with the movie and recording industries; for example, BitTorrent, a service whose software is on about 80 million computers, struck a deal in 2005 with the Motion Picture Association of America to remove infringing content from the search index on its Web site.

Real enough to make Ford GT (550 horsepower) and Corvette Z06 (500 horsepower) owners deflate into a puddle of power envy.  What's the point? In the small-volume premium sports car market segment, it's all about numbers, and this baby has numbers: 0-to-60 miles an hour in 3.7 seconds; 0-to-100 miles an hour and back to 0 again in just over 12 seconds flat; and 60-to-0 braking in less than 100 feet.  What they said: Between introductions of Juan Pablo Montoya, Elliott Sadler and Kurt Busch, Dodge's star drivers, Chrysler Group's chief operating officer, Eric Ridenour, waxed poetic about the new Viper, quoting the numbers referenced above.  What they didn't say: Dear crosstown rivals: See you on Woodward Avenue. Don't forget to bring your pinks!  What makes it tick? The Chrysler Street & Racing Technology (SRT) group has given the Viper coupe and convertible (which was not shown) a completely new 8.4-liter V-10 engine with variable valve timing and other mechanical tweaks that bump the output to 600 horsepower at 6,100 rpm. It's coupled to an improved, slicker-shifting 6-speed manual transmission.  How much, how soon? The new Viper will go into production late in the spring and arrive at Dodge dealerships by midsummer. Pricing is expected to close in on $90,000 -- the hand-building process can only produce 3,000 Vipers a year running flat-out. Exclusivity has its price.  How's it look? It looks even more menacing and angry than before. The long hood, with a new intake snorkel and six air extractors, will be your best clue that it's the powered-up 2008 version.  ",

But they were faced with counterpoint arguments not only from Democrats but also from other Republicans. ''What I'll be doing is trying to appeal to my Republican colleagues to not pass a nonbinding resolution that basically says to the troops who are going there this is a mission that doesn't have a chance of succeeding,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS.  But on the same program, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said, ''I cannot support sending additional troops to Iraq.''  On ''This Week'' on ABC, Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said the resolutions were ''not helpful'' to the new American commander, Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, or ''to the troops, to the Iraqis.''  On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, a Republican presidential contender, said he was considering voting for a resolution criticizing the plan. That resolution also lays out benchmarks for the Iraqis to achieve and states that the Senate's intention is not to countermand the president's authority as commander in chief.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has passed a more harshly worded resolution criticizing the plan. Its backers include Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.  ",

It serves a dozen kinds of banh mi ($3.25 to $3.50), summer rolls ($3) and some rice and noodle dishes with chicken or pork ($4.25 to $5). The baguettes, which are also sold plain or buttered, are baked on the premises, and the banh mi, especially the somewhat sloppy Vietnamese meatball version, make a satisfying lunch: 113 Mott Street (Canal Street), (212) 226-7221.

                    "text": "  IF you have an ordinary cellphone -- the type that you got free, or cheaply, when you signed up for service -- you might envy those with phones that are also personal digital assistants, like BlackBerrys, Treos, Sidekicks and Windows smartphones.  Those devices, typically costing $200 to $400, let you do more than just make phone calls and take pictures. They are pocket-size computers equipped for many functions, including e-mail, Web browsing and contact management, note taking, financial recordkeeping and a calendar.  But as it turns out, that humble cellphone in your pocket may be able to do all this and more, depending on its built-in features and the available add-on software.  The screen may be a bit smaller than on a palmtop, and you will lack an alphanumeric keyboard, making typing a lot harder -- but as anyone who has sent text messages or entered names into their phone's address book knows, you can peck out letters using the numeric keypad.  Cellphone manufacturers, carriers and independent application providers are now offering lots of programs and services that can be used on a wide number of phones. Not all services work on all phones. Some are carrier-specific, and some work only on certain phones.  Many require that the phone be able to handle programs written in Java (most new ones are). Some services are free; others charge a monthly fee.  There are a variety of ways to get these applications, and you probably already have some. In addition to Bluetooth and a camera, the Nokia 6102i, effectively free after a rebate from Cingular Wireless, comes with software applications including an audio recorder, an alarm clock, a calendar, a to-do list, a note taker, a calculator, a countdown timer and a stopwatch. It also has AOL, Yahoo, ICQ and MSN instant messengers, a text messaging program, an FM radio, e-mail and, of course, an Internet browser.  And all of this is before you download any applications over the wireless network from the Cingular Mall, where you can buy games, ring tones, graphics and other applications.  Sprint's Samsung M500, available for as little as $9.99 after rebate, has a comparable list of built-in features, along with a dictionary and the ability to store files and play music. Like more expensive hand-helds, it comes with a U.S.B. cable to sync with a PC and a 64-megabyte microSD card (for about $30 you can buy a one-gigabyte card) to store MP3 files that you can play on the phone.  It can even display an analog clock, but the real power of this and many other phones is the applications you can buy and download.  Some of the productivity programs that can be downloaded from Sprint are RandMcNally StreetFinder, MapQuest Mobile, Vindigo City Guide, Zagat restaurant guide and FlyteSource Mobile, which gives real-time flight status. These or similar services are also available on phones from other carriers.  All cellular carriers offer some type of e-mail service, sometimes for an extra fee. But consumers have choices. In addition to the carrier's services, there are free third-party services you can use, including Yahoo Mail, Gmail and Flurry.  Before using any of these services or downloading any applications, check to see what, if anything, it will cost. Even if the application is free, there may be data or air-time charges from your carrier, and there may be plans that can reduce those charges.  Flurry, a free service that works with several carriers, is both an e-mail application and an R.S.S. (for Really Simple Syndication) news reader, which you can use to subscribe to frequently updated content. You start by visiting www.flurry.com from your PC and entering your cellphone number, carrier name, e-mail address and password, and any R.S.S. feeds you wish to subscribe to. The service then sends a text message to your phone with a link for downloading the program.  The service works with most publicly available e-mail accounts, the company's chief executive, Sean Byrnes, said. It can also import up to 430 contacts from Outlook, Gmail and any other program or service that can export standard comma separated values, or CSV, files. You can also dial a phone number from that contact list.  Google recently started offering a free cellphone version of its popular Gmail service. If you have signed up for a Gmail account, you can download the application by pointing your cellphone browser to gmail.com/app. You enter your Gmail user name and password, and a few minutes later you are reading your mail. You can also compose and respond to mail and bring up your Gmail contact list.  Yahoo is conducting a public beta test of its free Go 2.0 service, which has numerous applications, including a phone-centric Internet search tool. You tell it where you are (a satellite-based locator will be available later) and it can find nearby restaurants, movie show times, stores and services and display a map to your destination. Because it is a downloaded application (at mobile.yahoo.com), it is faster than using a Web page, but it can also link you to Web pages through your phone's browser.  Yahoo Go also gives you access to Yahoo e-mail synchronized with your Web account. Mail is searchable, and you can display JPEG graphic files. You can track your stock portfolio, follow sports teams and get weather reports. You can also connect to a Flickr photo account to see or share photos from the road. Yahoo Go works with a limited number of phones from Cingular, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, Alltel, Telus and Rogers.  You're not going to find Microsoft Outlook on a run-of-the-mill cellphone. But with SoonR, a free application (at www.soonr.com) that runs in your cellphone's browser, you can use your phone to gain access to data from Outlook and other programs running on a PC or Mac.  You can view thumbnails of Word and Excel files, and Windows users can read, respond, compose and send Outlook e-mail. You can make calls from your Outlook contact list and consult and update Outlook's calendar. The files and programs are not on the phone -- you are using the phone for remote access to your home or office computer, and any changes you make on the phone show up on the PC.  You can remotely use most popular PC and Mac desktop search programs and forward files through your computer's broadband connection. You can even run the Internet phone service Skype on your PC from your cellphone.  Many of today's phones make use of the satellite-based Global Positioning System, mainly to help responders find you in an emergency, but the technology can also be tapped for location-based services, like turning your phone into a portable navigation device with turn-by-turn maps and audible directions through the phone's speaker.  I test-drove both the TeleNav service, which works with select phones from most carriers, and Verizon's VZ Navigator. Both are $10 a month. VZ Navigator can also be bought for $2.99 a day. Both use the phone network to provide directions, maps and points of interest that are updated on an ongoing basis. They have a ''points of interest'' database with millions of listings. TeleNav also has a ''gas by price'' feature that taps into an online database of gas station prices to lead you to the cheapest gas in your area.  So instead of lusting over that palmtop or Apple's highly anticipated iPhone, reach into your pocket and see what that phone of yours has to offer. You might just be carrying around a poor man's BlackBerry -- minus the keyboard.  BASICS  ",

                    "text": "  THE CASTLE IN THE FOREST  By Norman Mailer.  477 pp.  Random House. $27.95  There is a semi-harrowing, careening, self-burlesquing moment that occurs deep in Norman Mailer's ''Armies of the Night,'' his third-person account of taking part in the massive protest against the Vietnam War in Washington in October 1967 -- not only an American masterpiece, but one of the most liberating books ever swirled into being by a human mind. Mailer has succeeded in getting himself arrested, and he's thrown into a police wagon with a young American Nazi.  They stare each other down, exchange threats, stand steaming and streaming together in that quickest form of intimacy known as hatred. The Nazi begins the taunting:  '' 'You Jew bastard,' he shouted. 'Dirty Jew with kinky hair.'  ''They didn't speak that way. It was too corny. Yet he could only answer, 'You filthy Kraut.'  '' 'Dirty Jew.'  '' 'Kraut pig.' ''  Their insults run parallel, their stares converge:  '' 'Come here, you coward,' he said to Mailer, 'I'll kill you.'  '' 'Throw the first punch, baby,' said Mailer, 'you'll get it all.' '' Mailer writes: ''They were both absolutely right. They had a perfect sense of the other.'' Each was ready to brawl. And what if they should? ''In retrospect, it would appear not uncomic -- two philosophical monomaniacs with the same flaw -- they could not help it, they were counterpunchers.'' Then it is back to their inexorable, almost hilarious enmity.  Mailer's power and allure rest in his being, at once, self-surrendering and astringently assertive. Both qualities are present in the encounter with the Nazi. People who have the gift of melting into another nature usually need to assert themselves all the more so as not to melt away altogether. Actors, for example, often self-destruct because they turn their assertiveness inward, against themselves; Mailer, a sometime film performer and director, is fascinated by the actor's craft. His bellicose bravado seems to be a stay against the dissolving of his personality and -- not always successfully -- against self-induced harm.  ''They had a perfect sense of the other.'' Early on, Mailer understood that in a democracy in which the most radically different types of people are thrown together, a harmonious encounter with ''the other'' is an American dream (e.g., the national obsession with the Relationship), the reality of which often becomes an American nightmare (e.g., popular culture's obsession with crime). For the Brooklyn-raised, Jewish, middle-class Mailer, who once wrote about himself that there was ''one personality he found absolutely insupportable -- the nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn'' -- a perfect sense of the more extreme forms of otherness became artistic and intellectual mother's milk.  No surprise, then, that Mailer's previous novel, ''The Gospel According to the Son,'' in which he attempted to inhabit Jesus Christ, felt less like a creative vision than a head-butt against eternity. The material had a built-in obstruction to Mailer's gift of sympathetic self-surrender: Jesus was a nice, middle-class Jewish boy from Nazareth. Now Mailer has returned to the right side, which is to say, the wrong side, of the tracks.  ''The Castle in the Forest'' -- Mailer's first novel in 10 years -- is not just the almost superhumanly detached fulfillment of the somewhat depressed boast he made nearly half a century ago in ''Advertisements for Myself'': ''I wish to attempt an entrance into the mysteries of murder, suicide, incest, orgy, orgasm and Time.'' This remarkable novel about the young Adolf Hitler, his family and their shifting circumstances, is Mailer's most perfect apprehension of the absolutely alien. No wonder it is narrated by a devil. Mailer doesn't inhabit these historical figures so much as possess them.  In ''The Castle in the Forest,'' the devil-narrator -- who is living in the body of an SS man named Dieter -- tells a little tale about the tale he is telling. ''It is more than a memoir and certainly has to be most curious as a biography since it is as privileged as a novel. I do possess the freedom to enter many a mind.'' Those two sentences form the crux of Mailer's originality.  FOR Mailer, a novelist fanatically committed to the truth, the problem of the ego's relation to other people has been for many years now the problem of the narrator's relation to his material. In his eyes, writing must be an authentic presentation of the self.  As Mailer sees it, great writing puts before the reader life's harshest enigmas with clarity and compassion. ''The novelist is out there early with a particular necessity that may become the necessity of us all,'' he has written. ''It is to deal with life as something God did not offer us as eternal and immutable. Rather, it is our human destiny to enlarge what we were given. Perhaps we are meant to clarify a world which is always different in one manner or another from the way we have seen it on the day before.''  And once you have authentically presented yourself in your writing, you can no longer practice the expedience of concealing yourself as a person. So Mailer the man has -- sometimes not happily -- transgressed social norms, just as his books have crashed through the boundaries of alien identity and literary genre. Yet for all the cross-pollination between his art and his life, Mailer has always insisted on true art as a form of honest living. The writer, as he once put it, ''can grow as a person or he can shrink. ... His curiosity, his reaction to life must not diminish. The fatal thing is to shrink, to be interested in less, sympathetic to less, desiccating to the point where life itself loses its flavor, and one's passion for human understanding changes to weariness and distaste.''  Mailer has never, like the dandy, tried to live aesthetically. When he stabbed his wife at a party in 1960 and when he helped get released from prison a literarily gifted killer who then stabbed an aspiring young playwright to death, it was because he followed the wrong impulses, not the wrong ideas. He never committed the ugliness of insinuating that he screwed up for art's sake. He let the ugliness and the imprudence of his actions speak for themselves.  Mailer did heedlessly write -- in the notorious essay ''The White Negro'' (published in the democratic-socialist journal Dissent, a most decent, un-notorious little magazine) -- that the hypothetical murder of a middle-aged shopkeeper by two hoodlums was an example of ''daring the unknown,'' of ''trying to create a new nervous system,'' of ''looking for the opportunity to grow up a second time.'' It is widely assumed that Mailer was trying to shock the bourgeoisie with a sympathy for violence. But if you read the essay all the way through, you see that he was doing something else: trying to shock the respectable class with an imaginative inhabitation of the violent. Rather than advocating murder, Mailer was exercising his perfect sense of the other -- in this instance, ''the psychopathic personality'' that, he theorized, ''may indeed be the perverted and dangerous front-runner of a new kind of personality, which could become the central expression of human nature before the 20th century is over.'' Such wild empathy is an insult to the everyday solipsism of ''decent'' self-interest that sees evil and shrugs. Anyway, how many writers would dare to sacrifice the appearance of sanity for the sake of absolute emotional and intellectual transparency?  A truthful modern writer who possesses the shamanistic ''freedom to enter many a mind'' might choose to answer the hyperskeptical, Freudian-influenced modern reader's question: ''So who is doing the entering?'' In other words, what is the nature of this particular writer's authority? The postmodernists answer the question by installing layers of artistic self-consciousness inside the work itself. For decades, Mailer has been answering it existentially. ''We perceive the truth of a novel by way of the personality of the writer,'' he wrote in the introduction to ''The Time of Our Time,'' a selection of his work published in 1998. ''That is the flavor of fiction. We observe the observer.''  So, to allow readers to observe the observer, Mailer writes a novel followed by a nonfiction book that illuminates his state of mind behind the preceding novel; composes essays outlining obsessions that shape his fictions; makes a literal rendering, animated by the novelist's special clairvoyance, of a real event that Mailer himself lived through and acted in -- he swings (''for to swing is to communicate, is to convey the rhythms of one's own being to a lover, a friend or an audience'') from reports on boxing, Marilyn Monroe, the moon landing and John F. Kennedy, to polemics against feminism and scientific technology, to reflections on totalitarianism from the right and the left, to fiction about socialism, McCarthyism, Hollywood, high society, Lee Harvey Oswald, ancient Egypt and the C.I.A. Mailer's ambition to ''turn the consciousness of our time,'' as he once put it, drove the symbolic combustions of private and public life in his early novels ''Barbary Shore'' and ''The Deer Park.'' It's what incited him to run for mayor of New York in 1969.  This restless vastness of Mailer's ambition (''In motion a man has a chance'') is such that his ''failures'' are seminal, his professional setbacks groundbreaking. His willingness to fail -- hugely, magnificently, life-affirmingly -- expands artistic possibilities. Then, too, point to any contemporary literary trend -- the collapse of the novel into memoir; the fictional treatment of actual events; the blurred boundaries of ''history as a novel, the novel as history'' (the subtitle of ''The Armies of the Night'') -- and there is Mailer, pioneering, perfecting or pulling apart the form.  In fact, he has lived and written so impulsively that his life and his writing each need the other to be completed. That itself conveys a brutal honesty about the limitations of life, and of writing. Or as Mailer once wonderfully and bizarrely complained: ''It is not demanding to write about characters considerably more defeated than oneself since the writer's ego is rarely in danger of being punished by too much self-perception.'' In politics, this is called ''accountability.'' Mailer's emotional and psychological transparency make his work a kind of ersatz democracy.  One way to take the measure of a writer is by considering the weight, quality and consistency of his obsessions. Mailer, from the beginning, has had a rage for what he calls ''nakedness.'' It is a passion for emptying his psyche onto the table in front of the reader, much as a person who has just been arrested will be ordered by the police to empty his pockets as he is being booked.  Indeed, Mailer loves freedom so ambitiously that he is never free of the feeling of not being free. Here is Mailer in ''The Deer Park,'' a Hollywood tale so caustic and seemingly unmediated by art that reading it is, in places, like listening to Maria Callas become all the more vivid as Aida by vulnerably failing to hit her high notes: ''The unspoken purpose of freedom was to find love, yet when love was found one could only desire freedom again.'' Of the sudden fame and fortune that came to him with the publication of his first book at the age of 25, Mailer wryly recalled: ''My farewell to an average man's experience was too abrupt; never again would I know, in the dreary way one usually knows such things, what it was like to work at a dull job or take orders from a man one hated.'' His feeling that early success cut him off from vital, common experience may explain why he has kept diving so purposefully, and extremely, back into experience.  The inaugural book was ''The Naked and the Dead,'' and it was the first instance of Mailer's obsession with being ''naked'' in public.  Mailer originally used the title for a play based on his brief employment in a mental institution during his college years at Harvard. He chose it again for his epic tale about World War II, inspired by his service as a rifleman, among other duties, in the South Pacific. Nakedness in this novel means the dehumanizing process by which war's atmosphere of death strips soldiers down to their bare, defenseless essence as mortal beings. In war, men are returned to their original state; they are reborn helplessly into the world. Inter faeces et urinam.  But as his career evolved, Mailer began to invest the word with a contrary import. Nakedness came to mean the way Mailer the man and the writer bared his impulses, desires, instincts and thoughts -- mortality as a cry of defiance against mortality. Nakedness in public, saying the unsayable, becomes a form of power.  Mailer's divulgences involve writing about his envy, bitterness, selfishness and greed, about the effect of the slings and arrows rained down on his own lustful, fearful, grasping, always faltering, always charging ego. In ''Advertisements for Myself,'' Mailer rued the critic-inflicted wounds that resulted in ''three or four years of constipated work, lack of confidence, cowardly sweetness and bouts of churlishness''; took vicious measure of rivals like Bellow (''I cannot take him seriously as a major novelist''), Styron, Salinger and Baldwin, among others; and reprinted the belligerent inscription he'd written on a copy of ''The Deer Park'' that he sent Hemingway. Papa's failure to acknowledge it ''helped to push me further and deeper into the next half year of bold assertions, half-done work, unbalanced heroics and an odd notoriety of my own choice.'' Has any consequential American writer scoured himself so thoroughly and alarmingly in public? Mailer writes like a Puritan without a superego.  To Mailer's mind, such self-exposure earned him the entitlement to write about other people's envy, bitterness, selfishness and greed. This is how he addressed his Greenwich Village readers in 1956, in the first column he wrote for The Village Voice, which he had recently co-founded: ''That many of you are frustrated in your ambitions, and undernourished in your pleasures, only makes you more venomous. ... Nevertheless, given your general animus to those more talented than yourselves, the only way I see myself becoming one of the cherished traditions of the Village is to be actively disliked each week.'' He was probably right; still, that was one short-lived column. The assaults of his reviewers also justified Mailer's own ferocity in criticism. In his antifeminist tirade, ''The Prisoner of Sex,'' he lashes Kate Millet: ''The yaws of her distortion were nicely hidden by the smudge pots of her indignation.''  Baring your private demons in order to expose other people's -- including your rivals' -- has been for Mailer a type of anti-macho courage. He set out to map the dark underside of the American ego just as Hemingway had anatomized American nerve. In a country openly driven by self-interest and self-absorption, the ego's hidden bruises and connivings are too fundamental to be openly discussed.  Reflecting in the 1950s on his ''fear of homosexuality,'' Mailer wrote that ''I could kill this inhibition only by jumping into the middle of the problem without any clothes.'' That is, only by confessing his aversion and apologizing for it in print, which he did, bravely, in ''Advertisements for Myself.'' Nakedness again. Throughout his career, Mailer has eccentrically, 19th-centurily, associated any self-repression with death by cancer. (When Susan Sontag protested figurative interpretations of physical disease in ''Illness as Metaphor,'' she was, to a large extent, responding to Mailer.) Mailer is one of the last Western writers to create a self-contained intellectual universe out of strong, idiosyncratic convictions about the relationship between spiritual, psychic and social existence. In his autonomous creative world, heterosexual anal sex is the power-replenishing and very good (for the man) alternative to banal sex; masturbation is power-depleting and very bad; homosexuality is regrettable, but dignified; condoms are dreadful (a conclusion reached in the era before AIDS); and unprotected sexual intercourse between a man and a woman is What It Is All About. And that's just sex. According to Mailer, technology makes us strut like puffed-up little gods and sucks the air out of intellect and will.  Ours is an age of mockery and sarcasm, when even irony is belittled for being secretly sincere about its lack of conviction. People wring their hands over the Fate of the Novel, but no one seems comfortable with a novelistic approach -- i.e., a universalizing intuition expanding through a fresh perception -- in nonfiction. Mailer's theories are the hyperorganizing overflow of a novelist's mind, which by its nature leaps back and forth between intuition and experience. As he puts it, there is little he has written, ''even when it comes under the formal category of nonfiction or argument, that has not derived, then, from my understanding of how one writes fiction.'' And so, ''fiction, as I use the word, is a reality that does not cohere to received axes of fact but is breathed in through the swarm of our male and female movements about one another.''  To not cohere to received axes of fact -- magical phrase! -- to approach life novelistically, is to make connections between the visible and the invisible world, and to transfigure the commonplace. We now are drowning in mind-numbing literature of the commonplace: tipping points, hive minds, ''freakonomics,'' ''bobos in paradise'' -- it is all lifestyle trends, marketing techniques, cheap behavioral psychology and glib social-pattern-spotting. This flood of minutiae makes one long for Mailer's heroic attempts to invest experience with a higher meaning, no matter how far-out or unacceptable some of his connections between seen and unseen might be. Even if such notions offend household pieties, they have the effect of making you return fully awake to first principles that had begun to make you snore. And when Mailer's connections work, they are beyond good.  In his book about Marilyn Monroe, he wrote, ''Since sex is, after all, the most special form of human communication, and the technological society is built on expanding communication in much the way capitalism was built on the expansive properties of capital and money, the perspective is toward greater promiscuity.'' If you are seeking an explanation for why pornography takes up most of the Internet, there it is.  At the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Mailer observed that some of Mayor Richard Daley's ''Illinois goons'' had ''eyes like drills; others, noses like plows; jaws like amputated knees.'' Reporting on the Republican convention in Miami, in that same year, Mailer observed that Nelson Rockefeller ''had only one flaw -- an odd and unpleasant mouth, a catfish mouth, wide, unnaturally wide with very thin lips. In the center of the mouth there seemed almost another mouth which did the speaking.'' In all of these transfiguring passages, Mailer bores into familiar particulars and comes out on the other side with a poetic singularity.  This capacity to draw out new meaning from personalities and events may explain why Mailer is the only major American novelist to be really canny about politics. The subject worked Bellow up into sulfurous apocalyptics; it turns Updike coy and indifferent; it transforms savage, uncontainable Roth into a good old-fashioned Upper West Side liberal. But Mailer's wild empathy endows his vintage political writing with a wild, visceral prescience.  He understands, for example, that consummate insiders are often temperamental outsiders -- outlaws in the good or bad sense of the word. Here he is on John Erlichmann's testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee in July 1973, in which an outsider's character and dignity suddenly upended the insider's sordid malfeasance: ''He acted as if he were proud to be on the side he was on; his pride was what could not be suffered. For it spoke of a world whose real complexity could savage a liberal brain. Liberals could certainly live with the hot idea that they were fighting Mephisto's own Nixon, but they couldn't support the Kierkegaardian complexity that the good guys might be right next to the bad guys on the same team.'' A lesser writer would treat the insider/outsider paradox as merely a lesson in hypocrisy. For Mailer it is further proof that the world ''is always different in one manner or another from the way we have seen it on the day before.'' His grasp of power's myriad facets gives some of his political predictions a visionary accuracy.  Almost 40 years ago, in ''The Armies of the Night,'' Mailer characterized himself as a ''left conservative,'' thus envisioning a syncretic position that is now the holy grail of the best ideological aspiration. At the 1968 Republican convention, gazing at the legions of conservatives around him, Mailer realized that their faith ''existed in those crossroads between the psyche and the heart where love, hate, the cognition of grace, the all but lost sense of the root, and adoration of America congregate for some.'' He was the first serious liberal to take conservatives seriously -- that is to say, novelistically. At his best (his post-9/11 politics have taken a turn into a kind of forced occultism), he writes about America as though he were an expatriate living in a Beautiful Idea of America, from which exile he notates the shadowy degrees between ideal and real.  No political foresight of Mailer's can surpass the prediction he made in 1962, at the height of the cold war, in a debate with William F. Buckley Jr.: ''So let the true war begin. It is not a war between West and East, between capitalism and Communism, or democracy and totalitarianism; it is rather the deep war which has gone on for six centuries in the nature of Western man, it is the war between the conservative and the rebel, between authority and instinct.'' It was, he went on, ''the war we can expect if the cold war will end. It is the war that will take life and power from the center and give it over to left and to right, it is the war that will teach us our meaning.'' And he said this before the cultural conflagrations ignited by the '60s, which burn deeper and wider now.  One quality separates Mailer from many of his heavy-hitting contemporaries. He went to war. The Army revealed to Mailer the variety and breadth of American society. But war made him a storyteller who has a deep mistrust of narrative.  The sprawl and chaos of battle are not unlike the sprawl and chaos of a human life -- or on a larger scale, democracy itself. In ''The Naked and the Dead,'' Mailer wrote a classic narrative. But then, as though the war had gradually seeped through his nerves into his imagination, Mailer's novels slowly moved away from conventional plots and story lines. The stunningly compressed social-sexual symmetries of ''Barbary Shore,'' ''The Deer Park'' and ''An American Dream'' burst into the form-exploding streams of consciousness in ''Why Are We in Vietnam?'' and then were stretched into long, messy, fictionalized actual lives and events in the controlled chaos and sprawl of ''The Executioner's Song,'' ''Ancient Evenings'' (a flawed tour-de-force of alien inhabitation) and ''Harlot's Ghost.''  The greatest of these is ''The Executioner's Song,'' which tells the true story of Gary Gilmore, a man doomed to violence who spent half his life in jail and, upon his release, murdered two men in cold blood. Sentenced to death row, Gilmore could have staved off execution indefinitely by legal means, but instead tried to kill himself several times, defied his lawyers' attempts to appeal and finally insisted on being put to death by firing squad. The uncanny dynamic driving the book gradually shifts from portraying Gilmore as a violent mythomaniac at war with society, to depicting a ruthlessly mythologizing media at war with Gilmore's ragged soul, as Gilmore himself works the levers of mass spectacle. Once back in jail, the consummate outsider discovers he has an insider's temperament -- inside prison, having become a media sensation, he discovers the quiddity of America's madness.  With its breathtaking panorama sweeping from the country's small-time depths to its big-time shallows, ''The Executioner's Song'' was like ''The Naked and the Dead'' stateside -- or, given Mailer's heightened powers at the midpoint of his career, ''War and Peace'' translated into the Great American Novel. The book's sprawl made it the anti-''In Cold Blood'': where Capote pressed his real-life tale into a neat narrative, Mailer let his naturally respire through the billion pores of its accumulated, enveloping facts. The language is flat, smooth, shaved down, as if Mailer had produced his words by running a carpenter's plane over reality. It is the fulfillment of Hemingway's style: it has the same spare, unforgiving, unflinching neutrality, but without Hemingway's deliberate literary manner. In an inspired stroke, Mailer separates his paragraphs with a double space, making them the typographical equivalent of Gilmore's Utah County, where ''the desert was at the end of every street.'' The technique also lets him capture how American experience seems to consist of disconnected moments, each one possessing an isolated magnitude, as though you were advancing minute by minute into the future out of no past, from one eternal present to another.  In ''The Executioner's Song,'' Mailer at last found the right relationship of the narrator to his material. He completely effaces his personality, but because the environment he recreates brims with his much publicized themes and obsessions -- sex, violence, power, repression, displacement; all in the pursuit of happiness -- the story itself becomes an actor in Mailer's pre-existing universe. The novel is free of his presence and full of his presence, overtly self-surrendering and subtly self-assertive, written not in the first- or third- but in a kind of spectral fourth-person. Mailer the author becomes as simultaneously real and unreal as Gilmore -- as America itself.  For all that, the bounty of ''The Executioner's Song'' is its compassion: neither sentimental nor judgmental; large-hearted in its poise and reserve. The book has no marginal or ''flat'' characters. Each figure possesses the roundness of his or her real life. Perhaps that's why so many sentences in ''The Executioner's Song'' begin with a proper name or pronoun. The overflowing force of Mailer's egotism endows him with respect for the power and capacity of other people's egos. But his rarest and most precious quality is that he is able to see the most alien people in the familiar way they see themselves. Which brings us to Mailer's new novel.  Toward the end of ''The Castle in the Forest,'' Dieter, the novel's devil-narrator, imagines a question from the reader: ''Dieter, where is the link to your text? There is a lot of forest in your story but where is the castle?''  Dieter replies that in German ''The Castle in the Forest'' is das Waldschloss, a name, he says, that some Jews gave to the particular concentration camp in which they were imprisoned. In fact, Dieter explains, ''Waldschloss sits on the empty plain of what was once a potato field. Not many trees are in sight, nor any hint of a castle. Nothing of interest is on the horizon. Waldschloss became, therefore, the appellation given by the brightest of the prisoners to their compound. One pride maintained to the end was that they must not surrender their sense of irony. That had become their fortitude. It should come as no surprise that the prisoners who came up with this piece of nomenclature were from Berlin.''  Dieter's weird and unique riff on the nature of German irony follows, and for the sake of understanding this richly enigmatic book it has to be quoted in full: ''German came to us originally as the language of simple folk, good pagan brutes and husbandmen, tribal people, ready for the hunt and the field. So it is a language full of the growls of the stomach and the wind in the bowels of hearty existence, the bellows of the lungs, the hiss of the windpipe, the cries of command that one issues to domesticated animals, even the roar that stirs in the throat at the sight of blood. Given, however, the imposition laid on this folk through the centuries -- that they be ready to enter the amenities of Western civilization before the opportunity passes away from them altogether -- I do not find it surprising that many of the German bourgeoisie who had migrated into city life from muddy barnyards did their best to speak in voices as soft as the silk of a sleeve. Particularly, the ladies.'' He adds: ''To every sharp German fellow, however, particularly the Berliners, irony had to become the essential corrective.''  The Castle in the Forest'' is a story about simple folk and good pagan brutes from the muddy barnyard, a tale narrated by a devil whose voice is soft as the silk of a sleeve, and written in the spirit of a corrective irony. The young Adolf Hitler, his parents, siblings, stepsiblings and extended family are stuck in the sty of their instincts, immediate gratifications, primitive fears and terrors, yet nearly each of them -- the men, especially -- feels that he is living a noble, honorable, admirable life.  Mailer the wild empathizer, the maestro of the human ego, is keen and blunt about these delusions -- what, in effect, are the deceptively homey psychological origins of evil. At one point the devil says: ''We are keyed to look for excess of every kind,'' and ''every exaggeration of honest sentiment is there to serve our aims.'' Elsewhere he notes: ''People had to be wary of feeling too saintly, since they could not be certain of the source of such feelings. They could be working for Satan.'' And also: ''Rare was the man or woman who did not possess an intense sense of the injustice done to them each day. It was our taproot to every adult. It was a fury in every child.'' The ''ability to wall up the most unpalatable facts about oneself will always elicit my unwilling admiration.''  These walled-in sentiments produce in the Hitlers (their name passed through various changes) the delusion that their conscience inhabits a castle, when in fact, they are so subject to the primal ooze of their feelings that they resemble trees fixed in nature's irresistible forces. ''The Castle in the Forest'' is an intricately constructed novel, and one of its recurrent motifs is the explicit comparison of people to trees. The devil finds the ''taproot'' to his clients. After (unforgettably described) sex with Adolf's future father, Alois Schicklgruber, Hitler's future mother, Klara Poelzl, experiences a guilt that is ''as heavy as a waterlogged tree.'' Another character is ''bent by now as a tree that has faced too much wind for too many years.'' At one point, Mailer potently describes woods in which there were ''not too many tortured shapes to suggest the aftermath of crazy storms when the trees were young.'' In a travesty of nature and procreation, the young Adolf Hitler likes to masturbate on leaves.  Somewhere along the line, Dieter remarks on ''that curious human nature, which forces its way into existence between the hazards of urine and excrement, yet will later dream each night of a noble life.'' Inter faeces et urinam, another of this novel's themes, is a further twist on ''nakedness'' and on mortal helplessness. These tree-people remain stuck infantlike in the waste amid which they were born -- Alois, the pathologically womanizing customs official; Klara, his wife and niece, who hides in the folds of escapist religious piety her instinctive knowledge that she is in fact Alois's daughter; Adolf, whose onanistic sessions are like ''being shot out of his own cannon.'' They are all -- spiritually, emotionally and mentally -- as naked as the day they came into the world. In the case of Adolf, he will defensively transmute his naked helplessness into a perverted egotism: the terrible power that he will wreak on other human beings.  Mailer is pretty faithful to the outlines of Hitler's life, though for some reason he makes Adolf's sister Paula retarded, when in reality she was not. (Nor was there ever a concentration camp referred to as Waldschloss.) Mailer does take two considerable liberties. He gives Hitler only one testicle, and makes him the product of father-daughter incest. Rumors of both began circulating after Hitler's suicide in 1945; Mailer makes actual what no one can prove or disprove. The incest is essential to Mailer's purpose. Ever since Wagner celebrated the brother-sister coupling of Siegmund and Sieglinde in ''Die Walk\u00fcre'' -- a superlove greater than piddly human morality, etc. -- some Nazis had thrilled to the idea of hatching the master race in the family rec room, a disagreeable impulse they then projected outward onto their image of depraved, incestuous Jews.  For Mailer, incest represents the sick inversion of everything he cherishes: expansion of the self beyond one's origins; the gift of empathy with the other; the ability to sublimate love into work and vice versa. Even the Hitler family's most strenuous attempt at the last backfires. Alois's passion to redeem his life with work as a beekeeper turns disastrously into a warped lesson in crushing utilitarianism and social control -- a lesson not lost on young ''Adi.'' Nature itself, unresisted by an enlightened human will, backfires. The real ''castle'' is the repulsive parody of a castle: the squalid hut of a master beekeeper called Der Alte, a sadist and child molester who is the most consequential of Adolf's twisted mentors.  Insofar as the forest represents natural goodness (Mailer beautifully has the devil suggest that ''even processed paper still contains an ineluctable hint of the tenderness God put into his trees'' ), ''forest'' and ''castle'' are, you might say, the two poles of Mailer's work and life. The popular conception of Mailer sees only the former: unrestrained expression of impulses and instincts; sex as freedom; absolute candor as ineluctable hint of God's presence. But Mailer is also an immensely disciplined craftsman and stylist who has spent the larger portion of his life working at the writer's trade. He is a castle builder expert in the different paths along which people can wander and become lost in a forest without a castle, and yet trick themselves into thinking that they inhabit a resplendent fortress or chateau. Perhaps in some subtle way, he wants in this late novel to make clear the difference between tortured, and mostly sublimated, obsession with sex and violence -- a nice Jewish boy's boxing match with repression -- and the compulsive sex and violence that are the true mark of a repressed nature.  Over the gates to Auschwitz hung a sign that said, with inhuman irony, ''Arbeit Macht Frei.'' Work makes you free. By titling his castle-less book ''The Castle in the Forest,'' Mailer has created, with infinitely human irony, the inner story of the deluded minds that, inadvertently and not, laid the road that led to Auschwitz. Some critics may exaggerate Mailer's occasional easy moral equivalences, and his handful of dog-eared, though hardly invalid, allusions to the diabolical nature of art. They may also mistake the presence of his hallmark obsessions for narcissistic anachronism -- in which case they will not only fail to enjoy the devil's fabulous cadenza on bad odors and the nature of evil, but be blind to the role of sexuality in human history. They will also miss the profound moral engagement of this book. Mailer has imagined himself into a raw propinquity to evil without losing either his nerve or his humanity. He uses his sense of the other to inhabit people devoid (except for the otherworldly Dieter) of his other-apprehending gift.  There is no weary celebration of the demonic here, no facile declaration of evil's universal latency. Mailer, who believes in God and the Devil the way Greeks and Romans believed in meddling supernatural rivals, has never had sympathy for the Devil, and he has none here. ''Our aim, after all,'' Dieter says of Satan's purposes, ''was to keep reducing human possibilities.'' Far from being a smooth minion of dapper Mephistopheles, Dieter is, for one thing, an awful storyteller. To readers unwilling to have the novel interrupted by Dieter's account of his assignment to the coronation of Nicholas II in Russia -- Mailer's Tolstoyan reimagination of that time and event -- Dieter says sloppily: ''Just turn to Page 261. Adolf Hitler's story will pick up again right there.'' Mailer has contempt for this devil, surpassed only by his loathing for young Adolf. Yet Mailer is also in awe of the devil's multifarious nature. Dieter coquettishly insinuates that he wishes to betray Satan and go over to the side of the ''Dummkopf,'' a name Satan insists his legions call God so as to conjure a derisive image of a being who has a great, magnetic claim on their respect. (Mailer would be a fearsome adversary in the arena of office politics.) It is Dieter's very complexity -- ''real complexity could savage a liberal brain'' -- that inflames Mailer and which he thus conscientiously evokes. Dieter says, ''Yet is it not also true that one cannot find a devil who will not work both sides of the street?'' The use of a triple negative to express evil's protean and malleable nature, with its echo of Christ being thrice denied, is itself a multifarious malediction on evil, rising into art from the heave and toss of Mailer's temperament. Alone among American writers, Mailer has earned the right to use a triple negative. So let it be said, once and for all: Norman Mailer is a rebellious angel who never fell. Whoever told him that he has fallen, got it; in the words of the younger Mailer to that other type of Nazi, they got it all. They are getting it again, in this utterly strange work of naked, wild empathy.  ",

The letdowns, 1-point defeats to the Sacramento Kings on Monday night and the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, came on the heels of a four-game winning streak that had the Nets at .500 for the first time in two months. They have followed each apparent turning point this season with a misstep.  With their season past the midway point, the Nets (20-22) were still trying for their first road victory against a Western Conference opponent when they played the Los Angeles Clippers (20-21) on Thursday night.  After the game against the Warriors, ''the mood was not good,'' Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said Thursday morning. ''If you're a competitor, as a player or as a coach, you're very upset about that, about losing two games like that, games that you had in hand.''  Perhaps most disheartening for the Nets is that their five-game trip was getting more difficult. They play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night and the Utah Jazz on Monday.  ''Virtually every game, we're playing a better team,'' Thorn said. ''We've got our work cut out for us.''  Against the Kings, the Nets held a 20-point lead in the third quarter, only to have it evaporate at the hands of Sacramento point guard Mike Bibby, who capped a strong fourth quarter by making the winning shot with 10 seconds remaining.  ''We just quit playing,'' Thorn said. ''We just stood around in the fourth quarter.''  The Nets led the Warriors by 11 points with a little more than four minutes remaining, but Golden State finished the game on a 17-5 run, capped by guard Monta Ellis hitting the winner at the buzzer. It was the seventh time this season the Nets had lost after squandering a double-digit lead.  ''It is hard,'' Nets forward Bostjan Nachbar said after the game. ''It is not easy. We had both games won. We thought we were the better team, at least most of the game. We lost the game down the stretch, and the next couple games will show how tough we are.''  The Nets' grit will have to start with their two stars, Jason Kidd and Vince Carter. That is especially true with their third top-flight player, Richard Jefferson, out for about six weeks after he had arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle Monday.  Kidd has been stellar all season, playing some of the best basketball of his career, but he had eight turnovers against the Warriors.  Carter, after leading by 214,000 votes the last time they were counted, was surpassed in the All-Star voting by the Washington Wizards' Gilbert Arenas for an Eastern Conference starting spot Thursday. Arenas beat out Carter by 3,010 votes, the smallest margin in 17 years. Carter has been voted a starter six times.  Before Thursday night's game, Carter pretended to have thought he had beaten out Arenas. After sarcastically acting as if his feelings were hurt, Carter said he would not be disappointed to go the game as a reserve.  ''It's still an honor to be involved in it,'' he said.  For now, Carter has more pressing things to think about. He scored only 8 points against the Kings. Despite having 23 points and a career-high 13 assists against the Warriors, he did not dominate down the stretch.  The injuries to Jefferson and center Nenad Krstic, who is out for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, have probably affected Carter more than any other player because he faces more double-teams.  As the Nets have struggled this season, Carter has seemed to be the most likely candidate for a trade if Thorn chooses to make drastic changes. Carter can opt out of his contract at the end of the season, meaning the Nets may try to get someone in return for him if they feel he may leave.  But with the Nets' recent success -- they had won 9 of 11 games before losing to the Kings and the Warriors -- much of the trade talk seemed to have settled.  The Nets' ability to make any significant trades by the Feb. 22 deadline could be hampered by the fact that two of their biggest assets, Jefferson and Krstic, are injured.  ''When you're talking about trading, you trade from assets,'' Thorn said. ''If you don't have a lot of assets to trade, it's difficult to make anything but a minor trade.''  BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  The Misunderstood Jew  The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus  By Amy-Jill Levine  250 pages. HarperSanFrancisco. $24.95.  As a child Amy-Jill Levine insisted on attending catechism class at a Catholic church. She faithfully administered Holy Communion to her Barbie doll. This, despite being, then as now, an observant Jew. A professor of New Testament studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School, Ms. Levine has spent a lifetime exploring the profound connections and equally profound divisions between Christianity and Judaism -- and, perhaps more important, between Christians and Jews.  The premise of ''The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus'' is simple: Jews and Christians need to understand one another. The implicit corollary: Despite years of trying, and to their mutual harm, they do not.  In a book intended for Jews and Christians alike (but mostly addressed to Christians) Ms. Levine offers both critique and corrective on topics as seemingly disparate as the Jewish content of the Lord's Prayer and Christian responses to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But that is Ms. Levine's point: to show how frequently and disastrously inaccurate beliefs about Jesus and early Judaism produce distorted relationships in the present.  Her first chapters, devoted to the Jewish Jesus and the New Testament, are the least satisfying. In the interests of educating her reader about Judaism in both the first century and the 21st, she moves somewhat erratically between the two eras.  A discussion of Jesus' views on the Sabbath begins with a modern Jewish view of the Sabbath before considering the roots of this view in the Torah, and she discusses how the Christian celebration of Sabbath on Sunday rather than Saturday changes its symbolic import, before returning to Jesus and his first-century context. The information is valuable but might be more edifying, especially for the nonspecialists who form the book's primary audience, if the shifting time frame were less distracting.  Ms. Levine's reconstructions of first-century Judaism are corrective in some places but elsewhere simply repeat unhelpful truisms. For example, she uncritically takes rabbinic writings as representing the ''majority'' view among first-century Jews, despite growing scholarly rejection of this stance. Similarly, Paul's belief that Jesus' blood atoned for human sin is described as unprecedented and ''off-putting'' for Jews. Certainly, blood atonement is off-putting for most modern Jews, but in some ancient Jewish contexts it was standard fare, as evidenced by repeated claims in 2 and 4 Maccabees that the blood of Jewish martyrs atoned for the sins of the people.  Ms. Levine's perpetuation of some anachronistic readings, however, confirms her larger point: Our received assumptions about what Jesus (and Paul) meant in their original settings are deeply entrenched, often serving agendas of which we are not even aware. She is on a surer footing when she addresses the question of anti-Judaism within the New Testament. Three extremely painful texts -- 1 Thessalonians 2:14-15, with its claim that the Jews killed Jesus; Matthew 27:25, in which the Jews call for Jesus' blood upon themselves and their children; and John 8:44, in which Jesus labels the Jews ''children of the Devil'' -- suffice to demonstrate that regardless of authorial intent or historical context, the plain meaning of the New Testament is often virulently anti-Jewish.  In such instances historical context becomes irrelevant; the problem will not be solved by more or better scholarship. Rather, the problem can be addressed only by those who read these texts as Scripture: ''Christians must denounce anti-Jewish readings.'' What Ms. Levine finds, however, is that even theologically educated and well-meaning Christians frequently don't denounce such readings, but instead either deny their anti-Jewish content (here the Pontifical Biblical Commission comes in for special criticism) or, often unwittingly, replicate it.  Ms. Levine's documentation of the insouciance with which liberal Christians slander Jews and Judaism is perhaps the book's most important contribution. She cites numerous examples of contemporary scholars, particularly theologians of liberation, who first ''invent a bad Judaism'' and then ''explain how Jesus abrogates this bad system.'' In her most outrageous example, Jesus' crucifixion is said to mark the ''triumph of the patriarchal god of Judaism.''  Many of the works Ms. Levine cites were published by the World Council of Churches, a group committed to overcoming anti-Semitism. How can well-meaning Christians perpetuate such theological abomination? Mostly, argues Ms. Levine, through sloppy scholarship and lazy reading.  Christian seminarians are taught little about Judaism, either ancient or modern (Judaism does not count as a ''different'' tradition in many programs that require study of a non-Christian tradition), and so look to the only ''Jews'' available -- the Israelites of the Old Testament -- for a model of what Jews do and believe. First-century Jews are seen either as figures transplanted from the Old Testament or as practitioners of a ''late Judaism'' that has corrupted Old Testament ideals. Modern Jews, in turn, embody the already-fossilized religion practiced by Jesus' first-century enemies.  Within this limited horizon Jesus can only be defined against the Judaism of his day rather than within it. Hence Ms. Levine's concern ''to see Jesus as a Jew who made sense to other Jews in a Jewish context,'' ultimately allowing him to become ''a bridge,'' spanning the gap between modern Jews and Christians.  Jewish-Christian dialogue, having come into its own in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has seemed less compelling in recent decades. Ms. Levine's chilling tales of casual anti-Judaism among scholars who should know better rekindles the urgency of the task. She covers a vast canvas and of necessity does so in broad strokes, some more effective than others. But it is a book whose strengths far outweigh its flaws, and whose flaws count only because its subject matters so deeply.

                    "text": "  Toyota is putting its reputation as a premium automaker to a test by pricing its redesigned pickup, the Tundra, several thousand dollars higher than comparable trucks made by General Motors and Ford.  Sticker prices for the bigger and brawnier 2007 Tundra, which goes on sale in mid-February, will begin at $22,290 for the most basic model and go as high as $41,850. The Chevrolet Silverado, which also was revamped for 2007, has a base price of $17,860, while Ford's F-series, the segment's longtime leader, starts at $18,275.  Of the six full-size pickups available in the United States, only the Nissan Titan has a higher starting price, and none has a high-end price greater than the Tundra's. Last year's Tundra ranged in price from $16,155 to $33,575.  Jesse Toprak, an analyst with Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice, said the Toyota pickup cost about $1,100 more than the most popular version of the Chevrolet Silverado, which was introduced late last year.  ''Toyota is confident in their new product. They know their brand strength will probably carry the price point,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''They hope that people who buy this truck will not need a good deal or a high incentive -- they'll buy the vehicle on its merits.''  ''Perhaps that's a little bit arrogant,'' he went on, ''but it's been kind of their continuing strategy.''  Comparing prices for similarly equipped pickup trucks is difficult, because manufacturers offer multiple cab sizes, bed lengths, engine sizes and suspensions.  There are 31 versions of the Tundra and dozens more of the Silverado.  The risk for Toyota will be if consumers conclude it is too expensive after comparison shopping on the Internet. ''They may be out of the consideration sets of some consumers, simply because it has the highest price,'' Mr. Toprak said.  Toyota considers the new Tundra, built in San Antonio as well as Princeton, Ind., to be the most important vehicle it has ever sold in the United States. It expects to sell about 200,000 trucks a year, primarily to owners of other Toyota vehicles who purchased pickups from G.M., Ford and Chrysler.  Automakers sold about 2.3 million big pickup trucks in the United States last year. Sales of the F-series dropped 11.7 percent in 2006, which Ford attributed to a spike in gasoline prices and a slowdown in the housing market, which caused contractors to delay purchasing new trucks.  To counter the shift toward more fuel-efficient vehicles, Detroit's automakers have been offering discounts of several thousand dollars on their pickups, making the price gap between the new Tundra and a truck like the F-series even larger.  A G.M. spokesman, John M. McDonald, said the automaker was confident that the Silverado, which was named the North American truck of the year at this month's Detroit auto show, would have little trouble competing against the Tundra, regardless of the price Toyota sets.  ''It speaks to the fact that American automakers can produce a truck that has the best quality and sell it at a price that is as good as or better than the competition,'' Mr. McDonald said.  ",

                    "text": "  THE dollar fell against many currencies in 2006, and many Wall Street analysts are predicting more of the same this year.  That needn't worry investors, who could profit from a continued decline in many ways. But some strategists caution that it may be wiser to try to benefit indirectly from a weaker dollar -- by holding stocks or stock funds focused on certain industries and countries -- than by betting directly on foreign currencies.  ''You've got to know your limitations,'' said Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's. ''Unless you make millions of dollars on Wall Street, you probably shouldn't be speculating in currencies.''  In 2006, the dollar fell 10.2 percent against the euro and 12 percent against the British pound, although it rose 1.1 percent against the Japanese yen.  Mr. Stovall said the best move for most individual investors would be to stock up on the shares of American multinational corporations that earn a lot of their revenues abroad, as well as on foreign stocks. ''We feel that many foreign economies are not as far along in their economic cycle, and they have good growth potential now,'' he said.  He recommended that individual investors allocate 40 percent of their total portfolios to domestic stocks, 20 percent to foreign stocks, 25 percent to domestic bonds and 15 percent to cash instruments like money market accounts and certificates of deposit.  In terms of domestic stocks, he favors large stocks like those in the S.& P. 500- stock index. On average, the companies in this index earn 41 percent of their revenue in foreign countries.  ''If you believe that international economies are going to do fairly well, and the dollar is likely to weaken,'' Mr. Stovall said, ''then you could get a good bit of tailwind if you transfer those foreign profits back to U.S. dollars.''  But averages can hide wide variances. Some industries represented in the S.& P. 500 draw much more of their revenue abroad than others. Companies in the energy and technology sectors, for example, generate well over half of their sales outside the United States, while the utilities and telecommunications companies in the index produce a vast majority of their revenue at home. For example, the handful of telecommunications providers in the index get just 3 percent of their revenue, on average, in foreign countries.  Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, has recommended European stocks for a few years. He said that individual investors should now focus on developed markets -- and that if they have made a lot of money in emerging markets funds in recent years, they may want to consider rebalancing their portfolios. ''You have to be a little bit concerned that emerging-markets debt and equity may have gotten a bit ahead of themselves,'' he said.  Mr. Schweitzer said that any further appreciation of the euro could be modest this year. Still, he added, European stocks were appealing investments for a host of other reasons. He pointed out that the average dividend yield in the S.& P. 500 index was now 1.8 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the MSCI United Kingdom index and 2.5 percent for the MSCI Europe index, excluding Britain. For Americans investing in Britain or on the continent, a further slide by the dollar against the pound or the euro could bolster those dividend advantages.  ''Meanwhile, European companies are cutting costs and restructuring, and that's starting to show up in their earnings growth,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. Earnings per share for European stocks, he said, grew almost twice as fast in the first five years of this decade as they did during the last five years of the 1990s.  On the fixed-income side of their portfolios, some investors may be tempted to profit directly from a falling dollar by buying foreign bonds or CDs. But Martin J. Mauro, the fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he didn't think the time was ripe for investing in foreign bonds.  Interest rates are likely to fall in the United States this year but rise in many other countries, Mr. Mauro said. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, so both European and Asian bonds would generally be unattractive for American investors, he said.  Many economists predict that the dollar will fall further against the Japanese yen than it will against the euro -- largely because the dollar rose slightly against the yen in 2006. S.& P. forecasts a dollar decline of 6.8 percent against the yen this year; Merrill Lynch sees a decline of 10 percent.  But Mr. Mauro said American investors would be giving up too much yield if they bought Japanese bonds or CDs. Short-term interest rates are less than 1 percent in Japan, versus 5 percent in the United States.  And Mr. Mauro said he expected the dollar to fall by only an additional 1 percent or so against the euro -- which he said wouldn't be quite enough to make up for the yield that Americans would sacrifice by buying European bonds or CDs. One-year government bills in the United States currently pay around 5 percent, versus 3.9 percent in Germany.  For now, he recommends high-quality domestic bonds. He said typical individual investors should put at most 5 percent of their bond portfolios into high-yield bonds, and none into emerging-market debt. Although short-term rates are relatively high, he recommends intermediate maturities -- 5 to 15 years -- because he expects domestic interest rates to be lower next year.  ''If we're right, and the economy weakens and the Fed cuts rates, then what investors will earn on short-term rates will be a lot less next year,'' he said. ''It's a tough move to make now, but they'll be better off a year from now'' if they buy longer-maturity bonds or CDs today.  FINALLY, if investors are really worried about the dollar, Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, advises them to put about 5 percent of their portfolios into gold. He recommends buying the metal through an exchange-traded fund like StreetTracks Gold Shares or the iShares Comex Gold Trust  -- both of which are backed by bars of gold in a vault. He predicted that gold could rise as much as 20 percent in 2007, to around $750 an ounce.  A falling dollar, Mr. Metz said, may prompt foreign central banks to sell some their dollar reserves to buy gold. He also said that rising incomes across Asia could become a factor. ''The great theme of this century,'' he said, ''will be the enormous transfer of wealth to developing nations, where they have traditionally used gold as a store of value.''

                    "text": "  A Queens grand jury that will weigh evidence in the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man on his wedding day in November will begin hearing testimony next week, lawyers involved in the case said yesterday.  Two months after the unarmed man, Sean Bell, was killed and two of his friends were wounded in a fusillade of 50 police bullets, prosecutors are expected to begin presenting evidence and calling witnesses before the panel, the lawyers said.  ''My understanding is that they should begin presenting on Monday,'' said Michael Hardy, a lawyer who represents the woman Mr. Bell was to marry, Nicole Paultre Bell (she took his name after his death), and the two men wounded in the shooting.  The office of the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, declined to comment or answer questions about the grand jury process. ''The investigation is continuing,'' said Meris Campbell, a spokeswoman.  Mr. Hardy, lawyers representing some of the five officers involved in the shooting and others said they expected the grand jury's work would last at least three weeks. The two men wounded in the Nov. 25 shooting, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, intend to testify, said Mr. Hardy, and will most likely do so toward the end of the grand jury process.  ''They are crucial witnesses,'' he said. ''And that, obviously, will present a very significant challenge to whatever testimony is given by the officers who did the shooting, if any.''  Of the officers who fired at Mr. Bell, two are black, one is black and Hispanic, and two are white.  In recent weeks, four of the five officers have given investigators for the Queens district attorney's office their version of events. The fifth, Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, has not spoken to prosecutors, according to one lawyer involved in the case.  But it remained unclear yesterday if Detective Oliver planned to testify before the grand jury or speak with prosecutors, and his lawyer did not return phone calls seeking comment.  Paul P. Martin, a lawyer who represents Detective Marc Cooper, said his client would testify before the grand jury. ''My client's actions were reasonable under the circumstances and justified,'' he said.  It is unclear if Detective Paul Headley will testify. A lawyer for another officer, the undercover detective who fired the first of the 50 shots, has said his client intended to testify. Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer for Officer Michael Carey, said he was ''reserving judgment'' on whether his client would testify.  Officers who face grand juries in Queens can find themselves in one of several rooms that look like college lecture halls, with seats in tiered rows. There are some grand juries that sit for a month at a time, and one that sits for six months, though each can be extended. It is unclear which type will hear the Bell case.  ",

                    "text": "  PORK tenderloin, like its relative the beef tenderloin (sometimes called filet mignon), is among the leanest cuts of meat. Its versatility, ease of cooking and eating -- there are no bones and essentially no fat -- and relatively low price have made it popular.  But the lack of fat means a lack of flavor. It also means that if you cook the meat to well-done, as one typically does with pork, it tends to dry out.  There are a number of ways to cope with these challenges, including wrapping medallions in bacon and roasting the whole tenderloin in a flavorful coating. But a friend has come up with a new one.  In a Paris bistro he was served medallions that had been broiled and then sauced. They were good, he reported, but the unbrowned sides were unattractive.  ''I thought that if I cooked the entire cut and got it crisp on the outside, then cut the meat into steaks and browned them on their 'faces,' I'd get even better results,'' he said. ''And indeed mine were much better.''  To follow his lead: Brown the whole tenderloin (usually about the right amount for four people). Let it rest for a few minutes, so the meat firms up a bit. Then slice the tenderloin into medallions, about an inch thick. Brown the slices on both sides and build a sauce in the pan.  I've chosen a simple French-style cream reduction, but you can take the sauce in any direction you like. The relatively bland flavor of the meat will take to almost anything.  Twice-Cooked Pork Tenderloin  Time: 25 minutes  1 boneless pork tenderloin, about 1 pound  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  4 tablespoons butter, extra virgin olive oil, or a combination  1/4 cup cream  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, lemon juice or Calvados, optional  Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish, optional.  1.  Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper. Put a large skillet over medium-high heat; a minute later add 2 tablespoons butter and/or oil. When butter foam subsides or oil dimples, add meat (curve it into skillet if necessary). Brown it well on all sides, for a total of 4 to 6 minutes. Turn off heat, remove meat from pan, and let it sit on a board. When skillet has cooled a bit, proceed.  2.  Cut meat into inch-thick slices. Once again turn heat to medium-high, add remaining butter and/or oil and, when it's hot, add pork slices to pan. Brown on each side, about 2 or 3 minutes each. Turn heat to low and remove meat to a warm platter.  3.  Add  1/2 cup water to pan, turn heat to high, and cook, stirring and scraping, for a minute. Lower heat slightly, add cream and cook until slightly thickened. Stir in mustard, lemon juice or Calvados, if you're using them, then taste and adjust seasoning. Serve meat with sauce spooned on top, garnished, if you like, with parsley.  Yield: 4 servings.  THE MINIMALIST  ",

                    "text": "  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations made progress toward its goal of economic and political integration at a summit meeting here on Saturday, but it was sidetracked by tensions over how to deal with Myanmar, which has come under fire for its poor human rights record.  Leaders of the 10 members of the organization, known as Asean, agreed to establish a free-trade zone by 2015, intensify their fight against terrorism, protect the region's migrant workers and improve their campaign against H.I.V./AIDS. They also agreed to draft a new charter with broad enforcement powers -- a break from the 40-year-old group's tradition of consensus and noninterference.  ''We want to advance the sense of community in our shared interest to look after each other in terms of justice, economic development and common security,'' President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines said during her speech at the opening of the meeting.  Mrs. Arroyo emphasized Asean's drive to expand trade, ''to create one of the world's greatest trading blocs.''  But the group failed to find common ground on Myanmar, formerly Burma. On Friday, China and Russia vetoed a United States resolution in the United Nations Security Council that criticized Myanmar's persecution of opposition groups.  ''How are we going to help you if you are not making progress?'' Indonesia's president, Bambang Susilo Yudhoyono, told Myanmar's officials late Friday, according to Reuters.  Nitya Pibulsonggram, Thailand's foreign minister, told reporters on Saturday that Asean should redouble its efforts ''to see what we can do to help one another,'' to give the Myanmar issue what he called ''a regional focus'' rather than ''have it internationalized.''  Asean's new charter, which will be drafted this year, is expected to include mechanisms to monitor and enforce agreements among members, along the lines of the European Union's charter.  Two years ago, Asean formed a body called the Eminent Persons Group to create guidelines for the new charter. On Friday, it released a list of 28 recommendations, including the ''strengthening of democratic values, good governance, rejection of unconstitutional and undemocratic changes of government, respect of the rule of law, including international humanitarian law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.''  In a sense, the charter is a bid to remain relevant as the economic power of China and India grows, something the group itself acknowledged. ''While the Asean charter will bring about a long overdue legal framework, Asean must reposition itself,'' it said in a statement. ''It must address the growing challenges and opportunities of regional integration, the major shifts in the Asian landscape brought about by the rise of China and India, and Asia's widening links with the rest of the world.'' China and India are not members of Asean.  Asean leaders also signed a counterterrorism agreement that, among other things, makes it obligatory for each member country to share information about terrorist suspects and possibly allow their extradition. The accord called on members to disrupt terrorist financing and to train counterterrorism forces.  Southeast Asia is home to some of the world's deadliest terrorist groups, among them Jemaah Islamiyah, which has links to Al Qaeda, and Abu Sayyaf, a group in the southern Philippines.  Asean's members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  ",

                    "text": "  As fighting began to flare Sunday around Kismayo, in southern Somalia, the final redoubt for the country's diminished Islamic movement, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.  Muhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.  ''We told them that they were going to lose,'' Mr. Arab said, ''and that our city would get destroyed.''  Kismayo, a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the East African spice empire, has been spared the fighting so far. But the Islamists, Mr. Arab said, did not care. ''These guys are bent on war,'' he said.  The fighting started around 5 p.m., with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib, a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo.  [Residents of Kismayo told Reuters Monday that Somali Islamists fled overnight from their final stronghold around the southern port of the city. Several thousand Somalia Islamic Courts Council fighters had been making a last stand north of Kismayo port, but residents said they melted away after the advancing Ethiopian force began its shelling of Jilib. Somalia's interim government vowed to pursue them.]  As the shells began to rain down in Jilib, residents said, clan militias in Kismayo turned on the Islamists.  That set off running gun battles across the city, with several people reported killed. It also accelerated the exodus from Kismayo, with thousands of residents hastily gathering a few belongings and joining the stream of people fleeing the fighting in southern Somalia.  It is hard to predict what is going to happen next. Local support for the Islamists in Kismayo is obviously evaporating, just as it did last week in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, when clan elders decided that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.  That led to the city falling much faster than anyone expected into the hands of Somalia's transitional government, which has used Ethiopian troops and airpower to reclaim much of the country. Clan elders are the pillars of Somali society, and many of the Islamist fighters in Mogadishu were clan militiamen lent to the movement.  But the fighters in Kismayo may be different. Kismayo is where the Islamist leadership fled after losing Mogadishu, taking their most steadfast and hard-core fighters.  Ethiopian officials have said that the Somali Islamists are bolstered by several thousand foreign fighters -- from Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Libya and Eritrea, Ethiopia's bitter enemy, though American intelligence officials have said that the numbers are far fewer, most likely in the hundreds.  Diplomats are still searching for a way to avert disaster. On Sunday, Kenyan officials, with American encouragement, continued to meet in Nairobi with the few remaining moderate leaders of the Islamist movement in an effort to reach a cease-fire. But the talks were slow-going, said an official close to the parties.  In Mogadishu, the transitional prime minister, Ali Mohammed Gedi, seems to relish his newfound authority. Mr. Gedi, a bookish veterinarian whom few Somalis would have recognized before last week's stunning comeback by the transitional government, is holding daily news conferences, meeting with clan elders and surveying bombed-out buildings for future office space. On Sunday, he reassured the populace in confident tones that the era of warlord rule was over.  ",

                    "text": "  Among its many capital improvement projects, New Jersey Transit is considering introducing a train line that would run from Manhattan and Hoboken to Scranton, Pa., along the Route 80 corridor.  Called the Lackawanna Cutoff, the proposed line is an 88-mile stretch of level ground that was once used by the Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad and later by Conrail, which abandoned its right of way more than two decades ago and removed the tracks. New Jersey Transit bought the land in 2001.  ''We're advancing this project, including public meetings this month,'' said Joe Dee, a New Jersey Transit spokesman. The plan has a projected cost of $551 million, not including the purchase of property for stations. An environmental assessment and conceptual design are due this year.  The Lackawanna Cutoff line would employ diesel-powered trains and have stops in Andover and Blairstown in New Jersey and Analomink, the Delaware Water Gap, East Stroudsburg, Pocono Mountain, Scranton and Tobyhanna in Pennsylvania.  It is not clear when service could begin. ''A timeline for future phases of the project will be contingent on funding availability,'' Mr. Dee said.  Mr. Dee said that the departure of George D. Warrington, who has said he is stepping down as executive director of New Jersey Transit at the end of March, would have no effect on the Lackawanna Cutoff project.  JOHN HOLL  THE WEEK  ",

Bernard McMahon took part in the ceremony.  Mrs. Somary is the managing director of the Mendelssohn Project, a nonprofit organization founded in Manhattan and Stuttgart, Germany, by the bridegroom, its music director. Its goal is to record all the works of Felix Mendelssohn, and Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, his sister.  The bride, 28, graduated from Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum in Germany. She is a daughter of Ingeborg and Karl Nied of Heilbronn, Germany. Her father is a municipal surveying engineer for Heilbronn.  Mr. Somary, 42, has conducted the Bronx Arts Ensemble and the Amor Artis Chorus and Orchestra.  He is a son of Anne and Johannes Somary of Riverdale, the Bronx, who retired as music teachers at Horace Mann High School there. The bridegroom's father, a choral conductor, is the music director of Amor Artis, which he founded.  Mendelssohn's ''Wedding March'' would have seemed a certainty for the wedding. But the couple chose the ''Trumpet Voluntary'' of Jeremiah Clarke.  ''As great a piece as the Mendelssohn 'Wedding March' is, it has become such a clich\u00e9,'' Mr. Somary said.

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  In ''Legislature: Learn to Say No'' (editorial, Dec. 31), you advocate the ''simple step'' of raising the restriction on charter school enrollment to ease the burden of education costs on localities. You also claim that ''many charter schools do a superb job.'' Where is the evidence?  In most of Connecticut's charter schools, the percentage of students meeting targets on the Connecticut Mastery Test and Connecticut Academic Performance Test is below the state average -- sometimes well below. This evidence is consistent with the conclusions of studies conducted across this country -- that students in charter schools do no better than those in traditional public schools, on state tests and on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The one, admittedly limited, study finding promise in Connecticut's charter schools attributes a large part of this success precisely to the state's strict limits on expansion that you decry.  Where charter schools succeed in Connecticut, there is no evidence that ''educational innovation'' is at play, as you claim, rather than longer school hours, smaller schools and smaller class sizes than those in traditional public schools. These conditions have been long known to educators and parents to raise student achievement. They should be made available to all of our public school children, not just the select few who attend charter schools.

The phone, which comes in a dark blue rubberized finish with chrome accents, has a full keyboard, bright color touch screen and 1.3-megapixel camera. But road warriors will appreciate its more business-oriented features, like a dedicated mute switch on the top, a MiniSD card slot for memory expansion and a speakerphone for meetings on the go.  The 750 supports Bluetooth wireless networking and four international G.S.M. bands. It can jump onto Cingular's fast wireless data network for video, audio and document downloads, and can connect to most e-mail providers using Microsoft Outlook Mobile and Microsoft's push e-mail systems.  Windows users can synchronize their contacts and calendar entries with home PCs using the included software, and the phone can open and edit most Microsoft Office documents.

                    "text": "  Wesley Autrey teetered back and forth on the edge of a subway platform yesterday, re-enacting how he dived onto the tracks of a southbound No. 1 train in Manhattan on Tuesday to save another man's life.  A little boy with black hair and a bowl cut followed each of his moves. Other passers-by at the 137th Street station let loose the occasional hurrah or hand clap. Still others riffled through newspapers, which featured Mr. Autrey's picture and headlines like ''Subway Superman.''  A few subway stops away, at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center on 114th street near Amsterdam Avenue, Cameron Hollopeter underwent a second day of medical evaluation. Police said Mr. Hollopeter, a first-year film student at the New York Film Academy, had suffered a seizure, which sent him convulsing off the platform and onto the tracks, where Mr. Autrey held him down as the train rumbled just inches above them.  Moments after the train came to a halt, Mr. Autrey recounted yesterday, Mr. Hollopeter asked if he was dead. ''I said, 'You are very much alive, but if you move you'll kill the both of us.' '' Both men emerged from the episode with little more than bruises, but Mr. Autrey also emerged a star.  Mr. Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker, said he knew something was different when he showed up for work later on Tuesday. His boss, he said, bought him lunch -- a ham-and-cheese hero -- and later told him to take yesterday off.  Then yesterday morning, as he walked to his mother's apartment in Harlem, ''a stranger came up and put $10 in my hand,'' he said. ''People in my neighborhood were like, 'Yo, I know this guy.' ''  Once at his mother's apartment, he held interviews in the living room with some of the national morning news programs.  After that, it was back to the scene, where he recounted Mr. Hollopeter's backward tumble off the platform and into the path of the oncoming train.  Throughout the day, Mr. Autrey's sister, Linda, 48, played the role of administrative assistant, logging invitations for the talk-show circuit, including requests from the David Letterman, Charlie Rose and Ellen DeGeneres shows. Phone calls from well-wishers came pouring in, including one from the mayor's office. Mr. Autrey said he had been offered cash, trips and scholarships for his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, who watched as he dived to the trackbed.  ''Donald Trump's got a check waiting on me,'' he said. ''They offered to mail it; I said, 'No, I'd like to meet the Donald, so I can say, Yo, you're fired.' ''  By the end of the day, the president of the New York Film Academy, Jerry Sherlock, had personally handed him a $5,000 check.  Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Autrey and Mr. Hollopeter met again. The meeting was closed to reporters, but afterward Mr. Autrey described how he stepped into Mr. Hollopeter's hospital room, where they shared a few laughs as Mr. Hollopeter's father stood by with tears in his eyes.  Shortly after 4 p.m., Mr. Autrey walked out of the hospital with Mr. Hollopeter's father, Larry, and into a throng of more than 30 reporters and camera operators who jammed microphones into their faces.  ''This is Cameron's father,'' Mr. Autrey began. ''He's a very, very, nice, nice man and, you know, I'm not used to this press,'' he said, as reporters shouted at them to lean closer to the microphones and camera shutters popped like party favors.  Mr. Hollopeter was nervous, his hands shaking, as he read from handwritten notes.  ''Mr. Autrey's instinctive and unselfish act ---- '' Mr. Hollopeter said, hesitating, as reporters inched closer. ''There are no words to properly express our gratitude and feelings for his actions. Cameron is recovering and stable. Now he needs his rest, and our wishes are that you respect his privacy. May God's blessings be with Mr. Autrey and his family.''  The teary father then slipped back into the hospital, apparently overcome with emotion.  ''Me and the families are trying to make some plans so his family can meet my family and we can have a little gathering,'' Mr. Autrey said, before breaking into a hearty laugh. ''Without the media!''  Mr. Autrey was asked to reflect on the experience.  ''Maybe I was in the right place at the right time, and good things happen for good people,'' Mr. Autrey said.  Then he hopped into his brother-in-law's tan Toyota Corolla. As the car pulled away, Mr. Autrey had some final words: ''All New Yorkers! If you see somebody in distress, go for it!''  ",

One difference is that some new HD-DVD discs are sold in a combination format that will also play on standard DVD players, while Blu-Ray discs currently do not have this feature.  ",

                    "text": "  THE flow of earnings reports will pick up this week, but the earnings themselves are expected to show a dip in growth from past quarters. Any impact on share prices may depend on investors' expectations about those expectations.  Standard & Poor's estimates that earnings for companies in its 500-stock index rose by 9 percent, year over year, in the fourth quarter. That would be a healthy gain, but also the worst one in nearly five years, said Sam Stovall, S.& P.'s chief investment strategist.  ''This would be the first quarter in 19 where we've had a single-digit advance,'' he said.  But it has not been 19 quarters, or even two, since analysts last forecast single-digit growth.  Earnings estimates started off low for just about every quarter during the four-year bull market and then nudged up continually as fresh numbers came in. S.& P.'s forecast is close to those of other research firms, Mr. Stovall noted, but investors may still be disappointed if results meet expectations and nothing more.  ''Earnings are not going to grow at double digits forever,'' he said. ''The real question is: Is Wall Street prepared for the first single-digit advance in 19 quarters?''  One of the first big-name companies to report is Alcoa, which Mr. Stovall likened to a corporate Iowa for its status as a periodic bellwether.  S.& P. projects 150 percent earnings growth for aluminum producers, of which Alcoa is the biggest, and a result in that neighborhood on Tuesday would augur well for fourth-quarter earnings generally, and for 2007 economic activity, he said.  No triple-digit, or even double-digit, gain is foreseen for smaller companies. After increasing earnings at an annual rate of 17 percent or more in each quarter of last year, the S.& P. 600 index of smaller companies is expected to show growth of just 5 percent for the last quarter.  The gap in earnings growth is just one reason that Mr. Stovall expects investors to find larger companies more appealing than smaller ones this year. Smaller companies' run of outperformance is looking long in the tooth after seven years, he said, and indications of softening economic conditions could steer investors toward the comparative safety that blue chips are thought to offer.  ''It's getting later in the stock market and economic cycle,'' he said. ''When sailing into an impending storm, sailors prefer a larger ship.''  DATA WATCH -- The highlight of a thin post-holiday economic calendar may be the report on Wednesday of the nation's trade balance for November.  A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts a widening deficit, to $60 billion from $58.9 billion in October.  Retail sales for December, to be reported on Friday, are expected to rise by 0.6 percent after a 1.0 percent increase in November.  MARKET WEEK  ",

Bloomberg announced yesterday that Coney Island Commons had been selected to develop a community center and moderate-cost housing near Surf Avenue in Coney Island. The project, expected to start in the fall of 2008 and finish the following summer, involves the construction of 152 housing units in two buildings between West 29th and West 30th Streets, of which 75 percent will be for low- and moderate-income people. The $56 million development is also expected to provide a 40,000-square-foot community center that will be operated by the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York.  ",

                    "text": "  A New Jersey lawyer pleaded not guilty to prostitution and money-laundering charges yesterday as his lawyer accused the Manhattan district attorney of letting his ''personal feelings'' influence the prosecution.  An assistant district attorney, Linda Ford, said during the arraignment of the lawyer, Paul W. Bergrin, that he had not only helped run a brothel at 79 Worth Street in Lower Manhattan but had patronized the establishment and had brought friends to the brothel for free sex.  But a lawyer for Mr. Bergrin, Jeffrey Lichtman, accused the district attorney's office of inflating the seriousness of the charges by asking that his client be held in jail without bail.  ''Counsel can only surmise that the tremendous publicity surrounding this case and the district attorney's personal feelings toward the defendant have influenced the draconian request for detention,'' Mr. Lichtman wrote in a brief.  Justice Michael R. Ambrecht of State Supreme Court in Manhattan later set Mr. Bergrin's bail at $1 million bond or $500,000 cash, with 72 hours for prosecutors to review the source of the money.  A spokesman for District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau declined to comment yesterday.  Mr. Bergrin, 51, of Morganville, N.J., is a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. He is accused of using two shell companies in 2004 and 2005 to launder $800,000 in credit card receipts from a call girl service based in TriBeCa named NY Confidential, prosecutors have said.  Mr. Lichtman said that Jason Itzler, the brothel's founder and Mr. Bergrin's client, had been accused of laundering millions in prostitution money -- as opposed to the $800,000 Mr. Bergrin is accused of laundering.  Yet Mr. Itzler was released on $250,000 bail after his indictment in 2005, and was sentenced last week to one and a half to three years in prison, Mr. Lichtman said.  ",

                    "text": "  More than 30 rescuers withstood cold winds that swept across Northwest Harbor on Tuesday to successfully herd several dolphins out of an inlet off Long Island where they have been stranded for at least a week.  Banging on partly submerged metal pipes and revving their engines, the dolphin wranglers maneuvered eight boats to corral the dolphins and push them past a shoal that has discouraged the animals from returning to open waters.  The pod, frightened and disoriented, refused to stay together. But in two separate drives the rescuers were able to move 6 to 13 dolphins into deeper water.  ''We're real happy with the success we've had today,'' said Chuck Hamilton, a regional supervisor for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. ''It's truly amazing that they got these animals out. A lot of credit is due to the skillful boat operators.''  When dealing with a mass stranding, the decision to corral and drive the animals is a serious one.  ''We don't take it lightly,'' said Kathy Zagzebski, executive director of the National Marine Life Center, adding that the stress of being corralled could cause the dolphins to beach themselves.  The marine center, in Buzzards Bay, Mass., is used to such rescue endeavors; the center's coastal region is known as a hot spot for marine animal stranding.  Katie Touhey, executive director and senior scientist at the Cape Cod Stranding Network, the group that provided a high-frequency pinger system that rescuers have been using to help move the dolphins out of the Northwest Harbor inlet, said that if corralling fails, then rescuers could use nets to capture and move the dolphins.  ''But capturing is super-stressful,'' Ms. Touhey said, ''and it should be avoided at all costs.''  Five dolphins stranded in the choppy waters of the Northwest Harbor area have already died, possibly of starvation, including one that washed up on shore Tuesday morning, Mr. Hamilton said. Another dolphin was euthanized.  There are plans to continue the rescue effort on Wednesday. Rescuers estimated that three to five animals were still in the inlet. There are concerns that the dolphins that made it out of the inlet may respond to the distress calls of those still stranded.  Chuck Bowman, president of the Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation, noted that it has been hard to get an accurate count of how many have been stranded.  ''It's not like we can say, 'Everybody stop and put up your flippers,' '' he said.  ",

                    "text": "  Bosch has found the radiation victim's Toyota in an alley not far from the overlook, and inside it, many objects asociated with Stanley Kent's murder, particularly the cesium. In the process, however, Bosch, too, has been exposed to the radiation.  The car jerked forward as Walling pulled out of the alley and into southbound traffic on Cahuenga.  ''I'm taking you back to Queen of Angels so Dr. Gardner can have a look at you,'' she said. ''Just hang in there for me, Bosch.''  He knew that the last-name endearments were probably about to come to an end. He pointed toward the left-turn lane that led onto Barham Boulevard.  ''Never mind the hospital,'' he said. ''Take me back to the Kent house.''  ''What?''  ''I'll get checked out later. Go to the Kent house. Here's the turn.''  She slipped into the left-turn lane.  ''What are you telling me, that that little fainting spell back there was -- ''  ''I had to get you away from the crime scene and away from Brenner so I could check this out and talk to you.''  ''Check what out? Talk about what? Do you realize what you just did? I thought I was saving your life. Now Brenner or one of those other guys will take the credit for the recovery. Thanks a lot. That was my crime scene.''  He opened his jacket and pulled out the rolled and folded-over yoga poster.  ''Don't worry about it,'' he said. ''You can get the credit for the arrests. You just might not want it.''  He opened the poster, letting the top half flop over his knees. He was interested in only the bottom half.  ''Dhanurasana,'' he said.  Walling glanced over at him and then down at the poster.  ''Would you start telling me what's going on?''  ''Alice Kent practices yoga. I saw the mats in the workout room at the house.''  ''I saw them, too. So what?''  ''Did you see the sun discoloration on the wall where a picture or a calendar or maybe a poster had been taken down?''  ''Yes, I saw it.''  Bosch held up the poster.  ''I'm betting that we go in there and this will be a perfect fit. This is a poster Gonzalves found with the cesium.''  ''And what will that mean -- if it's a perfect fit?''  ''It will mean Alice Kent conspired to kill her husband, and if it hadn't been for Digiberto Gonzalves, it would have been a perfect crime.''  Walling shook her head dismissively.  ''Come on, Harry. Are you saying she conspired with international terrorists to kill her husband in exchange for the cesium? I can't believe I am even doing this. I need to get back to the crime scene.''  She started checking her mirrors, getting ready to make a U-turn. They were going up Lake Hollywood Drive now and would be at the house in two minutes.  ''No, keep going. We're almost there. Alice Kent conspired with someone, but it wasn't a terrorist. The cesium being dumped in the trash proves that. You said it yourself, there is no way that Moby and Elfayed would steal this stuff to just dump it. So what does that tell you? This wasn't a heist. It actually was a murder. The cesium was just a red herring. Moby and Elfayed? They were part of the misdirection. And this poster will help prove it.''  ''How?''  ''Dhanurasana, the rocking bow.''  He held the poster up so she could glance at the yoga pose depicted in the bottom corner. It showed a woman with her arms behind her back, holding her ankles and creating a bow with the front of her body. She looked as if she were hogtied.  Walling glanced back at the curving road and then took another long look at the poster and the pose.  ''We go into the house and see if this fits that space on the wall,'' Bosch said. ''If it fits, that means she and the killer took it off the wall because they didn't want to risk that we might see it and connect it with what happened to her.''  ''It's a stretch, Harry. A huge one.''  ''Not when you put it in context.''  ''Which you, of course, can do.''  ''As soon as we get to the house.''  ''Hope you still have a key.''  ''You bet I do.''  Walling turned onto Arrowhead Drive and punched the accelerator. But after a block she took her foot off, slowed down and shook her head again.  ''This is ridiculous. She gave us the name Moby. There is no way she could have known he was in this country. And then up on the overlook, your own witness said that the shooter called out to Allah as he pulled the trigger. How can -- ''  ''Let's try the poster on the wall. If it fits, I'll lay the whole thing out for you. I promise. If it doesn't fit, then I will quit bothering you with it.''  She relented and drove the remaining block to the Kent house without another word. There was no longer a bureau car sitting out front. Bosch guessed that it was all hands on deck at the cesium-recovery scene.  ''Thank God I don't have to deal with Maxwell again,'' he said.  Walling didn't even smile.  Bosch got out with the poster and his file containing the crime-scene photos. He used Stanley Kent's keys to open the front door, and they proceeded to the workout room. They took positions on either side of the rectangular discoloration, and Bosch unrolled the poster. They each took a side and held the top corners of the poster to the top corners of the mark. Bosch put his other hand on the center of the poster and flattened it against the wall. The poster was a perfect fit.  Rachel immediately let go of her side and headed out of the room.  ''I'll be in the living room. I can't wait to hear you put this together.''  Bosch rolled the poster up and followed. Walling took a seat in the same chair Bosch put Maxwell in a few hours earlier. He remained standing in front of her.  ''The fear was that the poster could be a tip-off,'' he said. ''Some smart agent or detective would see the rocking-bow pose and start thinking, This woman does yoga, maybe she could handle being hogtied like that. Maybe it was her idea, maybe she did it to help sell the misdirection. So they couldn't take the chance. The poster had to go. It went into the Dumpster with the cesium, the gun and everything else they used. If you get your people out there to check that line of Dumpsters, you'll find the rest -- the Coke-bottle silencer, the ski mask, the gloves, the first set of snap ties, every -- ''  ''The first set of snap ties?''  ''That's right. I'll get to that.''  Walling looked unimpressed.  ''You better get to a lot of it. Because there are big gaps in this thing, man. What about the name Moby? What about the citing of Allah by the shooter? What -- ''  Bosch held up a hand.  ''Just hold on,'' he said. ''I need some water. My throat is raw from all of this talking.''  He went into the kitchen, remembering that he saw bottles of chilled water in the refrigerator while searching the kitchen earlier.  ''You want anything?'' he called out.  ''No,'' she called back. ''It's not our house, remember?''  He opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle of water and drank half of it while standing in front of the open door. He then went back out to the living room, where Rachel was waiting for the story. Once again, he remained standing.  ''O.K., when was it that you captured the terrorist known as Moby on video at the port?''  ''What does -- ''  ''Please, just answer the question.''  ''Aug. 12.''  ''O.K., Aug. 12. Then what, some sort of alert went out through the bureau and Homeland Security?''  She nodded.  ''Not for a while, though,'' she said. ''It took almost a month of video analysis to confirm it was Nassar and Elfayed. I wrote the bulletin. It went out Sept. 9 as a confirmed domestic sighting.''  ''Out of curiosity, why didn't you go public with it?''  ''Because we have -- actually, I can't tell you.''  ''You just did. You must have someone or someplace where you think these two might show up under surveillance. If you go public, they might just go underground and never show up again.''  ''Can we go back to your story, please?''  ''Fine. So the bulletin went out Sept. 9. That was the day the plan to kill Stanley Kent began.''  Walling folded her arms across her chest and just stared at him. Bosch thought that maybe she was beginning to see where he was going with the story, and she didn't like it.  ''It works best if you start from the end and go backward,'' Bosch said. ''She gave you the name Moby. How could she have gotten that name?''  ''She overheard one of them calling the other one that name.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''No, she told you she overheard it. But if she was lying, how would she know the name to lie about it? Just coincidence that she gives the nickname of a guy who was just discovered in the country -- in L.A. County, no less? I don't think so, Rachel, and neither do you.''  ''O.K., so you're saying that somebody in the bureau or another agency that received the F.B.I. bulletin gave her the name.''  ''That's right. He gave her the name so she could come out with it while being questioned by the F.B.I.'s master interrogator. That one name would then send this whole thing down the wrong road with the F.B.I. and everybody else chasing after terrorists who had nothing to do with it.''  ''He?''  ''I'm getting to that now. You are right, anybody who got a look at that bulletin would have been able to give her that name. My guess is that would be a lot of people. A lot of people just in L.A. alone. So how would we narrow it down to one?''  ''You tell me.''  Bosch opened the bottle and drank the rest of the water. He held the empty bottle in his hand as he continued.  ''You narrow it down by continuing to go backward. Where would Alice Kent's life have intersected with one of those people in the agencies who knew about Moby?''  ''That could be anywhere with those kind of parameters. It could've happened when she was buying fertilizer for her roses.''  ''Then narrow the parameters. Where would she have intersected with someone who knew about Moby but also knew that her husband had access to the sort of radioactive materials Moby might be interested in?''  She shook her head in a disdainful way.  ''Nowhere. It would take a monumental coincidence to -- ''  She stopped when it came to her. There was enlightenment and shock as she fully understood where Bosch was going.  ''My partner and I visited the Kents to warn them a year ago. I guess what you're saying is that that makes me a suspect.''  Bosch shook his head.  ''I said 'he,' remember? You didn't come here alone.''  Her eyes fired when she registered the implication.  ''That's ridiculous. There's no way. I can't believe you would. . . . ''  She didn't finish, as her mind snagged on something, some memory or tell that undermined her trust and loyalty to her partner.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing.''  ''What?''  ''Look,'' she insisted, ''take my advice and tell no one this theory of yours. You're lucky you told me first. Because this makes you sound like some kind of crackpot with a vendetta. You have no evidence, no motive, no incriminating statements, nothing. You just have this thing you've spun out of . . . out of a yoga poster.''  ''There is no other explanation that fits with the facts. And I'm talking about the facts of the case. Not the fact that the bureau and Homeland Security and the rest of the federal government would love this to be a terrorism event so they can justify their existence and deflect criticism from other failings. Contrary to what you want to think, there is evidence and there are incriminating statements. If we put Alice Kent on a lie detector, you'll find out that everything she told me, you and the master interrogator downtown is a lie.''  Walling leaned forward and looked down at the floor.  ''That master interrogator you love deriding happened to be me.''  Bosch's mouth dropped open for a moment before he spoke.  ''Oh . . . well . . . then, sorry . . . but it doesn't matter. The point is, she is a master liar. She lied about everything, and now that we know the story, it will be easy to smoke her out.''  Walling got up from her seat and walked over to the front picture window. The vertical blinds were closed, but she split them with a finger and stared out into the street. Bosch could see her working the story over, grinding it down.  ''What about the witness?'' she asked without turning around. ''He heard the shooter yell, 'Allah.' Are you saying he's part of this?''  Now Bosch sat down and gently tried to clear his throat. It was burning and getting difficult to talk.  ''No, on that I think it's just a lesson in hearing what you want to hear. I plead guilty to not being much of a master interrogator myself. The kid told me that he heard the shooter yell it as he pulled the trigger. He said he wasn't sure but that it sounded like 'Allah,' and that, of course, worked with what I was thinking at the time.''  Walling came away from the window and sat down across from him. She folded her arms again. Bosch continued.  ''But how would he know it was the shooter and not the victim who yelled? He was more than 50 yards away. It was dark. How would he know that it wasn't Stanley Kent yelling out his last word before execution? The name of the woman he loved because he was about to die not even knowing that she'd betrayed him in the worst way.''  ''Alice.''  ''Exactly.''  Walling relaxed her arms and leaned forward. As body language went, it was a good sign. It told Bosch he was pushing through.  ''You said 'the first set of snap ties' before,'' she said. ''What were you talking about?''  Bosch nodded and handed her the file containing the crime-scene photos. He had saved the best for last.  ''Look at the photos,'' he said. ''What do you see?''  She opened the file and started looking at them. They depicted the master bedroom in the Kent house from all angles.  ''It's the master bedroom,'' she said. ''What am I missing?''  ''Exactly.''  ''What?''  ''It's what you don't see. There are no clothes in the shot. She told us they told her to take off her clothes and get on the bed. What are we supposed to believe, that they let her put the clothes away before they hogtied her? They let her put them in the hamper? Look at the last shot. It's the e-mail photo Stanley Kent got.''  Walling looked through the file until she found the printout of the photo. She stared intently at it. He saw recognition break in her eyes.  ''Now what do you see?''  ''The robe,'' she said excitedly. ''When we let her get dressed, she went to the closet to get her robe. There was no robe on that lounge chair!''  Bosch nodded, and they started trading the story back and forth.  ''What does that tell us?'' he asked. ''That these considerate terrorists hung the robe up in the closet for her after taking the photo?''  ''Or that maybe Mrs. Kent was tied up twice and the robe was moved in between?''  ''And look again at the picture. The clock on the bedside table is unplugged.''  ''Why?''  ''I don't know, but maybe they didn't want to worry about having any sort of time stamp on the photo. Maybe the first photo wasn't even taken yesterday. Maybe it came from a dry run two days ago or two weeks.''  Rachel nodded, and Bosch knew she was a believer.  ''She was tied up once for the photo and then once again for the rescue,'' she said.  ''Exactly. And that left her free to help carry out the plan on the overlook. She didn't kill her husband, but she was up there in the other car. And once Stanley was dead and the car was ditched and the cesium dumped, she and her partner came back home, and she was tied up all over again.''  ''She wasn't passed out when we got there,'' Walling said. ''That was an act and part of the plan. And her wetting the bed was a nice little touch to help sell it to us.''  There was no doubt now. Bosch had her. But then the shadow of concern and doubt moved across her face like a summer cloud.  ''What about motive?'' she asked. ''This is a federal agent we're talking about. To move on this we need everything, even motive. There can be nothing left open to chance.''  Bosch had been ready for the question.  ''You saw the motive. Alice Kent is a beautiful woman. Jack Brenner wanted her, and Stanley Kent was in the way of that.''  Walling's eyes widened in shock. Bosch pressed on with his case.  ''That's the motive, Rachel. You -- ''  ''But he -- ''  ''Let me just finish. It goes like this. You and your partner show up here that day last year to give the Kents the warning about his occupation. Some kind of vibe is exchanged between Alice and Jack. He gets interested, she gets interested. They meet on the sly for coffee or drinks or whatever. One thing leads to another. An affair begins, and it lasts, and then it lasts to the point that it's time to start thinking about doing something. Leaving the husband. Or getting rid of him because there's insurance and half a company at stake. That's enough motive right there, Rachel, and that's what this case is about. It's not about cesium or terrorism or anything else. It's sex and murder. That's all.''  She frowned and shook her head.  ''You don't know what you are talking about. Jack Brenner is married and has three children. That's why I wanted him as a partner. He's stable, boring and not interested. He wasn't -- ''  ''Every man is interested. It doesn't matter if they're married or how many kids they have.''  She spoke quietly.  ''Would you listen and let me finish now? You are wrong about Brenner. He never met Alice Kent before today. He wasn't my partner when I came here last year, and I never told you he was.''  Bosch was jolted by the news. He'd assumed that her current partner was her partner last year. He'd had Brenner's image locked and loaded in his mind as he had spun the story.  ''Then who was your partner?'' he asked.  ''I switched partners and hooked up with Jack after the start of the year. Basically, I was tired of my old partner coming on to me. I wanted to move on.''  ''Who was it, Rachel?''  She held his eyes for a long moment.  ''It was Cliff Maxwell.''

Mr. Webb did not say at that point in the conversation, ''That's between me and my boy, Mr. President.'' Mr. Webb did not make that statement until after Mr. Bush had said of the Iraq comment: ''That's not what I asked you. How's your boy?''  The article also referred incorrectly to how Mr. Webb's speech dealt with Democrats' response to the president's Iraq strategy. The speech did not mention whether the party will go beyond a symbolic resolution denouncing Mr. Bush's plan to send more troops to Baghdad.  ",

                    "text": "  Kansas City (9-7) at Indianapolis (12-4)  4:30 p.m., Channel 4  The Colts' offense revolves around quarterback Peyton Manning and receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne, and the Chiefs often struggle to stop the pass. Advantage, Colts.  However, the Colts have allowed 173 yards rushing a game, the most in the league, and the Chiefs have a premier runner in Larry Johnson. He carried 416 times (an N.F.L. record) for 1,789 yards and seemed to thrive on heavy duty. Advantage, Chiefs.  Colts Coach Tony Dungy said he was not concerned with how his team closed the regular season, with losses in four of its final seven games.  ''It's kind of like the Indy 500,'' he said. ''You get that starting position and then you run the race. Everyone remembers who won, not who got the pole.''  Reporter's pick: Colts  Dallas (9-7) at Seattle (9-7)  8 p.m., Channel 4  The coaches -- Bill Parcells of the Cowboys and Mike Holmgren of the Seahawks -- have enjoyed playoff success. So have Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and running back Shaun Alexander, the keys to the Seahawks' offense. Not so Tony Romo, the Cowboys quarterback, and that could be a problem. Dallas's record was 3-3 when the inexperienced Romo replaced Drew Bledsoe. Romo went 5-1 in his first six starts, 1-3 in his last four. He could take advantage of a Seahawks secondary so battered that one starting cornerback is out, the other probably is and three defensive backs were added in recent days. That could also be good news for Terrell Owens, the Cowboys' gifted but talkative receiver.  Reporter's pick: Cowboys  TOMORROW'S MATCHUPS  Jets (10-6) at New England (12-4)  1 p.m., Channel 2  The Jets have won their past three games and beat the Patriots in Week 10, but that was the regular season. For the Patriots, the playoffs are something else. Quarterback Tom Brady's playoff record is 10-1, and he has thrown only 5 interceptions in 11 games. He lacks a go-to receiver, but the Patriots have strong runners in Corey Dillon and Laurence Maroney.  Jets receiver Laveranues Coles said of the Patriots: ''That's the last team you ever want to see in the playoffs because of the way they prepare and the experience they have. I didn't really want to play them in the first round. That's not necessarily a feeling of fear or intimidation. It's more like knowing your opponent a little too well.''  Reporter's pick: Patriots  Giants (8-8) at Philadelphia (10-6)  4:30 p.m., Channel 5  The veteran Jeff Garcia replaced the injured Donovan McNabb (knee) at quarterback and led the Eagles to the National Football Conference East title, Philadelphia's fifth in the past six years. Brian Westbrook, a slick outside runner, also became a force inside as the Eagles won their final five games. ''I believe we are playing our best ball right now,'' safety Brian Dawkins said. The Giants are not; their record is the poorest of the 12 playoff teams. Eli Manning has been inconsistent, Jeremy Shockey is hobbling on a bad ankle, and the defense has its bad days. The one constant has been Tiki Barber, who rushed for a team-record 234 yards last week. He is retiring at 31, so if the Giants lose, this will be his last game.

                    "text": "  ASK New Yorkers to name a classic Greek dish, and many would say moussaka -- gooey layers of eggplant, ground meat and comfort. But a new breed of Greek restaurants here also serves dishes like rabbit phyllo, grilled branzino with artichoke confit and dandelion greens, and Cretan honey-braised lamb shank with yogurt pasta.  Trend-setting chefs like Michael Psilakis at Onera, Christos Valtzoglou at Pylos and Michael Symon at Parea, to name a few, are giving Greek food new vibrancy. Thirty-four Greek restaurants are listed in the latest Zagat guide, 18 of them newcomers since 2000.  So I wondered, as I headed to Greece recently, whether I would encounter inventiveness at restaurants there, too.  As soon as a deconstructed version of a tomato stuffed with rice was placed before me at 48 Restaurant in Athens, I knew I need not have worried. The rice had been typically seasoned with tomato, cinnamon, pine nuts and currants but was shaped like ovals of sushi. Slabs of slow-roasted tomato topped them. That the chef, Christoforos Peskias, has Ferran Adri\u00e0 as a mentor did not surprise me one bit.  As I traveled outside the big cities, I continued to be delighted by the fresh and new. In fact, as long as I stayed away from tourist places, I was in for an adventure.  But some of the most unusual yet simple and delicious food I found was in Rhodes, the large island not far from the coast of Turkey. This food was not obviously modern, but based on a sense of place and on the traditions and ingredients of the island. It's a rustic cuisine that New York restaurants have yet to discover.  I came home with recipes I could not wait to try. Most were from Mavrikos, a 70-year-old family restaurant in Lindos, a town in the southwestern corner of Rhodes known for its beaches and a steep acropolis reached by stairs or donkey. When Lindos was a jet-setting destination, before islands like Mykonos and Patmos were on the social radar screen, Mavrikos had a star-studded clientele. Nelson Rockefeller, members of Pink Floyd and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis stopped by, said Michalis Mavrikos, who runs the restaurant.  Most of the bold-face names have moved on, but Mr. Mavrikos and his brother, Dimitri, the chef, are maintaining the family's culinary traditions in the whitewashed dining room. Every evening, their father, Vassilis, 85, sits in one corner, near the small open kitchen, and casts a critical eye over everything.  For our party of six, Dimitri Mavrikos prepared a tasting menu of about 20 dishes.  (Tackling the recipes for some of them when I got home, I was happy to discover that even the most exotic-tasting dishes called for ingredients that are sold in American health food and Greek specialty stores, and also online.)  Gigantes, as huge, succulent butter beans are called, were simmered in a dark, musky sauce seasoned with carob. ''We can gather the carob pods from trees all around,'' Michalis Mavrikos said.  Fresh local red shrimp were peeled and pounded, raw, into a paste and seasoned with onion, garlic and orange, for a rich alternative to taramosalata. It's a dish I can try now, since fresh Maine shrimp are in season.  Freshly caught tuna loin was cured with sugar, salt and herbs, a little like gravlax, then sliced thin and served with pickled fennel. Gar, a long, skinny fish, was cooked and served in thick grape syrup, like saba, the Italian grape must. Poached skate was seasoned with herbs and pine nuts and formed into a timbale.  Meltingly tender beef had been slow-cooked in a casserole with cracked wheat and seasoned with bergamot, an aromatic citrus fruit that grows on the island and is best known as the flavoring for Earl Grey tea.  ''You are probably thinking that some of these dishes, especially with the cracked wheat and exotic spices, came from Turkey,'' Michalis Mavrikos said. ''I assure you they do not.''  The seasonings for the tuna included fenugreek, a slightly pungent, grassy herb with seeds that can have a celery flavor. Although American cooks may associate it with Indian cooking, it grows wild on Rhodes, as does cumin, another seasoning used in some of the dishes.  If there is any non-Greek influence in the food at Mavrikos, it is likely to be French or Italian. When the Turks controlled Rhodes, the Mavrikos brothers' paternal grandfather moved to Marseilles, where he owned a bistro. When Italy took over Rhodes in 1912 he returned, married an Italian woman and opened the restaurant in 1933. His son, Vassilis, studied cooking in Athens before returning to cook in the family restaurant.  Dimitri Mavrikos said the cooking of his father and grandparents, along with the local traditions, are his most compelling influences.  ''When I plan my menus I first try to find local things, vegetables from the villages, fish from nearby,'' he said. ''But local fresh fish are not as plentiful as they once were and it's getting harder to find them.''  The chef travels, often to London, when the restaurant is closed in winter.  ''I'm always a little sad when I'm abroad,'' he said. ''I often can't find real Greek food and rarely are there any Greek wines.''  Perhaps he should plan a trip to New York, where he'll find Greek wines and respectable and inventive Greek food as well.  Slow-Cooked Beef with Cracked Wheat  Adapted from Mavrikos Restaurant, Rhodes, Greece  Time: 3 1/2 hours  2 1/2 pounds shin of beef, with bone, in 2-inch chunks  2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil  1/2 cup finely chopped onion  1 clove garlic, minced  2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, finely chopped  1 teaspoon coriander seeds  2 bay leaves  4 whole allspice  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 cup dry white wine  3 tablespoons preserved bergamot (see note) 21/3 cups cracked wheat (not instant bulgur).  1.  Place beef in a pot with water to cover, bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes. Drain and dry meat.  2.  Heat oil in a heavy 4-quart casserole, add meat and lightly brown. Add onion, garlic, tomatoes, coriander seeds, bay leaves, allspice, salt and pepper and wine. Simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in bergamot and cracked wheat.  3.  Heat oven to 275 degrees. Transfer contents of casserole to a baking dish large enough to hold ingredients with room to spare. Pour 2 1/2 cups water on top. Bake, uncovered, about 1 1/2 hours. Take a spoon and push down into wheat to make sure it seems quite moist throughout. Add another  1/2 cup or so of water if it seems dry. Top layer of wheat will become crusty. Continue cooking about 1 1/2 hours longer, until wheat is very tender.  4.  Remove from oven. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Use a large spoon to fold ingredients together once or twice, adding salt and pepper if necessary, then serve.  Yield: 6 servings.  Note: Bergamot is sold in Greek shops and at www.titanfood.com as pergamont.  Tomato Sushi  Adapted from 48 Restaurant, Athens  Time: 3 1/2 hours  8 ripe plum tomatoes, about 2 1/4 pounds  3 cloves garlic  2 sprigs fresh thyme  1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, more for brushing  1 medium onion, finely chopped  1 bay leaf  3/4 cup sushi rice  1/2 cup dried currants  2 tablespoons white rum  1/4 cup rice vinegar  1 teaspoon sugar  1/4 teaspoon cinnamon  3 tablespoons julienned mint leaves  1/3 cup toasted pine nuts  Salt and freshly ground white pepper  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin.  1.  Heat oven to 250 degrees. Quarter six tomatoes. Scoop out pulp and seeds and reserve, leaving only flesh attached to skin. Place wedges skin-side down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Slice 2 garlic cloves and scatter on tomatoes, along with leaves from 1 sprig thyme. Place in oven and roast 2 hours. Meanwhile, discard seeds from reserved tomato pulp. Peel and seed remaining tomatoes. Finely chop all. Mince remaining garlic clove.  2.  Heat  1/4 cup olive oil in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Add onion and remaining garlic and saut\u00e9 over low heat until soft, about 20 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, remaining thyme and the bay leaf and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until all liquid has evaporated and mixture barely begins to brown, about 2 hours. Remove from heat and let cool. Remove bay leaf and thyme sprig.  3.  When tomato wedges have finished roasting, remove from oven, scrape off and discard skin and set wedges aside to cool.  4.  Mix sushi rice in a small saucepan with 1 1/4 cups water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook 15 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Place currants in a dish with rum.  5.  Transfer rice to a bowl and mix in vinegar, sugar and cinnamon. Press cooked tomato and onion mixture in a sieve to remove excess oil. Discard oil and fold tomato mixture into rice. Fold in mint, currants with rum and pine nuts. Season with salt and pepper. Let sit for 30 minutes.  6.  Form rice mixture into 24 ovals, using a scant tablespoon for each. Arrange on a platter. Place a piece of roasted tomato on each oval, like fish on sushi. Brush tomatoes with a little oil, sprinkle each with a few grains of cumin and serve.  Yield: 6 servings.  Timbale of Skate  Adapted from Mavrikos Restaurant, Rhodes, Greece  Time: 1 hour, plus 1 hour's chilling  2 skate wings with cartilage, 1 pound each, or 24 ounces lump crab meat  1 cup extra virgin olive oil, if using skate, plus 2 tablespoons for serving  1/3 cup white wine vinegar, if using skate  Juice and grated zest of  1/2 orange  Juice of 1 lemon  2 tablespoons pine nuts  1 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley  1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves  1 teaspoon capers  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 cup red wine vinegar  1/4 cup aged balsamic vinegar  1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar  1 small strip orange peel  3 black peppercorns  Lemon wedges for serving.  1.  Place skate in a saucepan with olive oil and white wine vinegar. Fish should be just about covered. Bring to a simmer and cook on low heat 30 minutes. Let cool in oil. Remove flesh from cartilage and place in a bowl. Fish will become somewhat shredded. If using crab meat instead, place in a bowl.  2.  Blend orange juice and zest, lemon juice, pine nuts, parsley, cilantro and capers in a blender until smooth. Fold into fish or crab meat. Season with salt and pepper. Pack some fish or crab meat into a 4-ounce mold (a  1/2-cup metal measuring cup works fine) and unmold onto a platter. Repeat with remaining fish or crab meat to make 6 timbales. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.  3.  Meanwhile, bring red wine vinegar, balsamic, brown sugar, orange peel and peppercorns to a boil in a small saucepan. Cook until reduced by half and syrupy. Let cool.  4.  To serve, transfer timbales to individual plates and drizzle a little olive oil on each. Spoon a little syrup on plate around each, garnish with lemon wedges. Serve.  Yield: 6 servings.  ",

                    "text": "  The Indianapolis Colts, the team of Peyton Manning and the franchise that once had the legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas, probably never thought they would rely on a formula like this to win in the playoffs: Let the defense stop the opponent, have the place-kicker score all the points, and hope the offense does not make too many mistakes.  Who did they think they were -- the Baltimore Ravens? The Ravens, the team that brought football back to Baltimore, patented that game plan when they won the Super Bowl in 2001. But the Colts borrowed a page from that playbook Saturday, beating the Ravens, 15-6, to advance to next Sunday's American Football Conference championship game.  The Colts, for years the N.F.L.'s most dazzling offense, won in the most unexpected fashion -- without scoring a touchdown and by allowing fewer than 10 points for the second time in the playoffs. They have made their way through the playoffs without the white-hot spotlight and the staggering weight of outside expectations bearing down on them. Manning, whose postseason struggles have threatened to blemish his career r\u00e9sum\u00e9, has thrown five interceptions and only one touchdown pass in the past two games.  But if the New England Patriots defeat the San Diego Chargers in Sunday's A.F.C. playoff game, the Colts will play host to the championship game -- a perk they were supposed to enjoy last year, when they were the overwhelming favorite to reach the Super Bowl.  In the waning moments of the victory, after Adam Vinatieri had nailed his fifth field goal, Colts Coach Tony Dungy stood beside defensive tackle Anthony McFarland. Dungy and McFarland had been together in Tampa Bay, too, when the Buccaneers' repeated playoff runs were foiled by a terrible offense. The Bucs fired Dungy for his failure to win a title and he was quickly hired by the Colts, who hoped he would build a defense that would be a complement to Manning's offense.  With two smothering defensive efforts in the playoffs so far, Dungy seems to be fulfilling his mandate at precisely the moment when Manning has stumbled. So, on the sideline, Dungy and McFarland christened the Colts' victory: Call it Buc-ball.  ''We won a lot of games like this,'' Dungy said of his Buccaneers. ''We were having a laugh. These guys are all nervous. Every game we won, we won like this. It's Ravens ball. We outplayed them at their game.''  Actually, the Ravens have never had a quarterback like Manning. But the arrival of quarterback Steve McNair, who once shared league most valuable player honors with Manning, energized the offense and created a balance with the defense that propelled the Ravens to the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C.  But on Saturday both offenses were virtually beside the point. This was just the fourth time in N.F.L. history, and the first since 1979, that neither team scored a touchdown in a playoff game. The Ravens had the best defense in the league this season, but Manning said he could not recall, in his nine seasons in the N.F.L., ever winning a game without scoring at least one touchdown.  Except for the outcome, this was a forgettable performance for him. Scrambling to avoid pressure, Manning frequently overthrew his receivers. He was intercepted twice while completing only 15 of 30 pass attempts, statistically an even worse day than McNair had, with his two interceptions and 18-of-29 passing. Manning's 39.6 quarterback rating was nearly as bad as the 35.5 rating he posted when the Patriots battered the Colts in the 2005 A.F.C. championship game.  ''The plan coming in was to score touchdowns,'' Manning said, laughing. ''We were not planning to score 35 points, but we thought maybe 20 points. I knew it would be tough sledding.''  But Manning completed the most important pass of the game, in the middle of a clock-chewing fourth-quarter drive that kept the ball out of the Ravens' hands when they were trailing by only 6 points. On third-and-5 from Baltimore's 45, Manning zipped a pass to tight end Dallas Clark, who was blanketed by Ravens cornerback Corey Ivy.  At the most critical moment, the Ravens' defense could not make a stop. The Colts' defense, particularly against the run, was shredded for most of the regular season, but with the return of safety Bob Sanders from an injury that forced him to miss almost all of the regular season, the Colts have had consecutive lockdown performances. They held the Chiefs' Larry Johnson to 32 yards rushing last week, then held the Ravens to 83. They thwarted Baltimore's preferred style to get an early lead and then unleashed blitzes.  The Ravens never had the lead because the Colts had the one weapon they lacked last season: a reliable field-goal kicker. The Colts signed Vinatieri away from the Patriots expressly for games like this.  Last season ended for the Colts when Mike Vanderjagt badly missed a field goal in the divisional round. The league's most dynamic offense, and the improving defense, could do nothing to replace those 3 points, so the Colts replaced Vanderjagt as soon as free agency started with Vinatieri, one of the most clutch kickers in N.F.L. history.  Vinatieri has had plenty of highlight-reel moments, none more memorable than his successful field goals in a blizzard against the Oakland Raiders that propelled the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title. But if the Colts go to the Super Bowl, Vinatieri might have provided an omen to their postseason.  His third field goal of the game, late in the second quarter, was a 51-yarder. He did not hit it well and the ball seemed to die as it got near the goal post. It barely hit the cross bar and with its last bit of momentum, it bounced over.  It was not pretty, but it got through. Just like the Colts.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Warsaw's new archbishop, Stanislaw W. Wielgus, caught in Eastern Europe's widening witch hunt for former Communist secret police informers, admitted Friday that he had collaborated with the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, known as the S.B.  ''Before you today, I confess to the mistake committed by me years ago, just as I have confessed to the Holy Father,'' Bishop Wielgus said in an open letter to Polish Catholics. ''By the fact of this entanglement, I have damaged the church.''  He said he compounded that damage by denying ''facts of this cooperation'' in recent days.  Bishop Wielgus insisted, however, that he had neither spied on anyone nor harmed anyone. He said the only thing he ever did was to inform the secret police of his agenda during foreign academic meetings and to promise not to take part in anti-Communist activities.  He said it was up to Pope Benedict XVI to decide whether he would keep his new job, which he took up Friday.  The bishop is to be officially elevated to archbishop during a ceremony on Sunday in Warsaw at St. John's Cathedral, though many voices in Poland have called for him to step down.  The Warsaw archbishopric is a particularly symbolic institution in the former Soviet bloc. The Polish church, together with the Polish-born Pope John Paul II, were crucial supporters of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement, which helped bring down the totalitarian system and end the cold war.  Confirmation that the archbishop collaborated is doubly troubling because the Polish secret police murdered a charismatic anti-Communist priest from the archdiocese, the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, in 1984. Warsaw's departing archbishop, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, waged a quiet battle with the Communist Party in those years.  Many historians argue that a significant segment of the clergy in Poland and other Eastern bloc countries collaborated to varying degrees with the secret services. Priests have recently been added to those segments of society under scrutiny in several countries during recent efforts to expose former Communist collaborators.  Two years ago, files surfaced showing that the Rev. Mieczyslaw Malinski, who had been close to John Paul II, worked for the S.B. in the 1980s. Several other prominent priests have since been accused of having been informers, and some have admitted that they had links to the secret police. The Polish church publicly apologized last year for priests who collaborated with the S.B., but has tried to keep their names secret.  The uproar over Bishop Wielgus's past began shortly after Pope Benedict picked him in early December to succeed Cardinal Glemp as Warsaw's archbishop. A Polish daily newspaper, Gazeta Polska, reported Dec. 20 that the bishop, 67, had spied on dissidents and fellow clerics for more than two decades, until Communism collapsed in 1989.  Both Bishop Wielgus and the Vatican sought to deflect the accusations by saying his involvement with the secret police had been nothing out of the ordinary for people traveling abroad during the Communist era. Leading representatives of the Polish clergy denounced the accusations against him.  But Poland's human rights ombudsman, Janusz Kochanowski, said Thursday that there was evidence in the secret police archives that Bishop Wielgus had knowingly cooperated with Communist authorities. Rzeczpospolita, one of Poland's most respected newspapers, published documents showing that he had met with police agents more than 50 times in one five-year period.  Even Poland's Catholic Church Historical Commission issued a statement on Friday, saying, ''There are numerous, substantial documents confirming Stanislaw Wielgus's willingness for a conscious and secret cooperation with the Communist security forces.''  The commission said that there was no evidence that Bishop Wielgus's actions harmed anyone, and that the documents would be sent to the Vatican for further study.  Monsignor Wielgus first admitted Friday that he had signed a cooperation statement with the secret police in 1978 under pressure by a ''brutal intelligence officer'' when he was seeking permission to travel to Munich. ''That was my moment of weakness,'' he wrote.  But he accused the secret police of falsifying documents that cast him as a more eager, useful collaborator than he actually was.  ''The personality ascribed to me in the intelligence service documents is so far from the truth that I would never have recognized myself,'' he wrote.  Those claims are not far-fetched. Almost from the moment the Iron Curtain fell, the nations of the former Communist bloc have been steeped in controversies over the files of their secret police forces. The documents are often elliptical and incomplete, and were sometimes embellished by secret police officers eager to impress their superiors, experts say.  The documents published by Rzeczpospolita and other newspapers suggest that Bishop Wielgus was recruited by the S.B. in 1967 when he was a philosophy student at the University of Lublin in eastern Poland, more than a decade before he signed the cooperation agreement. Newspapers cited other documents in which the S.B. claimed he had given them information about activities at the university, where he later served as a professor of medieval philosophy.  The newspapers claimed that some documents referred to Bishop Wielgus by the code names Grey, Adam and Adam Wysocki. They said he received training and was rewarded for his collaboration with a grant to study in Munich.  Later Friday, Bishop Wielgus issued another statement, which was broadcast by Vatican Radio's Polish service, in which he said he had collaborated so that he could travel abroad for his academic research.  ''I'm not trying to justify anything, I know that I shouldn't have had any relations with the Communist regime's secret services,'' he said. ''At the time I thought I had to continue my important scientific research and acquire sound training for the good of the church.''  The Vatican has continued to support the embattled prelate.  ''The Holy See, in deciding the nomination of the new archbishop of Warsaw, took into consideration all the circumstances of his life, including those regarding his past,'' the Vatican said in a statement on Friday, repeating the position it has taken for the past month.  The statement said Benedict ''has every confidence in Bishop Stanislaw Wielgus and in full conscience entrusted him the mission of pastor of the archdiocese of Warsaw.''  ",

The kitchen at Agata & Valentina, 1505 First Avenue (79th Street), is preparing preserved lemons, but with a bright, palate-pleasing departure from the salt-cured Moroccan recipe. It uses Meyer lemons, which are sweeter than regular lemons, and cures them not just with salt but also with a touch of sugar, then bathes them in olive oil.  The resulting wedges can be served as a condiment alongside grilled fish or chicken. The salt does not have to be rinsed off and the flesh and the tender peel can be eaten. The lemons are also excellent tucked into the cavity of a whole fish before roasting. Refrigerate them but bring them to room temperature for about 30 minutes before using, so the oil can liquefy. They are $6.99 for 15 ounces.  FOOD STUFF  ",

                    "text": "  The mithai, or Indian sweets, at Bengali Sweet House in Iselin are sublime in their simplicity. Although many of the classic sweets sold here are made from a short list of ingredients -- mainly milk -- the resulting variety of good things to taste is astounding.  The sweets at Bengali Sweet House represent various regions of India, but to try some of the best, order those typical of Bengal, which is known for its confections. The mix includes cheeselike sandesh, rosogolla treats that ooze milk, and creamy white and pink cham-cham, shaped like cumulus clouds. The beautiful yellow hue of the aam sandesh signals its mango flavor. It tastes as good as it looks. All these sweets are $9 a pound.  Ghee, or clarified butter, and mawa, or dried condensed milk, are two essential ingredients in Indian sweets, and Bengali Sweet House makes both in house. The homemade quality is evident, especially in the gulab jaman, milk balls fried in ghee with cardamom, and in the fudgelike burfi (an assortment, $8 a pound). There are chocolate, coconut and pistachio burfi ($7 to $8 a pound). The dried fruit sweets, including the badam pista roll with almonds and pistachio, are also good ($9 a pound).  Aside from sweets, Bengali Sweet House also sells a variety of chaat, or Indian snacks, including fresh fried samosas, filled with potatoes and peas (60 cents apiece). There is also a good selection of spiced cashews and peanuts.  The Jain family, who hail from a long line of halwai, or sweet makers, in northern India, opened Bengali Sweet House in Iselin in 1998. A Jersey City location followed in 2002.  Bengali Sweet House, 1384B Oak Tree Road, Iselin; (732) 404-1700; 836 Newark Avenue, Jersey City; (201) 798-9241;  www.bengalisweet.com.

                    "text": "  As fighting began to flare Sunday around Kismayo, in southern Somalia, the final redoubt for the country's diminished Islamic movement, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.  Muhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.  ''We told them that they were going to lose,'' Mr. Arab said, ''and that our city would get destroyed.''  Kismayo, a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the East African spice empire, has been spared the fighting so far. But the Islamists, Mr. Arab said, did not care. ''These guys are bent on war,'' he said.  The fighting started around 5 p.m., with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib, a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo.  [Residents of Kismayo told Reuters Monday that Somali Islamists fled overnight from their final stronghold around the southern port of the city. Several thousand Somalia Islamic Courts Council fighters had been making a last stand north of Kismayo port, but residents said they melted away after the advancing Ethiopian force began its shelling of Jilib. Somalia's interim government vowed to pursue them.]  As the shells began to rain down in Jilib, residents said, clan militias in Kismayo turned on the Islamists.  That set off running gun battles across the city, with several people reported killed. It also accelerated the exodus from Kismayo, with thousands of residents hastily gathering a few belongings and joining the stream of people fleeing the fighting in southern Somalia.  It is hard to predict what is going to happen next. Local support for the Islamists in Kismayo is obviously evaporating, just as it did last week in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, when clan elders decided that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.  That led to the city falling much faster than anyone expected into the hands of Somalia's transitional government, which has used Ethiopian troops and airpower to reclaim much of the country. Clan elders are the pillars of Somali society, and many of the Islamist fighters in Mogadishu were clan militiamen lent to the movement.  But the fighters in Kismayo may be different. Kismayo is where the Islamist leadership fled after losing Mogadishu, taking their most steadfast and hard-core fighters.  Ethiopian officials have said that the Somali Islamists are bolstered by several thousand foreign fighters -- from Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Libya and Eritrea, Ethiopia's bitter enemy, though American intelligence officials have said that the numbers are far fewer, most likely in the hundreds.  Diplomats are still searching for a way to avert disaster. On Sunday, Kenyan officials, with American encouragement, continued to meet in Nairobi with the few remaining moderate leaders of the Islamist movement in an effort to reach a cease-fire. But the talks were slow-going, said an official close to the parties.  In Mogadishu, the transitional prime minister, Ali Mohammed Gedi, seems to relish his newfound authority. Mr. Gedi, a bookish veterinarian whom few Somalis would have recognized before last week's stunning comeback by the transitional government, is holding daily news conferences, meeting with clan elders and surveying bombed-out buildings for future office space. On Sunday, he reassured the populace in confident tones that the era of warlord rule was over.  ",

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''Bumping in Schools'' (editorial, Dec. 27):  As a veteran teacher in private schools, I was delighted when the school district in Philadelphia negotiated to allow some schools to practice on-site selection of teachers instead of the seniority placement system described in your editorial.  What had kept me out of public urban education was the prospect of teaching at a school whose faculty and administration were not reform-minded. I wanted my efforts to be supported, but under the seniority-based system of placement, my desire to be part of positive change was irrelevant.  Why would a well-meaning principal try to be a reformer? He or she would have no hand in selecting the faculty.  I now work with like-minded colleagues and administrators in a Philadelphia public school, but it was possible only when an alternative to the seniority-based placement system was created.  Matthew C. Baird  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  To the Editor:  Finding teachers for the neediest classrooms is a challenge for many school districts.  Regrettably, and all too often, assignments to these positions are seen as the ''dues'' new teachers must pay before they can work their way through the system and transfer to schools considered to be more desirable.  One way to curb this trend would be to limit the percentage of novice teachers that can be assigned to high-needs schools and to provide a higher level of support for beginning teachers in these positions.  It would also help if schools serving the neediest children were directed by experienced and highly qualified administrators.  Howard Miller  Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is an associate professor of literacy education at Mercy College.  To the Editor:  The ''bumping'' process that you describe is bogus.  The seniority rule regarding assignment to a school is: if a vacancy occurs, it is filled by seniority. Even this procedure has been watered down by the site-selection process, in which teachers must interview for a vacant position and seniority plays no part.  The idea that teachers change schools willy-nilly at their own choice is a myth.  John Jaros  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is a teacher.  ",

                    "text": "  A recent series of American raids against Iranians in Iraq was authorized under an order that President Bush decided to issue several months ago to undertake a broad military offensive against Iranian operatives in the country, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday.  ''There has been a decision to go after these networks,'' Ms. Rice said in an interview with The New York Times in her office on Friday afternoon, before leaving on a trip to the Middle East.  Ms. Rice said Mr. Bush had acted ''after a period of time in which we saw increasing activity'' among Iranians in Iraq, ''and increasing lethality in what they were producing.'' She was referring to what American military officials say is evidence that many of the most sophisticated improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.'s, being used against American troops were made in Iran.  Ms. Rice was vague on the question of when Mr. Bush issued the order, but said his decision grew out of questions that the president and members of his National Security Council raised in the fall.  The administration has long accused Iran of meddling in Iraq, providing weapons and training to Shiite forces with the idea of keeping the United States bogged down in the war. Ms. Rice's willingness to discuss the issue seemed to reflect a new hostility to Iran that was first evident in Mr. Bush's speech to the nation on Wednesday night, in which he accused Tehran of providing material support for attacks on American troops and vowed to respond.  Until now, despite a series of raids in which Iranians have been seized by American forces in Baghdad and other cities in Iraq, administration officials have declined to say whether Mr. Bush ordered such actions.  The White House decision to authorize the aggressive steps against Iranians in Iraq appears to formalize the American effort to contain Iran's ambitions as a new front in the Iraq war. Administration officials now describe Iran as the single greatest threat the United States faces in the Middle East, though some administration critics regard the talk about Iran as a diversion, one intended to shift attention away from the spiraling chaos in Iraq.  In adopting a more confrontational approach toward Iran, Mr. Bush has decisively rejected recommendations of the Iraq Study Group that he explore negotiations with Tehran as part of a new strategy to help quell the sectarian violence in Iraq.  In the interview on Friday, Ms. Rice described the military effort against Iranians in Iraq as a defensive ''force protection mission,'' but said it was also motivated by concerns that Iran was trying to further destabilize the country.  Mr. Bush's public warning to Iran was accompanied by the deployment of an additional aircraft carrier off Iran's coast and advanced Patriot antimissile defense systems in Persian Gulf countries near Iran's borders. Both the White House and the secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, insisted Friday that the United States was not seeking to goad Iran into conflict, and that it had no intention of taking the battle into Iranian territory. The White House spokesman, Tony Snow, warned reporters away from ''an urban legend that's going around'' that Mr. Bush was ''trying to prepare the way for war'' with Iran or Syria.  Mr. Gates said that the United States did not intend to engage in hot pursuit of the operatives into Iran.  ''We believe that we can interrupt these networks that are providing support, through actions inside the territory of Iraq, that there is no need to attack targets in Iran itself,'' Mr. Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ''I continue to believe what I told you at the confirmation hearing,'' he added, referring to last month's hearings on his nomination, ''that any kind of military action inside Iran itself would be a very last resort.''  Ms. Rice's comments came just a day after the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, issued a sharp warning to the administration about the recent raids against Iranians in Iraq, including one in Erbil early Thursday.  He said the vote to authorize the president to order the use of force to topple Saddam Hussein was not a vehicle for mounting attacks in Iran, even to pursue cells or networks assisting insurgents or sectarian militias. ''I just want the record to show -- and I would like to have a legal response from the State Department if they think they have authority to pursue networks or anything else across the border into Iran and Iraq -- that will generate a constitutional confrontation here in the Senate, I predict to you,'' Mr. Biden said.  In the view of American officials, Iran is engaged in a policy of ''managed chaos'' in Iraq. Its presumed goal, both policymakers and intelligence officials say, is to raise the cost to the United States for its intervention in Iraq, in hopes of teaching Washington a painful lesson about the perils of engaging in regime change.  Toward this end, American officials charge, Iran has provided components, including explosives and infrared triggering devices, for sophisticated roadside bombs that are designed to penetrate armor. They have also provided training for several thousand Shiite militia fighters, mostly in Iran. Officials say the training is carried out by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security.  In the interview on Friday, Ms. Rice said, ''We think they are providing help to the militias as well, and maybe even the more violent element of these militias.''  In addition, American officials say the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds Force is active in Iraq. A senior military official said last week that one of the Iranians seized in Baghdad late last month was the No. 3 Quds official. He said American forces uncovered maps of neighborhoods in Baghdad in which Sunnis could be evicted, and evidence of involvement in the war during the summer in Lebanon.  That Iranian official was ordered released, by Ms. Rice among others, after Iran claimed he had diplomatic status.  This week, American forces in Iraq conducted at least two raids against suspected Iranian operatives, including the raid in Erbil. The United States is currently detaining several individuals with Iranian passports who were picked up in those raids. The Iranians have said that they were in the process of establishing a consulate, but American officials said that the Erbil operation was a liaison office and that the workers there did not have diplomatic passports.  A defense official said Friday that such raids would continue. ''We are going to be more aggressive,'' he said, referring to the suspected Iranian operatives. ''We are going to look for them and to try to do what we can to get them into custody.''  THE REACH OF WAR  ",

                    "text": "  For more than two years after Saddam Hussein's fall, the war in Iraq was about chasing down insurgents and Al Qaeda in Iraq. Last year it expanded to tamping down sectarian warfare.  Over the past three weeks, in two sets of raids and newly disclosed orders issued by President Bush, a third front has opened -- against Iran.  Administration officials say the goal is limited to preventing Iranians from aiding in attacks on American and Iraqi forces inside Iraq. But in recent interviews and public statements, senior members of the Bush administration have made it clear that their agenda goes significantly further, toward foiling Iran's dream of emerging as the greatest power in the Middle East.  In an interview on Friday, before she left on her latest Middle East trip, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described what she called an ''evolving'' strategy to confront ''destabilizing behavior'' by Iran across the region. Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said Sunday on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' that the United States was resisting an Iranian effort ''to basically establish hegemony'' throughout the region.  Even some of Mr. Bush's fiercest critics do not question that the administration's conviction that Iran's ambitions are large is correct. A few midlevel administration officials wondered even in 2003 whether Iran was a far more potent threat than Mr. Hussein.  Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, administration officials argued that deposing Mr. Hussein would send a powerful signal to Iran and North Korea, the two countries that Mr. Bush identified along with Iraq in his 2002 State of the Union address as part of an ''axis of evil.''  ''You heard this argument in meetings all the time,'' a senior official on the National Security Council, who has since left the administration, recalled recently. ''Iraq would make the harder problems of Iran and North Korea easier.''  But the opposite happened. North Korea tested a nuclear device in October. And Iran has sped ahead with a uranium enrichment program.  Now, despite the urging of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to engage with Iran, Washington is moving in a more confrontational direction. It is stationing more naval, air and antimissile batteries off Iran's coast; has persuaded many international businesses to cut off dealings with Iran; and it has interfered with Iranians inside Iraqi territory.  ''The administration does have Iran on the brain, and I think they are exaggerating the amount of Iranian activities in Iraq,'' Kenneth M. Pollack, the director of research at the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution, said Sunday. ''There's a good chance that this is going to be counterproductive -- that this is a way to get into a spiral with Iran that leads you into conflict. The likely response from the Iranians is that they are going to want to demonstrate to us that they are not going to be pushed around.''  Administration officials say ignoring Iran's activities will only lead to escalation with the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ''There's no question that everything that has gone wrong in Iraq has made life easier for the Iranians,'' one senior White House official said recently. ''The question is what you do about that.''  The answer, shaped in the National Security Council, is for the American military to make targets of Iranians whom they believe are fueling attacks, a decision that Mr. Bush made months ago that was disclosed only last week.  At least twice in the last month, in raids in Iraq that have infuriated officials there, American soldiers have detained Iranians. On Sunday, Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, called for the release of five Iranians taken in the most recent raid, which occurred early on Thursday in Erbil. On CNN's ''Late Edition,'' he said that while the five were members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the group ''in fact is part of the Iranian political system.''  The potential strategic split with the Iraqi government over how to handle the Iranians is only one of the questions raised by Washington's new approach. First among them is whether the effort will stop at Iran's borders. In Congressional testimony, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates has said that he sees no need to enter Iranian territory.  Yet American officials have been careful not to rule out the possibility of American actions inside Iran. Pressed on the ABC News program ''This Week'' on Sunday about excluding the option of going after Iranians inside Iran, Mr. Hadley said that for now, Iraq was ''the best place'' for the United States to take on the Iranians.  ''So, you don't believe you have the authority to go into Iran?'' the host, George Stephanopoulos, asked.  ''I didn't say that,'' Mr. Hadley responded. ''This is another issue. Any time you have questions about crossing international borders, there are legal issues.''  A second question is whether Mr. Bush will step up covert as well as overt efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program. So far, the evidence collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency suggests that Iran's nuclear efforts have run into technical obstacles, but concerns remain that inspectors are missing secret facilities. A third question is what Washington would do if the Iranians looked for ways to strike back.  Escalating tensions are the fear of American allies in the region, who worry about Iran, but worry more about provoking it.  On Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney argued that America's actions were intended to protect allies in the Persian Gulf -- though it is far from clear that Iran's Sunni Arab neighbors have signed on to the strategy. ''If you go and talk with the gulf states or if you talk with the Saudis or if you talk about the Israelis or the Jordanians, the entire region is worried,'' Mr. Cheney said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' He described how the Iranians ''sit astride the Straits of Hormuz'' and its oil-shipping channels, and how they support Hamas and Hezbollah.  ''So the threat that Iran represents is growing,'' he said, in words reminiscent of how he once built a case against Mr. Hussein. ''It's multidimensional, and it is, in fact, of concern to everybody in the region.''  THE REACH OF WAR: NEWS ANALYSIS  ",

The Maine lobster season is year-round, but Canadian lobstermen with far fewer traps have similar catches with a 180-day season, said the authors of the study, published in the journal Current Biology. They said Canadian lobster boats also had lower costs for fuel and bait. The executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association told The Associated Press that almost all traps were set in waters not frequented by the whales.  ANDREW C. REVKIN  ",

But they were faced with counterpoint arguments not only from Democrats but also from other Republicans. ''What I'll be doing is trying to appeal to my Republican colleagues to not pass a nonbinding resolution that basically says to the troops who are going there this is a mission that doesn't have a chance of succeeding,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS.  But on the same program, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said, ''I cannot support sending additional troops to Iraq.''  On ''This Week'' on ABC, Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said the resolutions were ''not helpful'' to the new American commander, Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, or ''to the troops, to the Iraqis.''  On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, a Republican presidential contender, said he was considering voting for a resolution criticizing the plan. That resolution also lays out benchmarks for the Iraqis to achieve and states that the Senate's intention is not to countermand the president's authority as commander in chief.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has passed a more harshly worded resolution criticizing the plan. Its backers include Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.  ",

                    "text": "  Flying over snow-capped peaks and into a thick fog, the helicopter set down on a barren strip of rocks between two glaciers. A dozen bags of supplies, a rifle and a can of cooking gas were tossed out onto the cold ground. Then, with engines whining, the helicopter lifted off, snow and fog swirling in the rotor wash.  When it had disappeared over the horizon, no sound remained but the howling of the Arctic wind.  ''It feels a little like the days of the old explorers, doesn't it?'' Dennis Schmitt said.  Mr. Schmitt, a 60-year-old explorer from Berkeley, Calif., had just landed on a newly revealed island 400 miles north of the Arctic Circle in eastern Greenland. It was a moment of triumph: he had discovered the island on an ocean voyage in September 2005. Now, a year later, he and a small expedition team had returned to spend a week climbing peaks, crossing treacherous glaciers and documenting animal and plant life.  Despite its remote location, the island would almost certainly have been discovered, named and mapped almost a century ago when explorers like Jean-Baptiste Charcot and Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, charted these coastlines. Would have been discovered had it not been bound to the coast by glacial ice.  Maps of the region show a mountainous peninsula covered with glaciers. The island's distinct shape -- like a hand with three bony fingers pointing north -- looks like the end of the peninsula.  Now, where the maps showed only ice, a band of fast-flowing seawater ran between a newly exposed shoreline and the aquamarine-blue walls of a retreating ice shelf. The water was littered with dozens of icebergs, some as large as half an acre; every hour or so, several more tons of ice fractured off the shelf with a thunderous crack and an earth-shaking rumble.  All over Greenland and the Arctic, rising temperatures are not simply melting ice; they are changing the very geography of coastlines. Nunataks -- ''lonely mountains'' in Inuit -- that were encased in the margins of Greenland's ice sheet are being freed of their age-old bonds, exposing a new chain of islands, and a new opportunity for Arctic explorers to write their names on the landscape.  ''We are already in a new era of geography,'' said the Arctic explorer Will Steger. ''This phenomenon -- of an island all of a sudden appearing out of nowhere and the ice melting around it -- is a real common phenomenon now.''  In August, Mr. Steger discovered his own new island off the coast of the Norwegian island of Svalbard, high in the polar basin. Glaciers that had surrounded it when his ship passed through only two years earlier were gone this year, leaving only a small island alone in the open ocean.  ''We saw it ourselves up there, just how fast the ice is going,'' he said.  With 27,555 miles of coastline and thousands of fjords, inlets, bays and straits, Greenland has always been hard to map. Now its geography is becoming obsolete almost as soon as new maps are created.  Hans Jepsen is a cartographer at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which produces topographical maps for mining and oil companies. (Greenland is a largely self-governing region of Denmark.) Last summer, he spotted several new islands in an area where a massive ice shelf had broken up. Mr. Jepsen was unaware of Mr. Schmitt's discovery, and an old aerial photograph in his files showed the peninsula intact.  ''Clearly, the new island was detached from the mainland when the connecting glacier-bridge retreated southward,'' Mr. Jepsen said, adding that future maps would take note of the change.  The sudden appearance of the islands is a symptom of an ice sheet going into retreat, scientists say. Greenland is covered by 630,000 cubic miles of ice, enough water to raise global sea levels by 23 feet.  Carl Egede Boggild, a professor of snow-and-ice physics at the University Center of Svalbard, said Greenland could be losing more than 80 cubic miles of ice per year.  ''That corresponds to three times the volume of all the glaciers in the Alps,'' Dr. Boggild said. ''If you lose that much volume you'd definitely see new islands appear.''  He discovered an island himself a year ago while flying over northwestern Greenland. ''Suddenly I saw an island with glacial ice on it,'' he said. ''I looked at the map and it should have been a nunatak, but the present ice margin was about 10 kilometers away. So I can say that within the last five years the ice margin had retreated at least 10 kilometers.''  The abrupt acceleration of melting in Greenland has taken climate scientists by surprise. Tidewater glaciers, which discharge ice into the oceans as they break up in the process called calving, have doubled and tripled in speed all over Greenland. Ice shelves are breaking up, and summertime ''glacial earthquakes'' have been detected within the ice sheet.  ''The general thinking until very recently was that ice sheets don't react very quickly to climate,'' said Martin Truffer, a glaciologist at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. ''But that thinking is changing right now, because we're seeing things that people have thought are impossible.''  A study in The Journal of Climate last June observed that Greenland had become the single largest contributor to global sea-level rise.  Until recently, the consensus of climate scientists was that the impact of melting polar ice sheets would be negligible over the next 100 years. Ice sheets were thought to be extremely slow in reacting to atmospheric warming. The 2001 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, widely considered to be an authoritative scientific statement on the potential impacts of global warming, based its conclusions about sea-level rise on a computer model that predicted a slow onset of melting in Greenland.  ''When you look at the ice sheet, the models didn't work, which puts us on shaky ground,'' said Richard Alley, a geosciences professor at Pennsylvania State University.  There is no consensus on how much Greenland's ice will melt in the near future, Dr. Alley said, and no computer model that can accurately predict the future of the ice sheet. Yet given the acceleration of tidewater-glacier melting, a sea-level rise of a foot or two in the coming decades is entirely possible, he said. That bodes ill for island nations and those who live near the coast.  ''Even a foot rise is a pretty horrible scenario,'' said Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University in Miami.  On low-lying and gently sloping land like coastal river deltas, a sea-level rise of just one foot would send water thousands of feet inland. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide make their homes in such deltas; virtually all of coastal Bangladesh lies in the delta of the Ganges River. Over the long term, much larger sea-level rises would render the world's coastlines unrecognizable, creating a whole new series of islands.  ''Here in Miami,'' Dr. Leatherman said, ''we're going to have an ocean on both sides of us.''  Such ominous implications are not lost on Mr. Schmitt, who says he hopes that the island he discovered in Greenland in September will become an international symbol of the effects of climate change. Mr. Schmitt, who speaks Inuit, has provisionally named it Uunartoq Qeqertoq: the warming island.  Global warming has profoundly altered the nature of polar exploration, said Mr. Schmitt, who in 40 years has logged more than 100 Arctic expeditions. Routes once pioneered on a dogsled are routinely paddled in a kayak now; many features, like the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf in Greenland's northwest, have disappeared for good.  ''There is a dark side to this,'' he said about the new island. ''We felt the exhilaration of discovery. We were exploring something new. But of course, there was also something scary about what we did there. We were looking in the face of these changes, and all of us were thinking of the dire consequences.''  Correction:  January 18, 2007, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times on Tuesday about the appearance of a new island as a result of glacial melting in Greenland referred incorrectly to a region where another such island has appeared. Svalbard, off Norway, is an archipelago, not an island.  ",

Who has ridden along New York's 656 miles of subway lines and not wondered: ''What if I fell to the tracks as a train came in? What would I do?''  And who has not thought: ''What if someone else fell? Would I jump to the rescue?''  Wesley Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker and Navy veteran, faced both those questions in a flashing instant yesterday, and got his answers almost as quickly.  Mr. Autrey was waiting for the downtown local at 137th Street and Broadway in Manhattan around 12:45 p.m. He was taking his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, home before work.  Nearby, a man collapsed, his body convulsing. Mr. Autrey and two women rushed to help, he said. The man, Cameron Hollopeter, 20, managed to get up, but then stumbled to the platform edge and fell to the tracks, between the two rails.  The headlights of the No. 1 train appeared. ''I had to make a split decision,'' Mr. Autrey said.  So he made one, and leapt.  Mr. Autrey lay on Mr. Hollopeter, his heart pounding, pressing him down in a space roughly a foot deep. The train's brakes screeched, but it could not stop in time.  Five cars rolled overhead before the train stopped, the cars passing inches from his head, smudging his blue knit cap with grease. Mr. Autrey heard onlookers' screams. ''We're O.K. down here,'' he yelled, ''but I've got two daughters up there. Let them know their father's O.K.'' He heard cries of wonder, and applause.  Power was cut, and workers got them out. Mr. Hollopeter, a student at the New York Film Academy, was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He had only bumps and bruises, said his grandfather, Jeff Friedman. The police said it appeared that Mr. Hollopeter had suffered a seizure.  Mr. Autrey refused medical help, because, he said, nothing was wrong. He did visit Mr. Hollopeter in the hospital before heading to his night shift. ''I don't feel like I did something spectacular; I just saw someone who needed help,'' Mr. Autrey said. ''I did what I felt was right.''  ",

                    "text": "  After a political dispute that shut down an important oil pipeline to Europe, Russia's prime minister, Mikhail Y. Fradkov, announced that Russia had agreed to lower significantly an export duty on oil to Belarus. Russia had imposed a duty of $180 per ton on oil shipped to Belarus, but agreed to lower it to $53 after the conflict prompted a halt in supplies to Europe through the Druzhba, or Friendship, pipeline, according to news accounts. Belarus on Wednesday agreed to drop a tit-for-tat fee it had imposed in response to Russia's new duty, causing Russia to close the pipeline. Belarus has refined subsidized Russian oil and resold it at significant profit. Belarus will continue to receive a subsidy, but Mr. Fradkov said the new agreement, which appeared to end the dispute between the countries, would still raise $1 billion for Russia.

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  Re ''Bumping in Schools'' (editorial, Dec. 27):  As a veteran teacher in private schools, I was delighted when the school district in Philadelphia negotiated to allow some schools to practice on-site selection of teachers instead of the seniority placement system described in your editorial.  What had kept me out of public urban education was the prospect of teaching at a school whose faculty and administration were not reform-minded. I wanted my efforts to be supported, but under the seniority-based system of placement, my desire to be part of positive change was irrelevant.  Why would a well-meaning principal try to be a reformer? He or she would have no hand in selecting the faculty.  I now work with like-minded colleagues and administrators in a Philadelphia public school, but it was possible only when an alternative to the seniority-based placement system was created.  Matthew C. Baird  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  To the Editor:  Finding teachers for the neediest classrooms is a challenge for many school districts.  Regrettably, and all too often, assignments to these positions are seen as the ''dues'' new teachers must pay before they can work their way through the system and transfer to schools considered to be more desirable.  One way to curb this trend would be to limit the percentage of novice teachers that can be assigned to high-needs schools and to provide a higher level of support for beginning teachers in these positions.  It would also help if schools serving the neediest children were directed by experienced and highly qualified administrators.  Howard Miller  Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is an associate professor of literacy education at Mercy College.  To the Editor:  The ''bumping'' process that you describe is bogus.  The seniority rule regarding assignment to a school is: if a vacancy occurs, it is filled by seniority. Even this procedure has been watered down by the site-selection process, in which teachers must interview for a vacant position and seniority plays no part.  The idea that teachers change schools willy-nilly at their own choice is a myth.  John Jaros  Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006  The writer is a teacher.  ",

                    "text": "  On a recent evening, Jose Hodges and his wife, Laticha, unpacked a cartful of groceries while their 1-year-old son slept in his crib in their Bronx apartment. The couple have not had many moments like this. When he was 16, Jose Hodges, who is now 24, left his home in the Bronx. He began hanging out with the wrong crowd, he said, and at the age of 19 was convicted of attempted arson for trying to set fire to a car.  He was placed on probation, and he returned to live with his mother, his three siblings, and his mother's longtime male companion. Mr. Hodges said there was friction between him and his mother's companion, so, after two months, he chose to leave again.  Despite a learning disability that made it difficult for him to read, Mr. Hodges had learned to read music in middle school. He was hired by Eugene Klymyshyn, a blind man, to read music and text to him. But because Mr. Hodges had trouble reading, Mr. Klymyshyn hired him instead to repair his audio equipment.  ''I could read notes, but as far as reading text, I would stumble over words and would have to spell it out for him. So the progress was slow,'' Mr. Hodges said.  He lived alternately at his mother's home and, for three months, in Mr. Klymyshyn's basement, even though Mr. Klymyshyn had warned him not to do so.  Laticha Hodges, 21, was raised by her grandmother in the Bronx since she was 5, when her mother, a former prostitute and crack addict, was murdered in Yonkers in 1990. She, too, was unhappy with her living arrangements. At the age of 6, she said, she was sexually molested by a relative. She said that a year later she was raped by two men, and that at the age of 14 she was gang-raped by four teenage boys.  Mrs. Hodges has received money from Supplemental Security Income, a federal cash-assistance program, since she was 5, because she has a learning disability, she said. However, she said, the money often went toward the rent.  ''I would be lucky if I got $20 out of my own check,'' Mrs. Hodges said.  When she was 16, she had a mental breakdown, and, she said, tried to poison everyone in the apartment -- her grandmother, her sister and her aunt -- by putting rubbing alcohol in their drinks. No one was seriously injured. Mrs. Hodges' grandmother took her to a counselor, who prescribed medication to regulate mood swings and anger.  She met Mr. Hodges in 2003, while he was secretly living in the basement of Mr. Klymyshyn's house, in the same Bronx neighborhood where she lived.  Mrs. Hodges said she had found her savior.  ''Jose was my rescue,'' she said. ''I found a way out when I met him.''  Mrs. Hodges asked her grandmother if he could move in with them. When she refused, Mrs. Hodges joined him in Mr. Klymyshyn's basement apartment. There was a problem: Mrs. Hodges snored, and the noise led to their discovery by Mr. Klymyshyn. He ordered them out, but they did not move far, sleeping under his front porch.  After what they said were many unsuccessful attempts at getting into shelters separately, they married on Valentine's Day 2005, making themselves eligible for a family shelter. Three weeks later, they were placed in the Parkview Hotel, a shelter in Manhattan.  In November 2005, Mrs. Hodges gave birth to their son, Anthony, and the family was relocated to Help Morris, a shelter in the Bronx.  A week after Anthony was born, he became ill. After he vomited and had diarrhea for a day, the Hodgeses called Anthony's pediatrician, who advised them to change the baby's formula. But he got no better and they took him to Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He was given a blood transfusion because he was so dehydrated that his blood was not circulating properly, Mrs. Hodges said.  ''He was 6-14 when he came out, and he was 4-11 when he went in,'' she said, referring to her son's weight in pounds and ounces when he was born and when he was admitted to Montefiore.  Anthony remained hospitalized for four months for treatment of a blood clot in his leg and an enlarged vein in his head. Doctors told the Hodgeses that their son might have some developmental delays.  A social worker at Help Morris helped the Hodges to get an apartment. Because they did not have a mattress, however, they had to spend one last night at the shelter, and, they said, that night they were robbed of all their possessions.  ''I'm a video game collector, and they took all my classic stuff,'' Mr. Hodges said. ''But oh, man, the feeling was amazing, when I got the keys to my apartment.''  Montefiore referred the couple to Enock Mensah, a caseworker at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Queens, who in turn referred them to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  The federation used $800 from the Neediest Cases to buy a crib for Anthony, and a mattress and headboard for the Hodgeses.  Mrs. Hodges, who receives counseling four times a month, said her $640 Supplemental Security Income check covers the family's household essentials. Mr. Hodges, who is unemployed, is determined to find a job, ideally as an artist. He is good at sketching layouts and blueprints.  ''I just want to be able to provide for my son and his education,'' he said.

                    "text": "  Electrolux's Intensity upright vacuum is the latest entry in the fierce suction wars. Randall Sandlin, the company's director of industrial design, says the new vacuum has a three-inch gap between the nozzle and the dust bag -- unlike many uprights that have coiling hoses as long as three feet -- which results in better suction because the dirt has a shorter distance to travel. ''Think about it this way,'' he said. ''It's easier to drink through a straw than a garden hose.'' The Electrolux is also compact. It folds down for easy storage and weighs 16 pounds, less than most family dogs. It will be available later this month at Lowe's (lowes.com) for $299.99.

In this case, Ms. Dowd entertains the idea that ''genetic and political coding,'' rather than choice or free will, might account for the president's decisions regarding Iraq. She thereby not only takes Mr. Bush off the hook for his disastrous decisions and policies, but also implies that her longstanding critiques of this president are merely predetermined by her genetic coding rather than arising from rational analysis.  Of course, there is not much reason to publish this letter since its content is predetermined by my genetic coding -- unless I have the good fortune that ''the Decider'' of letters to the editor is predetermined to accept it.

                    "text": "  At the Final Four in Boston last April, the North Carolina women's basketball team saw a night full of promise dissolve into a disquieting mess.  The top-seeded Tar Heels lost in a semifinal to Maryland, which went on to win the national championship against Duke. North Carolina guard Ivory Latta said the flight home was filled with quiet tears.  Weeks and months passed, and Latta refused to watch the film from that game.  But on Friday, as the undefeated Tar Heels prepared for Sunday's game against Maryland, North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell figured the time was right. Her players sat and stomached last season's end.  ''Man, it was depressing,'' Latta said. ''It was very hard to watch.''  But Latta said the film was also helpful. The players noticed simple mistakes they had made and vowed not to repeat them. At the Comcast Center on Sunday, the second-ranked Tar Heels took their long-awaited shot at the No. 3 Terrapins. This time, they walked off the court delighted, with an 84-71 victory that snapped Maryland's 19-game home winning streak before a crowd of 17,950 that was the largest to attend an Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season women's game.  ''Playing against North Carolina, playing against Duke, the revenge factor is so, so big right now,'' said Maryland forward Laura Harper, whose team lost to Duke, 81-62, on Jan. 13. ''They come ready to play us.''  For a time, North Carolina's victory looked as if it would come easily. The Tar Heels (23-0, 7-0) raced to a 20-point second-half lead behind the shooting of Latta, who made six 3-pointers and finished with 32 points.  But Maryland (21-2, 5-2) responded with a furious comeback that was led by the senior guard Shay Doron, who scored 13 of her 19 points in the second half. With 3 minutes 13 seconds left, Doron converted a 15-footer, pulling the Terrapins to 67-66.  ''She just kept putting them up, making shots and all,'' Hatchell said. ''But, you know, that's Maryland; I knew they could score like that.''  The Tar Heels, who entered the game as the nation's top-scoring team, can pounce quickly, too. They closed the game with a 17-5 run, and revenge was theirs.  When Maryland, Duke and North Carolina reached the Final Four last season, it was the first time a conference had placed three teams in the national semifinals; the A.C.C. had never sent more than one.  This season, the three A.C.C. powers have a combined record of 65-2, with the two losses coming within their impressive triumvirate. Maryland plays host to Duke on Feb. 18 but will not face North Carolina again in the regular season. North Carolina plays host to Duke on Feb. 8 before visiting the Blue Devils on Feb. 25.  Sunday's game became a sellout more than two weeks ago. The atmosphere and the national-television audience might have caused some early-game jitters for the Terrapins. Maryland missed 15 of its first 18 field-goal attempts and committed 10 turnovers in the first 10 minutes.  ''Anxiousness, nerves, whatever you want to call it,'' Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. ''But at the same time, we have played on the biggest stage before.''  With 30 seconds remaining in the first half and North Carolina leading, 33-27, Maryland guard Kristi Toliver was hounded by two defenders as she struggled to bring the ball across midcourt. Frese stomped the floor and yelled to a referee, frustrated that a foul had not been called. She received a technical foul, and Latta made both free throws, giving the Tar Heels an 8-point halftime lead. Latta made four 3-pointers in the first 4:50 of the second half, putting North Carolina ahead by 20.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  The Nets have won four of five games, they are back atop the Atlantic Division and Vince Carter scored 32 points against his former team.  The Nets (15-19) beat the Toronto Raptors, 101-86, at Continental Arena Tuesday night, and got a fine effort from Jason Kidd, who fell two rebounds short of a triple-double, with 10 points and 14 assists.  Earlier in the day, Kidd was the focus of events beyond the court after filing for divorce from his wife, Joumana. ''There are really no distractions,'' he said after the game. ''This is my job, this is my livelihood. So anything personal stays personal and anything that's related to my job stays within my job.''  The Nets moved a half game ahead of the Raptors (15-20) for first place in the Atlantic Division, in which all five teams have losing records.  When the season started last November, not too many people would have picked this game to be a division battle. The Nets have won four of the last five division titles, and the Raptors have a young team that has not accomplished much since Carter left Toronto more than two years ago.  But the Raptors have had some impressive performances against top-flight teams this season, including a 2-point loss to the Phoenix Suns last week. Their future could be bright in part because of their 7-foot rookie forward, Andrea Bargnani, who hit 4 of 7 shots from 3-point range and led the Raptors with 22 points.  Although Bargnani got his looks, the Nets held forward Chris Bosh, the Raptors' best player, to 12 points. Bosh was playing in only his fourth game after missing 12 with a bruised bone in his right foot. The Nets also held Toronto's starting point guard, T. J. Ford, scoreless on 0-for-8 shooting from the field.  Nets forward Mikki Moore, who scored 12 points and had 8 rebounds, said stopping Bosh was a team effort.  ''Everybody shrunk the floor,'' he said. ''We talked. We communicated.''  The all-around effort, especially on defense, has often been absent for the Nets this season, and it has been one of the biggest culprits in their lackadaisical start.  The Nets' fortitude was most evident in the way they sprang back from what could have been a game-changing run by the Raptors.  After the Nets took a 15-0 lead to start the game, the Raptors pulled ahead with a 22-2 run that spanned parts of the first and second quarters and lasted nearly eight minutes. The Nets missed 10 of 11 shots during the stretch and had 6 turnovers.  The Nets answered by giving up only 38 points in the second half. They paid more attention to Bargnani, the first pick in last year's draft, and held him to 6 points after halftime.  ''We're not exactly where we want to be,'' said Nets forward Richard Jefferson, who scored 21 points. ''We understand now that we've dug ourselves a hole. It's a matter now of playing above and beyond to get out of the hole. This was a step in the right direction.''  Carter seemed intent on setting the tone against the team he played with for more than six seasons. The last time the Nets played the Raptors in Toronto, Carter scored only 12 points in a Nets loss. He had 14 points in the first quarter Tuesday night.  Perhaps Carter came out with a message from the Nets power forward Cliff Robinson in mind. Before the game, Carter said, Robinson told the team that it needed to bounce back from a defeat, much the way it did last season. The Nets were coming off a loss to the Cavaliers in Cleveland on Saturday night.  ''By him saying that, it kind of put something in the minds of the guys who are here,'' Carter said. ''We really game out with guns blazing.''  REBOUNDS  Cliff Robinson did not play in the second half because of a back strain that he sustained while bending over earlier in the day. Robinson, who was playing in only his third game after a month and a half absence because of an injured left knee, said he should be ready for Thursday night's game against the Bulls.  The Nets' rookie power forward Josh Boone, who did not play Saturday night after incurring his third migraine headache in three months, said he would have a precautionary magnetic resonance imaging exam in a few weeks.

                    "text": "  WHEN the first mass-produced granola came on the market in the 1970's, it was greeted with a touch of disbelief by many of us, as in, ''how dare they?'' If ever there was a homegrown food it was granola. Yet nostalgia isn't the only reason we should honor its roots.  In fact, there are two good reasons for making your own granola. One: it tastes better. Two: it contains better ingredients.  I won't argue that it's faster than grabbing a bag off a store shelf. In fact it requires some attention, because to make oats crunchy you must toast them, carefully and for a while. Not that this is a big deal, but it can't be done in your sleep.  Into this base of rolled oats you can stir just about any dry ingredient imaginable: other grains, like flakes of rye or wheat; dried fruit (raisins are the fallback, but neither the only nor best choice); spices, from cinnamon to vanilla to nutmeg to cardamom; orange zest, crystallized ginger, peanut butter  even, dare I say it, chocolate chips. And of course, any nut or seed you can think of: I favor a combination of cashews, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds and pecans.  I always add coconut, a flavor I adore. And I insist that there is no better sweetener than grade B maple syrup. Honey is good too.  Look at the ingredient list here, then compare it to one on the side of a box of commercially made stuff. See if that isn't enough to get you to take a trip back in time, to when all granola was made at home.  Crunchy Granola  Time: 40 minutes  6 cups rolled oats (not quick-cooking or instant)  2 cups mixed nuts and seeds: sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, chopped walnuts, pecans, almonds or cashews.  1 cup dried unsweetened shredded coconut, optional  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste  Dash salt  1/2 to 1 cup honey or maple syrup, or to taste  1 cup raisins or chopped dried fruit, optional.  1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl, combine oats, nuts and seeds, coconut, cinnamon, salt and sweetener. Place on a sheet pan and put in oven. Bake for 30 minutes or a little longer, stirring occasionally. Mixture should brown evenly; the browner it gets without burning, the crunchier the granola will be.  2.  Remove pan from oven and add raisins or dried fruit. Cool on a rack, stirring once in a while until granola reaches room temperature. Transfer to a sealed container and store in refrigerator; it will keep indefinitely.  Yield: About 8 cups (at least 16 servings).  THE MINIMALIST  ",

This is particularly onerous for many retirees who frequently pay some 20 percent of their pension and Social Security income for property taxes, yet on the block where they live, a wealthier person with the same property assessment may pay only 5 percent of his income for property taxes.  Property taxes are regressive in that payments reflect property values rather than income, thus favoring the wealthy over the middle class and poor.  Reform will not occur through plans to reduce benefits for state employees because the prospect of labor unrest and political retribution in an election year will surely deter legislators from provoking a significant part of the electorate.  The fair and appropriate way to achieve property tax reform is to require those with the highest incomes to pay a higher state income tax and use that money to substantially finance education while reducing property taxes.

Scholars do not so much know the pronunciation of ancient languages as they extrapolate and guess. They have had more success with some languages than with others, said Emily Teeter, spokeswoman for the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, a major center for the study of the ancient Near East. For example, she said, Semitic languages like Babylonian and Akkadian are closely related to ancient Hebrew, providing solid clues about how the other ancient Semitic languages were vocalized.  For ancient Egyptian, the clues are sparser, primarily bilingual inscriptions like the Rosetta Stone. A name may appear in Egyptian and in another writing in pronounceable script, helping in recovering the sounds of certain words. However, the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone lack indications for vowel sounds.  Another set of clues comes from Coptic, still used in Egyptian Christian churches. Coptic is the latest form of ancient Egyptian, Ms. Teeter said, and is believed to preserve many of the ancient sounds. ''It is written in Greek letters, with vowels,'' she said, ''except that it was necessary to import a few signs from Egyptian for sounds that Greek didn't have.''  C. CLAIBORNE RAY  Q & A  ",

                    "text": "  After falling behind Google in Internet search and advertising, Yahoo is trying to remain No. 1 in the battle to deliver information and online services to mobile phones.  Yahoo's latest weapon is software that will let users find information like weather, news, stock quotes and sports scores more quickly on their cellphones. The software, called Go for Mobile 2.0, was unveiled Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, just as Google announced a partnership to put its own mobile software on Samsung cellphones.  Internet services on mobile phones remain a tiny market today, especially in the United States. But industry analysts and Internet companies believe they will eventually outgrow the market for computer-based Internet services as the capabilities of cellphones and the bandwidth of wireless networks improve rapidly.  ''We view the mobile Internet today as entering an era where the PC-based Internet was in '96 or '97,'' said Steve Boom, Yahoo's senior vice president for broadband and mobile. ''It is just on the cusp of taking off.''  For Yahoo, securing a leading position in that market is especially important. The company has struggled over the last year, as Google solidified its lead in search and leaped ahead in online video by acquiring YouTube. Yahoo has also been criticized as lacking initiative and being slow to capitalize on Internet trends like social networking, now dominated by MySpace and Facebook.  Yahoo's introduction of mobile software was reported Monday in The Wall Street Journal. The software, a revamped version of technology that the company introduced last year, makes it easy to move among various online services providing news, sports scores, maps, weather, movies, photos and e-mail. The free ad-supported services will be tailored to match a user's settings, like ZIP code and stock preferences, on Yahoo's existing online services.  The software will also be equipped with a search service, oneSearch, that will interpret a user's intent and deliver results accordingly. For instance, when a user searches for a sports team, the service will make a bet that the user is interested in the latest scores, a team profile and news related to the team, and return those first. More general Web links, like those returned in typical Internet searches, will be de-emphasized.  ''It's the kind of thing that Yahoo very much needs to extend further onto the mobile platform,'' said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm based in Bethesda, Md.  The service is already available on about 70 handset models and is expected to be on some 400 devices by the end of the year, Mr. Boom said. Yahoo has signed agreements with handset makers to preload or distribute the software. Yahoo is also encouraging users to download the software directly onto their devices.  Yahoo's mobile services were used by 6.8 percent of cellphone users in the United States in October, according to Telephia, a research firm. That made Yahoo, whose most popular wireless service is e-mail, the No. 1 mobile Internet company. But in mobile search, Google already tops Yahoo, according to Telephia.  Google said its cellphone search, e-mail and map products would be preloaded on Samsung phones. Deep Nishar, Google's director of wireless products and strategy, said the company's mobile search service already emphasized results that users typically want, like sports scores and movie times and locations.  To succeed, both companies will need to secure cooperation from wireless carriers, which could prove a challenge for some time as several offer competing services, said Julie Ask, an analyst at Jupiter Research.  Yahoo said some overseas carriers had agreed to support its services. Mr. Boom said it was ''a matter of time'' before American carriers followed suit. As an incentive, Yahoo is offering to share revenue from any advertising on the system, he said.  Ms. Ask noted that, for now, most cellphone advertising consists of text messages sent directly to users, and that ad revenues from mobile search and Web browsing are minuscule.  ",

                    "text": "  The Los Angeles Lakers missed Kobe Bryant's other-worldliness, fans at Madison Square Garden missed his showmanship and the Knicks, for once, did not miss the golden opportunity that was handed to them.  They rode Eddy Curry's offense, enjoyed a surprising resurgence by Jared Jeffries and beat back the Lakers for a 99-94 victory last night. With Bryant yanked from the stage by a league suspension, the evening lacked pyrotechnics, star quality and drama.  But for those who came to see the Knicks (20-27) claim a rare victory against an elite team, the night ended with some satisfaction. All five starters scored in double figures, led by Curry's 27 points. Jeffries, who started for the injured Quentin Richardson, filled up the box score and had a game-clinching block with 12.1 seconds left to play.  The Knicks, who had beaten just one team with a winning record in the past month, held on despite losing a 9-point lead in the first half and a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter.  ''You're never going to blow them out,'' Coach Isiah Thomas said. ''They're a team with a great coach, who understands how to manipulate a game and keep his team close.''  Thomas praised the Lakers (27-18) at length for their resiliency and, with a smile, concluded: ''But I'm glad Kobe didn't play. I'm really happy he didn't play.''  Twice in the previous eight days, the Knicks lost to teams missing their star players -- in Milwaukee (Michael Redd) and Miami (Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal). The Lakers, who were also missing the starters Luke Walton and Kwame Brown, kept the game close behind Lamar Odom (25 points and 9 rebounds).  Odom and Vladimir Radmanovic made 3-pointers to spark a late rally, knocking the deficit down to 96-94 with 45.8 seconds left. Curry hit two free throws to extend the lead to 4 points. He finished 9 for 12 from the foul line -- no small thing, given his own struggles and Thomas's recent rant about the Knicks' poor foul shooting. The Knicks shot free throws for an hour on Monday.  ''It meant a lot,'' Curry said of his late free throws, ''because I know how important free throws are to this team and especially to Coach.''  After Curry's free throws, the Lakers' Maurice Evans had a 3-pointer rattle out of the rim, but they still had a chance after Jamal Crawford ran (or was bumped) out of bounds for a turnover. But Jeffries reached out and blocked a 3-point try by Brian Cook in the corner, handing the Lakers their first three-game losing streak of the season.  Only a week ago, Jeffries was benched by Thomas and had his playing time slashed. Jeffries had been ineffective for weeks. But with Richardson nursing a sprained elbow, Thomas turned back to Jeffries, who responded with his best game in a month -- 14 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals, 2 blocked shots and 1 turnover in 32 minutes.  ''I thought the way he competed was impressive, considering the ups and downs that he's been having,'' Thomas said.  Booed during pregame introductions, Jeffries was cheered for his hustle several times throughout the night.  ''Those kind of things are why I'm here,'' said Jeffries.  Stephon Marbury scored 22 points but aggravated his sore left knee and sat out the last 35.2 seconds. He landed awkwardly after leaping to grab an errant inbounds pass from Jeffries.  Marbury recently sat out a game to rest the knee but said he would play tonight in Charlotte.  ''I just landed funny,'' he said. ''I'm all right.''  The chance to see Bryant had drawn a larger-than-usual cadre of celebrities, from the comedian Jon Stewart to the rapper Eve, the singer Nick Lachey and the real-estate mogul Donald Trump.  Bryant was suspended earlier in the day, for elbowing San Antonio's Manu Gin\u00f3bili in the face Sunday during a loss to the Spurs. Fans booed loudly when the suspension was announced before tip-off -- an unheard-of reaction, given that the punishment was for an opponent.  Thomas did not share their disappointment.  ''I'm a big fan of Kobe and I like him personally,'' Thomas said. ''You hate to see anyone suspended. But I don't want to face him, I don't want to face Shaq, I don't want to face Vince Carter, I don't want to face any of the best players in the league, because I know what they're capable of.''  What about the fans, who were denied their only chance to see Bryant play here this season?  ''Video games, television, catch him the next time,'' Thomas said with a laugh. ''I'm sure they'll have a couple of national television games, and all of New York can tune in and watch him.''  REBOUNDS  Quentin Richardson said that his right elbow injury was not serious and that he hoped to return to the lineup tonight in Charlotte. Richardson sprained the elbow in a practice last week and scored 6 points over his next three games, going 3 for 14 from the field. ''It just wasn't feeling that good,'' said Richardson, who is averaging 13.3 points. Richardson had a bandage on the elbow when he spoke with reporters, but he said he had not received an injection or had the elbow drained. ''It got scratched,'' he said.  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  In March, necessity moved Carmen Laureano and her two daughters from Florida to New York City.  Ms. Laureano, 36, lost her job when the day care center where she had worked for about three years came under new ownership. ''Everything changed for me; everything was down,'' she said.  She moved with her girls, Luz and Franchesca Rivera, 12 and 10, to the Bronx, hoping to stay with her mother. But the young family could not stay in her mother's housing complex for the elderly. She and the girls quickly found themselves homeless and entered the shelter system.  ''For the people living in the shelter it's not that easy to get out,'' Ms. Laureano said. But she did. With persistence, determination and some help from Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, Ms. Laureano has made a new city her family's new home.  In June, they moved into a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, and Ms. Laureano gave the bedroom to her daughters so they ''could have privacy.'' Framed family photos hang in the living room, where Ms. Laureano sleeps.  For a year, the $925 monthly rent is covered by Housing Stability Plus, a Department of Homeless Services program that offers a five-year subsidy that decreases gradually each year. Ms. Laureano is already worried about paying next year's rent.  ''I'm going to start studying because in one year I have to work,'' she said. Since moving here in the spring, Ms. Laureano has spent her time finding housing, schools and medical services for her family and caring for her daughters. She plans to take computer classes with the help of Catholic Charities. ''I have to start paying rent by myself.''  Her willingness to work is real, but so are her worries. Caring for Franchesca takes a special effort. ''Franchesca is a special girl,'' Ms. Laureano said. A lack of oxygen to her daughter's brain during birth caused mild mental retardation and behavioral problems. Ms. Laureano must be home when Franchesca returns from school. ''I have to be here, at 3; I have to be downstairs,'' she said.  Finding the right school to meet her daughter's needs was also a challenge. When they arrived in New York, Franchesca was mistakenly put in mainstream classes.  ''My daughter was in regular class and it was a mess,'' Ms. Laureano said. Franchesca was disruptive and could not do the work. ''It was hard for her, for the teacher, for the students.''  Ms. Laureano found help and a feeling of home, at the Thorpe Family Residence in the Bronx, where the family lived while it was homeless. The Thorpe residence is affiliated with Catholic Charities, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Thorpe staff connected Ms. Laureano to the services she needed. ''They give you support,'' she said. ''They help you out a lot. They are like a family.''  Counselors at Thorpe referred her to medical and educational services for Franchesca, and Ms. Laureano did considerable work following through. ''I have to start from the shelter, then I have to talk with the social worker to see if she could help me,'' she said, ''I went to two schools before I get that school.''  The school is Public School 161, where Franchesca started in the fall. She is in Spanish-language special education classes with her peers, working at a first-grade level. The family is from Puerto Rico, and Ms. Laureano taught herself English in Florida. Luz, in the sixth grade, speaks both Spanish and English, but is in some bilingual classes to provide better comprehension.  Franchesca, who speaks Spanish, was crying on the first day. But, by the second day, ''she was the friend of the teacher,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Being taught in Spanish and working with children at her level has made a big difference for Franchesca.  ''Mommy, Mommy, I know how to read!'' Ms. Laureano remembered her daughter announcing one day after school. The family celebrated, ''We made a party,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Ms. Laureano was also referred to a clinic for her daughter's mental health issues, and Franchesca received new medication to control her behavior. Now, Franchesca is calm and more focused, Ms. Laureano said. ''She could really learn. She could hear. Without the medication she just wants to fight.''  The family's monthly income is limited to $145 in public assistance and $255 in food stamps. With the help of staff members at Thorpe, Ms. Laureano is applying for Social Security supplemental income for Franchesca.  Two weeks after school began, the family received $425 in Neediest Cases money for school clothes, shoes, socks and underwear. The family also bought four folding chairs to put around a dining table. ''Thank you for all the help,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Franchesca is shy around strangers. She stayed in the bedroom and sometimes hid under the covers. She is not shy with her family. ''No way,'' Ms. Laureano laughed. ''It's different when we three are alone.''

She was Luz Rivera, Ms. Laureano's 12-year-old daughter, not Ms. Laureano.  ",

Because of the Senate's close partisan divide, most members are reluctant to miss votes to hit the campaign trail.  So while Mitt Romney, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, was able to meet voters and donors in South Carolina yesterday and John Edwards, the former Democratic senator from North Carolina, can do the same in New Hampshire and New York tomorrow, members of the Senate presidential caucus will be glued to Washington for a vote on raising the minimum wage.  Next week, it is all hands on the Senate deck for a vote on a resolution disapproving of President Bush's plan to send 21,000 additional troops to Iraq.  That explains why Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is spending her weekends in Iowa and New Hampshire. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois was in New Orleans yesterday for a hearing on domestic security but planned to return to Washington today. One exception is Senator Sam Brownback, the Kansas Republican. He will be in Iowa, Michigan, South Carolina and Florida today through Friday. A spokesman said he would be in Washington for votes on the Iraq deployment or any other critical questions.  JOHN M. BRODER  POLITICAL ACTION  ",

In the race for No. 2, CBS outdrew NBC, and both networks overshadowed the premieres on ABC. CBS's only new show of the night, ''The King of Queens,'' ranked second at 8 p.m. with 8.6 million viewers. It was followed by repeats of ''Two and a Half Men'' at 8:30 (8.5 million), ''Criminals Minds'' at 9 (11.9 Million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10 (10.4 million). NBC was not far behind, getting a boost from ''Deal or No Deal'' at 9 (11.3 million) and ''Medium'' at 10 (9.3 million). Faring less well for NBC, ''Friday Night Lights'' earned 6.3 million viewers at 8. ABC was last over all, despite the season premiere of ''According to Jim'' at 8 (7.4 million). Neither of ABC's new comedies, ''Knights of Prosperity'' at 9 (7.2 million) or ''In Case of Emergency'' at 9:30 (6.3 million), fared better than fourth place.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

                    "text": "  In promising to stop Iran from meddling in Iraq, President Bush returned Wednesday night to a strategy of confrontation in dealing with Tehran, casting aside what had been a limited flirtation with a more diplomatic approach toward it.  Mr. Bush accused Iran of providing material support for attacks on American troops and vowed to respond. ''We will disrupt the attacks on our forces,'' he said in his speech. ''We will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq.''  Mr. Bush said the United States would send another aircraft carrier and its supporting ships to the Persian Gulf. Administration officials said the battle group would be stationed within quick sailing distance of Iran, a response to the growing concern that Iran is building up its own missile capacity and naval power, with the goal of military dominance in the gulf.  Mr. Bush also announced the deployment of Patriot missiles to protect America's gulf allies. A battery of such missiles is already in Qatar, having been moved there several months ago.  The more combative talk reflects increased frustration in the administration with Iran, which American officials blame for part of the rising death toll in Iraq.  Military officials in Baghdad say they have documented a gradual rise in the number of sophisticated roadside bombs using ''shaped charges'' -- a type of weapon that commanders believe is imported from Iran. According to military statistics, 78 coalition troops were killed and 243 were wounded by these bombs between September and December of last year, compared with 53 killed by the bombs in the previous nine months.  American officials have provided members of Congress information to support the claim that Iran is helping to orchestrate attacks on Americans in Iraq, but the administration has not made that information public.  The American officials say that the Revolutionary Guard's Quds force trains inside Iran and then dispatches operatives into Iraq, using contacts with Iraqi Shiite militias to attack American troops.  ''They're training to kill coalition forces,'' said one senior American counterterrorism official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Their comments about wanting to see a stable Iraq are belied by this type of activity.''  Gen. Michael V. Hayden, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told Congress late last year that while he was originally skeptical of reports of Iranian operations inside Iraq, he now had the ''zeal of a convert'' on the matter.  One American official who recently returned from a trip to Baghdad said American commanders in Iraq believed that Iran was using its vast political influence to press Shiite politicians not to forge any long-term agreements with Sunnis.  ''We caught them with their finger in the cookie jar last month,'' a senior administration official said, referring to the arrest of five Iranians in Iraq whom the Americans accused of running guns and planning sectarian attacks. The Iranians were eventually released by Iraqi authorities.  American officials maintain that the latest moves should not be seen as preparations for a military strike against Iran. But they also said that Mr. Bush's top deputies, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley, had decided that, barring some major conciliatory move from Tehran, American moves to engage Iran had run their course.  The United States has grown frustrated with what one administration official described as the ''molasseslike'' pace of diplomatic efforts at the United Nations to impose broad sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.  The Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 with sanctions intended to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes but the United States and some European nations contend is for the purpose of creating nuclear arms. The measure bars the trade of goods or technology related to Iran's nuclear program.  But American officials acknowledge that the resolution is too weak to force Iran to abandon its nuclear program and are seeking to increase economic and psychological pressure on Iran. The United States is pressing governments and financial institutions in Europe, Japan and China to cut some of their financial ties with Iran.  For instance, during talks in Washington last week between Ms. Rice and visiting Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi of China, American officials urged Beijing to abandon a proposal for a $16 billion natural gas deal for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation to develop Iran's North Pars gas field, American officials said. The Chinese assured the United States that a decision was not imminent, American officials said.  Mr. Bush is expected to seek to apply pressure to other countries to limit their dealings with Iran in the coming month. American officials are hoping that the economic pressure will also persuade Iran not to actively oppose the new Bush strategy in Iraq.  THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ  ",

                    "text": "  China and Russia vetoed an American-drafted resolution on Friday calling for the military rulers of Myanmar to release all political prisoners, cease attacks on ethnic minorities and speed a transition to democracy.  The vote was 9 to 3 with South Africa joining China and Russia in opposition, and three other countries, Congo Republic, Indonesia and Qatar, abstaining.  The Security Council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- hold veto power over most resolutions.  China and Russia argued that they shared concerns about conditions in Myanmar but considered them internal matters that did not constitute threats to international peace and security, the category of crisis subject to Security Council action.  ''Not a single one of the neighboring countries regards the situation in Myanmar as a threat to them, and on the basis of that, there were no grounds for the Security Council to consider the matter,'' said Vitaly I. Churkin, Russia's ambassador.  Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said, ''Of course there are problems in Myanmar, but we believe that these problems do not constitute a threat to international peace and security.''  Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting American ambassador, said he was ''deeply disappointed'' at the outcome but noted even countries voting against the measure made clear in explanatory statements that they were not defending Myanmar's government. ''This was a jurisdictional issue behind the split vote here,'' he said. ''There was no disagreement about the content and substance behind this resolution.''  Mr. Wolff was asked why the United States risked dividing the Council and muddling its message to the repressive rulers of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.  ''The only mixed message here is whether this issue deserved to be on the Security Council agenda,'' he said. ''There is no mixed message, no mixed signal at all, about how the international community, how this Council feels about the situation in Burma.''  The resolution mentioned by name the most prominent political prisoner, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader, who is under house arrest.  It also accused Myanmar's armed forces of attacking and raping civilians from the country's ethnic minorities and causing a refugee crisis in the region, enabling narcotics traffic and permitting international transmission of communicable diseases like H.I.V./AIDS and avian flu.  R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said he had no doubt that the abuses by Myanmar posed a threat beyond its borders. ''When a million people flee the country because of the abusive practices of the government, that's a threat to international peace and security,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington.  ''When you have a political movement jailed,'' he said, ''led by a woman who is one of the greatest people in the world, that's a threat to international peace and security.''  He dismissed suggestions that the proper United Nations forum for Myanmar was the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, not the Security Council. ''We forced this onto the agenda for one reason,'' he said. ''The Security Council is the only place that can deal with human rights. The Human Rights Council is a discredited institution. All it has done is to bash Israel; it has ignored North Korea, it has ignored Sudan and it has ignored Burma.''  After the vote, Kyaw Tint Swe, Myanmar's ambassador, thanked China and Russia for blocking the move and said the charges against his country in the resolution were ''patently false.''  The double veto was the first multiple veto in the Security Council since 1989, when Britain, France and the United States blocked a resolution on Panama.  ",

The N800 adds a Web cam for videoconferencing and a microphone for Internet phone calls.  As a media player, the N800 handles MP3 and Windows Media files and other common audio and video formats, displaying images on a 4.1-inch color screen and playing audio through built-in stereo speakers or a headphone. Content can be loaded from SD or MMC memory cards, streamed from the Web or downloaded through a U.S.B. connection from another computer. The tablet uses Wi-Fi networking, but it can also connect to a compatible Nokia phone via Bluetooth and use it as a wireless modem.  The tablet, available from retailers and www.nokiausa.com for $400, has an on-screen keyboard. It will recognize text written with a stylus, which can also be used for doodling.

                    "text": "  Stephanie Robinson Davis and Randy Davis are young parents just starting out. There can be a lot to learn, but in the Davises' house, they already know that their children come first.  ''I try my best to give them everything I didn't have,'' said Mr. Davis, 27. ''I want them to have a stable home. I never really had a stable home because I was in and out of foster care.''  Nyliyah, 2, danced around the coffee table. ''Me comfortable,'' she said in a singsong voice.  Ms. Davis, 26, laughed at her daughter's energy, saying, ''It's got to be the Froot Loops.''  The couple's other child, Shymell, 4, named for his quiet nature, even as a baby, watched the action from one corner of the immaculate living room, which Ms. Davis had carefully decorated and scrubbed to a shine.  As children, Mr. and Ms. Davis both spent years in foster care. Their cheerful home is proof of the new path they are making for their own children. The road has not always been easy.  Mr. Davis was born in 1980. He said drugs were booming then, and ''my mother, she was really on it hard.'' He was raised mostly by his grandmother, who died when he was 11. He was then placed in a foster home in the Bronx.  Meanwhile, Ms. Davis landed in foster care herself as her mother battled her own addictions and abusive relationships. Still, throughout the nearly 12 years that she was in foster care, her mother fought to stay in her life. ''My mother always made sure that we was close, always,'' Ms. Davis said.  She is the oldest of eight children and fiercely protective of her siblings. ''I know what it's like to be a mother. It's easy to take care of my children because I know what it's like to be a mother since a very young age,'' she said.  Throughout their tumultuous childhoods, both of the Davises found an adult they could count on: Jean Marie De Veaux, education coordinator at the Family Foster Care program of the Children's Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  ''I've been knowing her since I was a itty-bitty little person,'' Ms. Davis said. Ms. De Veaux provided information about schools, scholarships, jobs and bill-paying. Anything the Davises needed to know, they went to Ms. De Veaux.  Mr. Davis said: ''If I needed help, she was there for me. I love Miss Jean Marie De Veaux.''  The couple met as young adults at a day care center where they were both working in jobs they got through the Children's Aid Society. Ms. Davis had been hired full time after completing an internship, and Mr. Davis was working there during breaks from college at Norfolk State University in Virginia.  In May 2002, Mr. Davis left school about a semester short of graduation. Ms. Davis was pregnant with Shymell, and Mr. Davis would not think of her going through pregnancy alone, nor of his child's life beginning without him. Mr. Davis hopes to complete his degree and says he misses college. ''I wanted to be a social worker; that's what I majored in,'' he said.  Mr. Davis ended up working in construction, even though the income was quite unstable and he found the work unsatisfying. Ms. Davis was a seasonal Parks Department employee.  Their lives became even more of a struggle one day in March when Ms. Davis's mother died suddenly from a heart problem. Ms. Davis took on more family responsibility. Her savings went to cover funeral costs and to help provide for her younger siblings.  Her 3-year-old brother, Malikk, is of the greatest concern. She is helping her oldest brother care for him now. ''We all have to decide what we're going to do right now to keep this family together,'' Ms. Davis said. Her brother Alfred Robinson, 19, also sometimes lives with the Davises.  ''I wouldn't trade it in for a minute, because they all give me some type of support,'' she said.  Ms. Davis's job came to an end for the season in March, coincidentally on the day her mother died. The aftermath has derailed her search for a new job.  The Davises receive $345 in food stamps each month and $119.50 in public assistance. The $184 rent on their two-bedroom apartment in Harlem is covered by public assistance.  By the fall, construction work for Mr. Davis had slowed and the family was struggling to keep up. They turned to Ms. De Veaux for help. She used $605.59 in Neediest Cases money: $300 for clothing vouchers for the children, $152 for two monthly MetroCards for continuing job searches and $153.59 toward part of a phone bill.  The Children's Aid Society also helped with employment. On Nov. 14, Mr. Davis started working part time at the organization's P.S. 8 Community Schools program. ''I love it. I love working with kids,'' he said. He hopes to do more. ''If they put me full time, I'd jump and touch the sky.''  With a little help from Neediest Cases, and continuing help from Ms. De Veaux, the Davises are making it.  Ms. De Veaux said, ''When they had each of their babies, I watched them trying to recreate the love and stability that they missed out on, in part. This is such a success story, I think, from foster care because they've been through a lot.  ''This is what marriage is. This is what commitment is. It's not what you see in the movies.''

                    "text": "  As part of their 100-hour legislative blitz, House Democrats are expected to vote today to increase the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, to $7.25 an hour, in a move that economists say will raise pay for 13 million workers.  The bill's chances are less certain in the Senate, largely because of friction over a Republican push to include tax breaks for small business in the bill. Senate Republicans have hinted that, without such tax cuts, they will filibuster the measure, a move that the bill's supporters would need 60 votes to overcome.  The legislation would lift the federal wage floor, currently $5.15 an hour, to $7.25 in three steps between now and 2009.  ''Minimum-wage workers desperately need a raise,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. ''It is a moral outrage that millions of Americans who work full time still live in poverty.''  After opposing a minimum-wage increase for years, many Republicans now say they favor one, but only if it is coupled with a tax cut for restaurants and other small businesses -- the groups they say would be hurt most by the wage increase.  ''The Democrat leadership's unbalanced proposal may increase the minimum wage, but it leaves small businesses and their workers to fend for themselves,'' said Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, the ranking Republican on the Education and Labor Committee.  On Tuesday, Mr. McKeon and Jim McCrery of Louisiana, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced a competing minimum-wage bill that includes billions of dollars in tax breaks. One such break would allow faster depreciation for newly built restaurants, allowing them to record the building cost on financial statements over 15 years instead of the current rule of 39 years, and thus lower taxes.  President Bush has said he might accept a higher minimum wage, but only if it is tied to tax cuts to soften the blow for business.  Some Democrats and many of their liberal and labor allies assert that the minimum wage should not be used as an excuse to give more tax breaks to business.  ''For the past 10 years, Republican leaders have held the minimum wage hostage,'' said the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney. ''Corporations and wealthy Americans have gotten their rewards. Now it's time to do the right thing for low-wage workers, with no payoffs to business.''  Frustrated by Congress's inaction, 28 states have adopted minimum wages above the federal floor, affecting 70 percent of the work force.  In an unusual move for a minimum-wage bill -- typically it is handled by the House and Senate labor committees -- the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing today on the bill.  ''To call a minimum-wage increase 'overdue' is the understatement of the year,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the committee's chairman. ''This Congress promised to raise the minimum wage, and we will. We also need to pass meaningful small-business incentives along with a wage increase. We can do both, and we will.''  Many economists, especially conservative ones, insist that raising the minimum wage would not reduce poverty, saying it would ultimately reduce the number of jobs for low-skilled workers. But other economists, especially liberal ones, say a higher minimum would have virtually no effect on job levels while it lifted the pay for millions of low-wage workers.  ''The increase will make a big difference for someone who makes the minimum wage -- you're talking about thousands of dollars a year in extra earnings,'' said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, and one of the economists scheduled to testify before the Finance Committee. ''It's important to remember that if you don't have a binding wage floor, a lot of workers are going to end up disconnected from the improving economy and that's exactly what's happened.''  Mr. Bernstein's institute estimates that six million workers earn less than $7.25 an hour, but workers earning a dollar or two more than that can also expect to see their wages increase if a new minimum is enacted.  Joseph Sabia, a professor of consumer economics at the University of Georgia, said an increase would do little to lift workers out of poverty.  ''Most people who earn the minimum wage are not poor or near poor,'' Professor Sabia said. ''If the goal is to help the working poor, it would be better to raise the earned-income tax credit,'' which refunds cash to poor workers.  The traditional economists' view has been that a higher minimum wage would mean some job losses for low-wage workers. But a landmark 1994 study by David Card and Alan Krueger upset the common wisdom by finding that there were no overall job losses when New Jersey raised its minimum wage.  David Neumark, a longtime critic of that study and an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, said most credible studies had concluded that an increase in the minimum wage did hurt employment for unskilled workers, although most studies did not find major job reductions. He said an increase to $7.25 might reduce job levels for the least skilled workers by 4 percent.  ''The most affected workers are the ones you'd most like to help,'' Professor Neumark said. ''If the workers who get raises are middle-class teenagers and the ones who lose jobs are unskilled workers in poor jobs, you can increase poverty.''  Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, acknowledged that there might be some job losses, but he said that they would be minor and would be far outweighed by the wage gains.  ''Minimum-wage earners are concentrated in the bottom half of families by income,'' Professor Holzer said. ''They might not be in the bottom 10 percent, but they might be in the bottom 10 to 40 percentile. Will a minimum-wage increase dramatically reduce poverty? Probably not. But it will redistribute income toward the bottom half of American workers.''  THE 110TH CONGRESS  ",

                    "text": "  FOR years, the noise, vibration and fumes from Long Island Rail Road trains idling on a track siding in the Village of Patchogue have been a nuisance to residents. But after the installation of an automated signal system last May, the idling trains are now virtually in some residents' backyards.  Jack Eddington, a Suffolk County legislator whose district includes Patchogue, said a six-foot chain-link fence is all that separates the trains from the backyards of homeowners on Academy Street.  ''The trains are literally 10 feet from their homes,'' he said.  Ann M. Goodhue, who lives on the opposite side of Academy Street, said she found the ''train situation atrocious.'' She said vibrations from three trains that sat idling on the siding several years ago cracked her second-floor ceiling.  Mr. Eddington said he had been at the siding when two trains were idling and found the noise very loud. ''And they give off a diesel smell,'' he said.  Until several years ago, the siding was about a mile west in a commercial area. Mr. Eddington said complaints from residents were fewer because a lumberyard and a bowling alley were on either side of the tracks and homes were far from the idling trains. But about six years ago, he said, trains were instructed to idle about three-quarters of a mile to the east, ''and it became a general nuisance because it was almost right in the middle of town.''  When a new signal system was installed last May about 200 to 300 feet farther east to align with a switch for the tracks, train engineers were instructed to idle there, said Susan McGowan, a railroad spokeswoman.  Mr. Eddington said that change put the trains ''right along the backyards of 12 or 13 homes'' on Academy Street.  ''I want the railroad to do the right thing'' for the residents, he said. ''I have looked up and down the track, and I see areas that don't have homes. I'm not telling them where they should go, but what I am saying is that where they are now is not acceptable.''  Ms. McGowan said that in an effort to ''minimize the inconvenience,'' the railroad had relocated two of six weekday trains that use the siding. One was moved 10 to 20 feet to the north siding, and a second was moved to a siding in Speonk.  ''These are the first steps we have taken,'' she said. ''We're continuing to look at the situation.''

                    "text": "  Iran is barring 38 nuclear agency inspectors from entering the country in retaliation for a United Nations resolution aiming to curb Iran's nuclear program, a senior Iranian lawmaker said Monday.  The announcement came only days after Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, Iran's most senior dissident cleric, criticized President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's defiant stance against the West on the nuclear issue in a speech on Friday, calling it provocative. His comments were the first direct public attack on the president's nuclear policy by such a senior cleric.  The two developments suggest an increasingly open debate within Iran over how forcefully to confront the West over Iran's nuclear ambitions, even as its government continues to defend them.  Two hard-line newspapers, including one owned by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have already called for the president to stay out of all nuclear matters. Ayatollah Montazeri said Iran has the right to nuclear technology but questioned the way Mr. Ahmadinejad has confronted the West.  ''One has to deal with the enemy with wisdom,'' he said. ''We should not provoke the enemy, otherwise the country will be faced with problems.  ''We should get our right in a way that it does not create problems or excuses for others,'' he said.  ''Besides, is this our only irrefutable right and we have no other rights?'' he asked, referring to rising inflation since Mr. Ahmadinejad took office over a year ago.  Ayatollah Montazeri was once in line to become Iran's supreme religious leader, until he was banished and put under house arrest for his criticisms. His comments reflect the growing concern in Iran over additional economic sanctions if Iran continues to defy the international demand to halt its uranium enrichment program.  The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 and imposed sanctions banning the trade of goods related to Iran's nuclear program. It also gave Iran a deadline of two months to halt its uranium enrichment program or face tougher sanctions.  In response, Parliament passed a bill last month calling for the government to limit its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  ''The committee has decided to bar 38 inspectors from coming to Iran and we have announced the new limitation to the agency,'' said Alaedin Boroujerdi, the head of Parliament's committee for foreign policy and national security, the ISNA news agency reported.  The nuclear agency's inspectors visit Iran's nuclear facilities regularly. But last summer Iran said that it had decided not to let some of the inspectors return.  Still, Mr. Boroujerdi said that Iran planned to continue its cooperation with the agency, and that Iran would remain a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  An I.A.E.A. spokeswoman, Melissa Flemming, said that the agency was confident that it could continue to monitor Iran's nuclear program.  ''There are a sufficient number of inspectors designated for Iran, and the I.A.E.A. is able to perform its inspection activities in accordance with Iran's Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement,'' she said in an agency statement.  For his part, Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed again on Sunday that Iran would continue with its nuclear program, and brushed off the United Nations resolution as insignificant.  In Brussels on Monday, European Union foreign ministers called for all countries to enforce the sanctions against Iran. The British foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, said a collective application of the sanctions was essential ''to keep pressure on Iran to accept the offer of the international community to come back to the negotiating table.''  European Union officials said they would apply the measures next month, including a ban on selling materials and technology that could be used in Iran's nuclear and missile programs and the freezing of the assets of 10 Iranian companies and individuals.  Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said it was time to take a tough and united stance on Iran but kept the option of diplomacy open. ''There is a need to send a clear signal, and we need to show resolve,'' he said.  Correction:  January 25, 2007, Thursday  A front-page article on Friday about criticism of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, by Iranian religious authorities over his involvement in the country's nuclear program misstated the connection between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and Jomhouri-Eslami, a newspaper that has rebuked Mr. Ahmadinejad. (The error was repeated in an article about Iran on Tuesday.) Ayatollah Khamenei owned the newspaper until 1989, when he became supreme leader and transferred ownership to Massih Mohajeri, a conservative politician. However, the newspaper still reflects Ayatollah Khamenei's views.  ",

In the November rematch, the Patriots were without the injured Ty Warren, their stellar left end. In his absence, the Jets were successful running the ball, gaining 117 yards on the ground (65 more than in the first game) en route to a 17-14 victory. Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork expects to return after missing three games with a sprained ankle. He will be a handful for Jets center Nick Mangold, who has been nursing a left thigh injury.

                    "text": "  EMME of Capri, on Stamford's restaurant row (Summer Street), is so small you may pass it so quickly you'll have to backtrack.  Small doesn't mean insignificant, however. The mustard walls, with wood wainscoting and paintings of Italy, create the effect of an intimate cafe, warm and snug. The good-size menu features a number of interesting southern Italian choices, both for starters and entrees, and several intriguing desserts, a bit unusual for an Italian restaurant.  The crusty bread served with a pungent extra virgin olive oil was a good sign of pleasant dishes ahead.  I especially liked the Italian crepes as a starter. Stuffed with shiitake mushrooms, shrimp and artichoke hearts, they came in a gently seasoned brandy cream sauce with shallots. The portion was sensibly sized, so it didn't kill my appetite for an entree.  Other good choices were calamari all' agro, squid sauced in a piquant citrus sauce, and calamari and zucchini, the calamari crisply fried and mixed with fresh sliced zucchini. Funghi trifolati was also a winning selection -- three different mushrooms (shiitake, porcini and portobello) saut\u00e9ed in white truffle oil.  If you favor salad as a starter, there are seven to choose from. I was partial to the mista (fresh baby greens in olive oil and balsamic vinegar), both simple and zesty. Also appealing was the contadina -- crispy romaine lettuce with shaved parmigiano and crumbled Gorgonzola cheese in a sharp balsamic glaze.  Each menu comes with a printed attachment of the evening specials (a patron-friendly improvement on the verbal recitation at so many other places). One of my guests ordered cernia alla griglia -- fresh red grouper grilled, then sprinkled with extra virgin olive oil and lemon and served on a mound of broccoli rabe.  My own fish selection was less felicitous: salmone alla griglia. The waiter neglected to ask how I wanted the salmon prepared, and I forgot to specify lightly under-grilled. The end result was a filet tortuously overcooked. But the accompaniments were tasty: thin slices of zucchini saut\u00e9ed with garlic bits and well-roasted potato chunks.  Two pasta dishes were better entree selections. Orecchiette alla Pugliese consisted of tender pasta tossed with broccoli rabe and crumbles of sweet sausage; the bitter broccoli rabe was nicely balanced by the sausage. Farfalle ortolano was a textural contrast of bow-tie pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and shrimp, a pleasing combination of flavors. Another worthy dish was scaloppine Caprese -- lightly breaded, thin veal scallops topped with melted mozzarella, tomato slices, prosciutto and tomatoes.  Desserts are often an afterthought at Italian restaurants, but Emme surprised me with its options. Both the chocolate hazelnut cake (a rum-soaked sponge cake with hazelnut ganache) and lava di cioccolato (rich chocolate cake with soft interior served warm) were delicious. More predictable were the peach sorbet (served in a real frozen peach) and tartuffo al cioccolato (a chocolate covered ice cream ball).  There is a $20.99 lunch special, which includes salad, panini or pasta, and coffee or soda. Another good midday option is one of six panini on grilled rustic Italian bread. Hearty and excellent are the Marucella (grilled eggplant, zucchini and asparagus in extra virgin olive oil), Carosone (grilled chicken with fresh mozzarella and roasted red peppers in a picante balsamic glaze) and Annar\u00e8 (prosciutto di Parma, shaved parmigiano, tomatoes and arugula in a balsamic glaze).  Emme of Capri may be small, but it can pack a memorable punch.

                    "text": "  On paper, Gov. Jon S. Corzine may well get what he wants from the Legislature: a bill limiting annual increases in revenues from local property taxes to 4 percent.  But the proposed measure, which is most likely to be introduced in the Senate on Thursday by his fellow Democrats, is sprinkled with an array of exemptions, adjustments and waivers to the 4 percent limit.  That part of the measure seems intended to quiet some of the grumbling among local officials that they would bear the cost of easing the burden of property taxes on homeowners, yet it also falls short of what those officials have said is needed to make the governor's plan more equitable.  ''Look, we are really talking about whittling away at a portion of the tax levy for municipal services which in my town represents just 9 percent of the entire levy,'' said Louise C. Wilson, deputy mayor of Montgomery Township, adding that the rest of the tax levy goes to the local school district, which would have its own set of exemptions. ''And I know that if you start to grant so many exemptions, you're not going to have any cap.''  For one thing, some local finance officers said the provisions would not have an immediate effect because they would not be in place by July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, and that in the long run the exemptions could jeopardize the entire effort.  Last week, in a session sponsored by the League of Municipalities, Mr. Corzine defended a 4 percent limit on annual increases in revenues from local property taxes, saying that local governments needed to find alternative sources of revenue. But by the end of the session, after several mayors complained, he warmed to the notion of allowing exemptions and waivers in some cases.  In the measure to be introduced on Thursday by the Senate president, Richard J. Codey, money set aside to cover uncollected property taxes, revenue realized from new properties on the tax rolls, a small portion of pension costs and increases in health benefits are automatically exempted.  In addition, school districts would be allowed automatic adjustments for debt service, a portion of the costs associated with increased enrollment or the opening of a new school as well as capital outlays. The school districts would also be allowed adjustments for debt service and emergencies.  The measure would also allow local governments to apply each year to the Local Finance Board or the state commissioner of education for waivers from the 4 percent cap for extraordinary circumstances like a loss of state aid, the sudden infusion of nonrecurring revenue, one-time emergency spending for ''health, safety and the public welfare,'' and cost increases resulting from mandated spending and increases in energy costs above the cap level and in equipment leases.  The decisions of the finance board and the commissioner could not be appealed.  Lou Neely, the finance director of East Brunswick, who is also the expert on property tax reform for the state League of Municipalities, called the proposed property tax measure a grab bag.  Mr. Neely said that many of the exemptions made sense, although he added that they would slow any immediate benefits to taxpayers. He said the state would be flooded with waiver requests from municipalities and school districts without a mechanism to handle them. After all, he said, ''when you are hungry and somebody throws you a crumb, you grab it.''  Local officials complained that the legislation did nothing to mitigate the costs of awards in binding arbitrations, which occur after municipalities and unions reach an impasse in labor negotiations. Localities would be required under the bill to pay the costs associated with these awards regardless of the 4 percent cap on local property taxes.  Mr. Neely and other officials wanted either a state-ordered limitation on the awards, or a provision in the bill to exempt the awards from these caps. Without such an exemption, he said, money would have to be diverted from other items financed from the property tax to pay for these awards. The proposed legislation admonishes arbitrators to ''consider as a primary factor in their awards'' the effect on tax levy limitations. Similarly, it addresses increases in employee health costs faced by local governments, and encourages local officials to renegotiate contracts.  Mr. Neely said that the ''state has precluded us from reopening contracts in the past, and it is nice that they are now letting us do it.''  ''But,'' he added, ''they ought to say to arbitrators that this is a hard cap and you can't grant awards over it.''  Still, most local officials conceded that the measure would be approved.  Mayor Gary Passanante of Somerdale said property taxes would not ease up any time soon, primarily because they account for about 46 percent of local budgets, more than the national average of 30 percent.  Borrowing phrasing frequently used by Governor Corzine, Mr. Passanante said: ''Our benchmark for accomplishing reform that is for the common good is doing something that gets us closer to the national average of 30 percent. But nothing in the governor's package does this.''  POLITICAL MEMO  ",

                    "text": "  With the anticipated return of Quentin Richardson and Nate Robinson for Wednesday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden, the Knicks will be at nearly full strength in a season in which they have lost players to injuries and suspensions and often played better while shorthanded.  The question at Monday's practice, as it has been at other times this season, was who would be in the starting lineup Wednesday. Coach Isiah Thomas said that for the immediate future he would stay with the same players who started the final two games of the Knicks' recent trip, lopsided victories against Portland and Seattle.  ''I don't want to prejudge or predetermine anything,'' Thomas said. ''I want to see where everybody's game is at.''  Stephon Marbury, Eddy Curry, Jared Jeffries, Channing Frye and Jamal Crawford started in the victories against Portland and Seattle. Of those five, only Marbury and Curry seem assured of remaining starters, particularly as Richardson weaves his way back into the team's nucleus.  Richardson began the season as the Knicks' starting small forward, because Jeffries was out with a wrist injury, but then missed 11 games with a bad back. Thomas said Richardson would get some time to ''knock the rust off'' his game, as would Robinson, who has finished serving a 10-game suspension for fighting.  Because Richardson is the team's best 3-point shooter and because he can also play shooting guard, he may eventually start in place of Crawford, who can score in bunches and has become adept at lobbing the ball inside to Curry for easy baskets. Richardson plays better defense than Crawford, and he also rebounds well.  During his injury layoff, Richardson was a visible cheerleader on the bench. In one memorable moment, he ran across the court in a suit to embrace Frye after Frye, a second-year forward, made a tying shot during the Knicks' three-overtime victory against Detroit last month. On Monday, he was the proper diplomat, saying, ''My job is to come in and fit in.''  In recent weeks, the most constant lineup question Thomas faced -- and one he will continue to be questioned about -- was why the second-year forward David Lee, who has turned into one of the N.B.A.'s most capable rebounders, was not starting every game. Thomas's response has been to say that he likes the way Lee is playing, but that he believes Lee provides the team with more of a spark when he comes off the bench.  That could change, as could the roles of other players.  ''We'll give it a couple of games and see how it goes,'' said Thomas, who added that he felt good coming off a pair of victories on the West Coast. ''Good and lucky.''  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

Now you can get push-to-talk from Cingular as well, and the LG CU400 cellphone it recently began offering adds high-speed data services to the mix.  The CU400 is a G.S.M. phone that will work on cellular networks overseas. The push-to-talk service allows you to connect to another user of the service on Cingular or even send a broadcast message to up to 30 contacts.  The phone has a monochrome external screen, a bright main screen, a basic camera, Bluetooth wireless capabilities and supports Cingular's streaming audio and video services. It offers about five hours of talk time on one charge and weighs three ounces.  The CU400 sells for $30 with a two-year contract and rebate or $230 without a contract. Unlimited push-to-talk is $10 a month for each phone or $20 for a family plan.  Sleek styling and a rubberized finish ensure that nobody will mistake this phone for a walkie-talkie.

                    "text": "  Speaker Tom Craddick of the Texas House, an ally of the former United States House majority leader Tom DeLay, survived a strong challenge on Tuesday from a fellow Republican to win his third term in the leadership position on the first day of the 80th session of the Legislature.  After more than five hours of haggling about making public the votes for speaker, Representative Jim Pitts withdrew.  Slightly more than 30 minutes later, Mr. Craddick was elected, 121 to 27, to close the first floor effort to defeat an incumbent speaker since 1959.  Mr. Pitts, of Waxahachie, whom Mr. Craddick appointed chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has been in the House since 1992. He has at times disagreed with Mr. Craddick's leadership, which is often compared with Mr. DeLay's.  ''It's time to heal,'' Mr. Pitts said in a speech before the House after his withdrawal and before he voted for Mr. Craddick. ''It's time to go on with Texas's business.''  The victory of Mr. Craddick, of Midland, who has been in the Legislature since 1968, ended a fight that has dominated the political landscape here for three weeks. The House elects a speaker on the first day of each regular session every two years.  The speaker's duties include overseeing floor debates, appointing members to standing committees and referring measures to committees.  Bills on immigration and campaign finance overhaul have been filed for the session, which lasts until May 28.  Mr. Craddick, who has been speaker since January 2003, when he became the first Republican to hold the post in 130 years, was investigated along with Mr. DeLay over fund-raising in the 2002 legislative races but was not indicted by a grand jury in Travis County.  Mr. DeLay was indicted in September 2005 on charges of violating the campaign finance law. He worked closely with Mr. Craddick in redrawing district maps in 2003 that benefited Republicans.  In his acceptance speech, Mr. Craddick promised to work with Republicans and Democrats.  ''I want to assure each and every one of you today,'' Mr. Craddick said, ''that I believe my primary responsibility as your elected speaker is to fulfill your elected purpose, not mine.''  Gov. Rick Perry, also a Republican, expressed optimism for the session, mentioning a desire to improve health care, education and border security.  ''The success of this session will not be judged by what has happened over the last few hours,'' Mr. Perry said, ''but by what we do in the end.''  ",

                    "text": "  There were nine-tenths of a second left on the game clock when Danny Granger's 3-point attempt sailed past, and not through, the rim closest to the Knicks' bench Saturday night. The clock ticks that preceded that moment might have been the most anxious the Knicks had endured all week, which is saying a lot.  Last Wednesday, the Knicks lost to Washington on a dunk with 2.2 seconds left. On Friday, they lost to the Nets on a tip-in with 2.8 seconds left. So a 2-point lead late Saturday night against the Indiana Pacers was of no comfort when Granger pulled up from 29 feet.  ''I was holding my breath, saying all the Hail Marys and everything I possibly could,'' Coach Isiah Thomas said afterward. ''I know I couldn't take another heartbreaking loss like that at the end.''  The Knicks were spared a spirit-crushing conclusion this time. Granger, who had made three of six attempts from 3-point range, shot an air ball. Quentin Richardson gathered it, then heaved it into the air as the final buzzer sounded, and the Knicks escaped with a 108-106 victory at Conseco Fieldhouse.  The final score was about the only thing that felt good for the Knicks (18-24) at the end of another chaotic night. Eddy Curry was dominant, with 26 points, but fouled out with 2 minutes 31 seconds to play. Stephon Marbury had to pull himself from the game with 1:26 left because he could no longer run on an injured left knee.  The Knicks blew leads of 15 points in the third quarter and 10 points in the fourth, and they nearly lost the game with Marbury on the bench. They led by 6 points when Marbury left for good, but committed three consecutive turnovers against the Pacers' press. Indiana cut the deficit to a point twice in the final 11.2 seconds, both on Jermaine O'Neal layups. The Knicks held on, with Nate Robinson hitting three of four free throws in the final z10.1 seconds.  After that, the concern turned to Marbury's health.  ''I'm fine,'' he said.  Marbury said the injury was merely tendinitis and would not prevent him from playing Monday in Miami. Thomas seemed less certain.  ''We'll see where he's at,'' Thomas said. ''He's a pretty tough guy and he's been banged up all season long with that knee, and he's managed to get through.''  Marbury first injured the knee in a game here Dec. 15 but has not missed a game since then. He aggravated it in Friday's loss against the Nets, and twice more in the fourth quarter Saturday. Marbury hurt himself on a driving layup with 5:52 left, and grimaced as he jogged back up the court. But he did not take himself out until after he landed awkwardly when he was fouled with 1:42 left. In between, Jamaal Tinsley scored 6 points against Marbury, and the Pacers knocked an 8-point lead down to 2.  Marbury said the knee was not a factor in Tinsley's burst, but said he finally had to bench himself.  ''I would have been hurting the team if I had been out there,'' he said.  Marbury's absence was felt immediately. With the Pacers applying a press, Jamal Crawford threw away a pass. On the next possession, Malik Rose traveled as he crossed midcourt. Then Robinson committed a backcourt violation.  ''It was a hectic time,'' Rose said. ''We didn't do what we normally practice, and it almost cost us.''  An incensed Rose kicked a chair and bellowed for several minutes when he went back to the bench after his turnover. Rose said his anger was directed at himself and at the referees.  But the Knicks' worst stretch came in the third quarter, when the Pacers cut a 15-point deficit to 2. O'Neal, who had been quiet until then, got rolling and finished with 25 points and 10 rebounds. Granger had 19 points.  It was a disappointing finish for the Pacers (20-20) in the debut of their reconfigured roster after an eight-player trade with Golden State on Wednesday.  Mike Dunleavy, acquired in the deal, started at shooting guard and, after missing all four of his shots in the first half, scored 14 points in the second half. Troy Murphy, the other major player in the deal, came off the bench and had 10 points and 11 rebounds in 23 minutes.  Before the game, Pacers Coach Rick Carlisle defended the team's decision to trade the starters Al Harrington and Stephen Jackson. O'Neal criticized the trade after a game in Miami on Thursday night.  ''I felt like we had a crew of guys who could make it work,'' O'Neal said. ''With Al and those guys, I felt like we had the best five in the league.''  Carlisle said he was unaware of O'Neal's remarks, but he said that Donnie Walsh and Larry Bird, the team's top two officials, had talked to O'Neal about the trade.  ''This is part of the business,'' Carlisle said. ''If you want to get good players, you got to trade good players. My understanding is Larry and Don sat down with Jermaine and talked about the reasons for the trade. A lot of it was to enhance his ability as a franchise player. That was a real positive for him. On the other hand, it's tough when your best friends leave the team -- a guy like Al. We went through a lot to get him. None of us wanted to trade him.''  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  In a devastating condemnation of Consolidated Edison, state regulators have concluded that a failure to adequately maintain, operate and oversee its electrical network was ''the overriding cause'' of the nine-day blackout that paralyzed western Queens last July.  The regulators estimated that 174,000 people lost power in the blackout -- 70,000 more than was previously known. For the first three days of the blackout, Con Edison had insisted that no more than 8,000 people were affected.  In a 185-page draft report posted on its Web site last night, the staff of the New York State Public Service Commission concluded that the company had ''failed to fulfill its responsibilities'' under state law and recommended a formal proceeding that could result in large financial penalties against Con Edison.  The withering assessment and the prospect of hefty fines are all but certain to renew calls for the ouster of Con Edison's chairman and chief executive, Kevin M. Burke, who was widely blamed for failing to discern the magnitude of the blackout, which lasted from July 17 to 25, until three days after it started.  In its relentlessly critical language, the report sharply contradicts Con Edison's own 600-page report, released Oct. 12, which attributed the blackout to a series of events beyond its control, notably an underground fire, malfunctions in an electric breaker and a sudden surge of current.  The state report concludes instead that the primary cause of the blackout was ''the company's failure to address a multitude of pre-existing problems and issues associated with the operations, maintenance and oversight of the Long Island City network,'' which supplies power to about 460,000 people in western Queens.  The report suggests that the blackout lasted as long as it did because of Con Edison's ''failure to shut the network down in light of glaring evidence that the secondary system was experiencing severe damage'' in the early part of the blackout.  On the night of July 18, the second day of the event, top Con Edison managers contemplated shutting down the entire network, which would have caused an even wider blackout but would have caused less damage and been easier and faster to recover from.  Mr. Burke and other executives have since defended their decision not to shut down the network -- a decision that the new report suggests was a grave mistake.  Even as Con Edison's rank-and-file workers ''worked hard to contain the crisis,'' according to the report, ''the company's senior management failed or refused to comprehend the magnitude of the damage to its secondary system and the subsequent impact on customers.''  In a statement last night, a Con Edison spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin, said a controlled shutdown would have ''affected the lives of more than one million people, with no guarantee that power would have been restored any sooner.'' He added, ''We believed then, and still believe, that that would have been a worse situation.''  Mr. Clendenin said the utility was reviewing the report and ''will implement any actions necessary to reduce the likelihood of similar occurrences in the future.''  An analysis by The New York Times last summer, based on Con Edison documents, found that the Long Island City network had the most feeder-cable failures in 2004 and 2005 of any of the 57 networks. The analysis also found that several failures involved components that were 30 to 60 years old.  Con Edison said in response that the network was fine and among the top one-fourth of all underground networks in performance.  The new report rejected that argument. It stated that many of the network's components ''were not in conformance with the company's operating specifications.''  It added that Con Edison failed to understand the effects of load growth and transformer additions on the network. ''The size and complexity of the network,'' it said, ''outpaced the sophistication of the company's primary planning and contingency analysis tools.''  The report also found that that the utility's performance was ''particularly unacceptable'' when it came to communicating with the public.  Con Edison never gave a precise estimate of the number of people affected in the blackout. Its final rough guess was 25,000 customers -- a term that includes residential buildings and businesses and was said to translate to roughly 100,000 people. The new report found that the blackout affected 65,000 customers, or about 174,000 people.  The lack of a reliable estimate delayed Con Edison's response to the blackout and the arrival of emergency resources, according to the report, which called the absence of a system to properly assess damages and outages ''a major failing.''  Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat whose district included much of the area affected by the blackout, said the new report vindicated the utility's critics. ''Clearly, the fiction that Con Edison's decisions were correct has been exposed,'' he said.  Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat and the chairman of a committee that oversees the Public Service Commission, said the draft report should be accompanied by financial penalties. ''There's a lot of criticism, but no action,'' he said. ''That's not good enough.''  The commission's chairman at the time of the blackout, William M. Flynn, ordered the investigation on July 26, a day after the blackout ended. The commission held five days of hearings from August to November.  The staff originally intended to issue the draft report by Dec. 31. Con Edison and others may comment by Jan. 31. Then the commission will approve a final version.  In a related action, the commission yesterday approved the hiring of a consultant, Vantage Consulting of Cudjoe Key, Fla., to conduct an independent audit of Con Edison's electric emergency response program. Con Edison is to cover the cost of the work, which is not to exceed $800,800.  The commission ordered the audit in September and received seven proposals from consultants in November, before selecting Vantage.  ",

Mr. Bonacic was referring to his vocal opposition to the re-election of the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, as temporary president of the Senate, after the revelation that Mr. Bruno's outside consulting work is the subject of a federal investigation. Last week, Mr. Bonacic walked out of the Senate chamber rather than cast the only vote against Mr. Bruno, the state's most powerful Republican.  Mr. Bonacic said Mr. Bruno had done nothing to make him feel unwelcome since then. ''That's behind us now,'' said Mr. Bonacic, who joked that both his kneecaps and his supply of office materials remained intact.  Still, he cautioned, in politics, people never forget.  ''I'm going to see how we are treated as we go forward,'' he said.  He mused for a few moments, and then mentioned the recent defection of Mr. Balboni, left, which left Republicans with a slimmer 33-28 majority.  ''The truth of the matter is, Senator Balboni went with Eliot Spitzer,'' and not against Mr. Bruno, Mr. Bonacic said, explaining why the Bruno forces were unlikely to retaliate.  ''We need each other, for the strength of the conference,'' Mr. Bonacic added. ''This is not the time for bloodshed.''  NICHOLAS CONFESSORE  ALBANY NOTEBOOK  ",

The El Forno brand from Spain, which is sold at Agata & Valentina, comes in a nine-inch size that will serve six to eight ($10.99), and with spinach or peppers in a seven-inch size to serve four ($9.99).

All sides have now settled a lawsuit that accused Yonkers of conducting an inadequate environmental review in its rush to greenlight the project, which will include 1,000 homes, 1.3 million square feet of retail space and who knows how many cars barrelling -- or crawling, as the case may be -- along the roads in and around it, including the Sprain Brook Parkway, the New York State Thruway and Tuckahoe Road.  As settlements go, it doesn't offer much for Yonkers's adversaries. Greenburgh, Hastings-on-Hudson, Ardsley and some residents of Yonkers itself had complained that traffic from Ridge Hill would engulf their streets. They wanted the city and the developer, Forest City Ratner (which is also building The Times's new headquarters in Manhattan), to scale back.  But that didn't happen. About all the settlement calls for is $5 million to mitigate traffic at certain intersections, and the creation of a task force to jointly lobby Westchester County and New York State to ease the traffic problem once and for all by creating a direct link to Ridge Hill from the Sprain Parkway.  Many people can support this solution in theory, but the obstacles to building it are significant. This is partly because the multimillion-dollar system of ramps and exits envisioned by the Yonkers City Council President, Chuck Lesnick, would have to cross a Westchester County park, and the county says it will sacrifice precious parkland to Ridge Hill at about the time hell freezes over.  In addition, the county has already raised serious questions about the scale and design of the so-called village, which it considers a closer cousin of a megamall. It insists further that offering a parkland boon to a private developer would set a catastrophic precedent with other builders and at other parks. The task force can lobby all it wants, the county says, but the Sprain Parkway ramps are roads to nowhere.  We love the idea of a regional task force -- of neighbors joining neighbors, crossing borders and putting heads together to solve development challenges that would otherwise lead to the usual endless and tiresome Westchester border wars.  But in the case of Ridge Hill, where so many problems could have been solved early on, with the City of Yonkers simply listening to its neighbors and working with Forest City Ratner to create a project on a more manageable scale, the great d\u00e9tente appears to have come too late.

                    "text": "  China and Russia vetoed an American-drafted resolution on Friday calling for the military rulers of Myanmar to release all political prisoners, cease attacks on ethnic minorities and speed a transition to democracy.  The vote was 9 to 3 with South Africa joining China and Russia in opposition, and three other countries, Congo Republic, Indonesia and Qatar, abstaining.  The Security Council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- hold veto power over most resolutions.  China and Russia argued that they shared concerns about conditions in Myanmar but considered them internal matters that did not constitute threats to international peace and security, the category of crisis subject to Security Council action.  ''Not a single one of the neighboring countries regards the situation in Myanmar as a threat to them, and on the basis of that, there were no grounds for the Security Council to consider the matter,'' said Vitaly I. Churkin, Russia's ambassador.  Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said, ''Of course there are problems in Myanmar, but we believe that these problems do not constitute a threat to international peace and security.''  Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting American ambassador, said he was ''deeply disappointed'' at the outcome but noted even countries voting against the measure made clear in explanatory statements that they were not defending Myanmar's government. ''This was a jurisdictional issue behind the split vote here,'' he said. ''There was no disagreement about the content and substance behind this resolution.''  Mr. Wolff was asked why the United States risked dividing the Council and muddling its message to the repressive rulers of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.  ''The only mixed message here is whether this issue deserved to be on the Security Council agenda,'' he said. ''There is no mixed message, no mixed signal at all, about how the international community, how this Council feels about the situation in Burma.''  The resolution mentioned by name the most prominent political prisoner, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader, who is under house arrest.  It also accused Myanmar's armed forces of attacking and raping civilians from the country's ethnic minorities and causing a refugee crisis in the region, enabling narcotics traffic and permitting international transmission of communicable diseases like H.I.V./AIDS and avian flu.  R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said he had no doubt that the abuses by Myanmar posed a threat beyond its borders. ''When a million people flee the country because of the abusive practices of the government, that's a threat to international peace and security,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington.  ''When you have a political movement jailed,'' he said, ''led by a woman who is one of the greatest people in the world, that's a threat to international peace and security.''  He dismissed suggestions that the proper United Nations forum for Myanmar was the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, not the Security Council. ''We forced this onto the agenda for one reason,'' he said. ''The Security Council is the only place that can deal with human rights. The Human Rights Council is a discredited institution. All it has done is to bash Israel; it has ignored North Korea, it has ignored Sudan and it has ignored Burma.''  After the vote, Kyaw Tint Swe, Myanmar's ambassador, thanked China and Russia for blocking the move and said the charges against his country in the resolution were ''patently false.''  The double veto was the first multiple veto in the Security Council since 1989, when Britain, France and the United States blocked a resolution on Panama.  ",

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  In her review of Robert Richardson's biography of William James (Dec. 17), Rebecca Newberger Goldstein misunderstands James's concept of ''the divided self,'' which is central to his interpretation of religion. Concerned to highlight the connection between James's personal experience and his philosophical views, she describes James as a ''deeply divided man'' because he wasted much time trying to decide what profession to pursue. She then claims that he defined the divided self as a ''technical term in psychology,'' implying that it means merely a self struggling to make a decision.  The fact is that the divided self is for James an essentially religious concept describing the inner turmoil and division so well expressed by the anguished words of St. Paul -- ''The good I would, I do not, and that I would not, that I do, O wretched man that I am.'' James rightly saw this as the confession of human sin, the conflict between the self that knows what ought to be done and the same self acknowledging its inability to do it. That the divided self had basically religious significance for James is shown in two of his other examples -- St. Augustine and John Bunyan -- each of whom has left us vivid accounts of his own grappling with the divided self that defines the human predicament in biblical religion.

                    "text": "  Sometimes I feel that living in New York City, having a good family and friends, and just being alive is a dream, that perhaps this second life of mine isn't really happening. Whenever I speak at the United Nations, Unicef or elsewhere to raise awareness of the continual and rampant recruitment of children in wars around the world, I come to realize that I still do not fully understand how I could have possibly survived the civil war in my country, Sierra Leone.  Most of my friends, after meeting the woman whom I think of as my new mother, a Brooklyn-born white Jewish-American, assume that I was either adopted at a very young age or that my mother married an African man. They would never imagine that I was 17 when I came to live with her and that I had been a child soldier and participated in one of the most brutal wars in recent history.  In early 1993, when I was 12, I was separated from my family as the Sierra Leone civil war, which began two years earlier, came into my life. The rebel army, known as the Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F.), attacked my town in the southern part of the country. I ran away, along paths and roads that were littered with dead bodies, some mutilated in ways so horrible that looking at them left a permanent scar on my memory. I ran for days, weeks and months, and I couldn't believe that the simple and precious world I had known, where nights were celebrated with storytelling and dancing and mornings greeted with the singing of birds and cock crows, was now a place where only guns spoke and sometimes it seemed even the sun hesitated to shine. After I discovered that my parents and two brothers had been killed, I felt even more lost and worthless in a world that had become pregnant with fear and suspicion as neighbor turned against neighbor and child against parent. Surviving each passing minute was nothing short of a miracle.  After almost a year of running, I, along with some friends I met along the way, arrived at an army base in the southeastern region. We thought we were now safe; little did we know what lay ahead.  1994: The First Battle  I have never been so afraid to go anywhere in my life as I was that first day. As we walked into the arms of the forest, tears began to form in my eyes, but I struggled to hide them and gripped my gun for comfort. We exhaled quietly, afraid that our own breathing could cause our deaths. The lieutenant led the line that I was in. He raised his fist in the air, and we stopped moving. Then he slowly brought it down, and we sat on one heel, our eyes surveying the forest. We began to move swiftly among the bushes until we came to the edge of a swamp, where we formed an ambush, aiming our guns into the bog. We lay flat on our stomachs and waited. I was lying next to my friend Josiah. At 11, he was even younger than I was. Musa, a friend my age, 13, was also nearby. I looked around to see if I could catch their eyes, but they were concentrating on the invisible target in the swamp. The tops of my eyes began to ache, and the pain slowly rose up to my head. My ears became warm, and tears were running down my cheeks, even though I wasn't crying. The veins on my arms stood out, and I could feel them pulsating as if they had begun to breathe of their own accord. We waited in the quiet, as hunters do. The silence tormented me.  The short trees in the swamp began to shake as the rebels made their way through them. They weren't yet visible, but the lieutenant had passed the word down through a whisper that was relayed like a row of falling dominos: ''Fire on my command.'' As we watched, a group of men dressed in civilian clothes emerged from under the tiny bushes. They waved their hands, and more fighters came out. Some were boys, as young as we were. They sat together in line, waving their hands, discussing a strategy. My lieutenant ordered a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) to be fired, but the commander of the rebels heard it as it whooshed its way out of the forest. ''Retreat!'' he called out to his men, and the grenade's blast got only a few rebels, whose split bodies flew in the air. The explosion was followed by an exchange of gunfire from both sides.  I lay there with my gun pointed in front of me, unable to shoot. My index finger became numb. I felt as if the forest had turned upside down and I was going to fall off, so I clutched the base of a tree with one hand. I couldn't think, but I could hear the sounds of the guns far away in the distance and the cries of people dying in pain. A splash of blood hit my face. In my reverie I had opened my mouth a bit, so I tasted some of the blood. As I spat it out and wiped it off my face, I saw the soldier it had come from. Blood poured out of the bullet holes in him like water rushing through newly opened tributaries. His eyes were wide open; he still held his gun. My eyes were fixed on him when I heard Josiah screaming for his mother in the most painfully piercing voice I had ever heard. It vibrated inside my head to the point that I felt my brain had shaken loose from its anchor.  I searched for Josiah. An RPG had tossed his tiny body off the ground, and he had landed on a tree stump. He wiggled his legs as his cry gradually came to an end. There was blood everywhere. It seemed as if bullets were falling into the forest from all angles. I crawled to Josiah and looked into his eyes. There were tears in them, and his lips were shaking, but he couldn't speak. As I watched him, the water in his eyes was replaced with blood that quickly turned his brown eyes red. He reached for my shoulder as if to pull himself up. But midway, he stopped moving. The gunshots faded in my head, and it was as if my heart had stopped and the whole world had come to a standstill. I covered his eyes with my fingers and lifted him from the tree stump. His backbone had been shattered. I placed him flat on the ground and picked up my gun. I didn't realize that I had stood up to take Josiah off the tree stump. I felt someone tugging at my foot. It was the corporal; he was saying something that I couldn't understand. His mouth moved, and he looked terrified. He pulled me down, and as I hit the ground, I felt my brain shaking in my skull again, and my deafness gave way.  ''Get down,'' he was screaming. ''Shoot,'' he said, as he crawled away from me to resume his position. As I looked to where he lay, my eyes caught Musa, whose head was covered with blood. His hands looked too relaxed. I turned toward the swamp, where there were gunmen running, trying to cross over. My face, my hands, my shirt and my gun were drenched in blood. I raised my gun and pulled the trigger, and I killed a man. Suddenly all the death I had seen since the day I was touched by war began flashing in my head. Every time I stopped shooting to change magazines and saw my two lifeless friends, I angrily pointed my gun into the swamp and killed more people. I shot everything that moved, until we were ordered to retreat because we needed another plan.  We took the guns and ammunition off the bodies of my friends and left them there in the forest, which had taken on a life of its own, as if it had trapped the souls that had departed from the dead. The branches of the trees seemed to be holding hands and bowing their heads in prayer. In the swamp, crabs had already begun feasting on the eyes of the dead. Limbs and fragmented skulls lay on top of the bog, and the water in the swamp was stagnant with blood. I was not afraid of these lifeless bodies. I despised them and kicked them to flip them and take their guns. I found a G3 and some ammunition. I noticed that most of the dead gunmen and boys wore lots of jewelry on their necks and wrists.  We arrived in the village, our base, with nightfall and sat against the walls of houses. It was quiet, and perhaps afraid of the silence, we began cleaning the blood off our guns, oiling their chambers, and shooting them into the air to test their effectiveness. I went for supper that night but was unable to eat. I only drank water and felt nothing. I lay on my back in the tent with my AK-47 on my chest and the G3 I had taken from a dead rebel leaning on the peg of the tent. Nothing happened in my head. It was a void, and I stared at the roof of the tent until I was miraculously able to doze off. I had a dream that I was picking up Josiah from the tree stump and a gunman stood on top of me. He placed his gun against my forehead. I immediately woke up from my dream and began shooting inside the tent, until the 30 rounds in the magazine were finished. The corporal and the lieutenant came in afterward and took me outside. I was sweating, and they threw water on my face and gave me a few white capsules. They were the same capsules that we'd all been given before we had gone into battle, and to this day, I do not know what they contained. I stayed up all night and couldn't sleep for days. We went out two more times that week, and I had no problem shooting my gun.  Rebel Raids  After that first week of going out on raids to kill people we deemed our rebel enemies or sympathizers of the rebels, our initiation was complete. We stayed put at the base, and we boys took turns guarding posts around the village. We smoked marijuana and sniffed ''brown brown,'' cocaine mixed with gunpowder, which was always spread out on a table near the ammunition hut, and of course I took more of the white capsules, as I had become addicted to them. The first time I took all these drugs at the same time, I began to perspire so much that I took off all my clothes. My body shook, my sight became blurred and I lost my hearing for several minutes. I walked around the village restlessly. But after several doses of these drugs, all I felt was numbness to everything and so much energy that I couldn't sleep for weeks. We watched war movies at night, Rambo ''First Blood,'' ''Rambo, First Blood, Part II,'' ''Commando'' and so on, with the aid of a generator or a car battery. We all wanted to be like Rambo; we couldn't wait to implement his techniques.  When we ran out of supplies, we raided rebel camps in towns, villages and forests. ''We have good news from our informants'' the lieutenant would announce. ''We are moving out in five minutes to kill some rebels and take their supplies, which really belong to us.'' He often made speeches about how we were defending our country, how honorable we were. At these times, I would stand holding my gun and feeling special because I was part of something that took me seriously and I was not running from anyone anymore. The lieutenant's face evinced confidence; his smiles disappeared before they were completed. We would tie our heads with the green cloths that distinguished us from the rebels, and we boys would lead the way. There were no maps and no questions asked. We were simply told to follow the path until we received instructions on what to do next. We walked for long hours and stopped only to eat sardines and corned beef with gari, sniff brown brown and take more white capsules. The combination of these drugs made us fierce. The idea of death didn't cross my mind, and killing had become as easy as drinking water. After that first killing, my mind had stopped making remorseful records, or so it seemed.  Before we got to a rebel camp, we would deviate from the path and walk in the forest. Once the camp was in sight, we would surround it and wait for the lieutenant's command. The rebels roamed about; some sat against walls, dozing off, and others, boys as young as we, stood at guard posts passing around marijuana. Whenever I looked at rebels during raids, my entire body shook with fury; they were the people who had shot my friends and family. So when the lieutenant gave orders, I shot as many as I could, but I didn't feel better. After every gunfight, we would enter the rebel camp, killing those we had wounded. We would then search the houses and gather gallons of gasoline, enormous amounts of marijuana and cocaine, bales of clothes, watches, rice, salt, gari and many other things. We rounded up any civilians -- men, women, boys and young girls -- hiding in the huts and houses and made them carry our loot back to the base. We shot them if they tried to run away.  On one of these raids, we captured a few rebels after a long gunfight and a lot of civilian casualties. We undressed the prisoners and tied their arms behind their backs until their chests were tight as drums. ''Where did you get all this ammunition from?'' the corporal asked one of the prisoners, a man with an almost dreadlocked beard. He spat in the corporal's face, and the corporal immediately shot him in the head at close range. He fell to the ground, and blood slowly leaked out of his head. We cheered in admiration of the corporal's action and saluted him as he walked by. Suddenly, a rebel hiding in the bushes shot one of our boys. We dispersed around the village in search of the shooter. When the young muscular rebel was captured, the lieutenant slit his neck with his bayonet. The rebel ran before he fell to the ground and stopped moving. We cheered again, raising our guns in the air, shouting and whistling.  During that time, a lot of things were done with no reason or explanation. Sometimes we were asked to leave for war in the middle of a movie. We would come back hours later after killing many people and continue the movie as if we had just returned from intermission. We were always either on the front lines, watching a war movie or doing drugs. There was no time to be alone or to think. When we conversed with one another, we talked only about the movies and how impressed we were with the way either the lieutenant, the corporal or one of us had killed someone. It was as if nothing else existed.  The villages that we captured and turned into our bases as we went along and the forests that we slept in became my home. My squad was my family, my gun was my provider and protector and my rule was to kill or be killed. The extent of my thoughts didn't go much beyond that. We had been fighting for more than two years, and killing had become a daily activity. I felt no pity for anyone. My childhood had gone by without my knowing, and it seemed as if my heart had frozen. I knew that day and night came and went because of the presence of the moon and the sun, but I had no idea whether it was a Sunday or a Friday.  Taken From the Front  In my head my life was normal. But everything began to change in January 1996. I was 15.  One morning that month, a truck came to the village where we were based. Four men dressed in clean blue jeans and white T-shirts that said ''Unicef'' in big blue letters jumped out. They were shown to the lieutenant's house. It seemed as if he had been expecting them. As they sat talking on the veranda, we watched them from under the mango tree, where we sat cleaning our guns. Soon all the boys were told to line up for the lieutenant who selected a few of us and asked the adult soldiers to take away our guns and ammunition. A bunch of boys, including my friend Alhaji and me, were ushered to the truck. I stared back at the veranda where the lieutenant now stood, looking in the other direction, toward the forest, his hands crossed behind his back. I still didn't know exactly what was going on, but I was beginning to get angry and anxious. Why had the lieutenant decided to give us up to these civilians? We thought that we were part of the war until the end.  We were on the road for hours. I had gotten used to always moving and hadn't sat in one place idly for a long time. It was night when the truck stopped at a center, where there were other boys whose appearances, red eyes and somber faces resembled ours. Alhaji and I looked at this group, and he asked the boys who they were. A boy who was sitting on the stoop angrily said: ''We fought for the R.U.F.; the army is the enemy. We fought for freedom, and the army killed my family and destroyed my village. I will kill any of those army bastards every time I get a chance to do so.'' The boy took off his shirt to fight, and on his arm was the R.U.F. brand. Mambu, one of the boys on our side, shouted, ''They are rebels,'' and reached for his bayonet, which he had hidden in his army shorts; most of us had hidden either a knife or a grenade before our guns were taken from us. Before Mambu could grab his weapon, the R.U.F. boy punched him in the face. He fell, and when he got up, his nose was bleeding. The rebel boys drew out the few bayonets they had in their shorts and rushed toward us. It was war all over again. Perhaps the na\u00efve men who had taken us to the center thought that removing us from the war would lessen our hatred for the R.U.F. It hadn't crossed their minds that a change of environment wouldn't immediately make us normal boys; we were dangerous, brainwashed to kill.  One boy grabbed my neck from behind. He was squeezing for the kill, and I couldn't use my bayonet effectively, so I elbowed him with all my might until he let go. He was holding his stomach when I turned around and stabbed him in his foot. The bayonet stuck, so I pulled it out with force. He fell, and I began kicking him in the face. As I went to deliver the final blow with my bayonet, someone came from behind me and sliced my hand with his knife. It was a rebel boy, and he was about to kick me down when he fell on his face. Alhaji had stabbed him in the back. He pulled the knife out, and we started kicking the boy until he stopped moving. I wasn't sure whether he was unconscious or dead. I didn't care. No one screamed or cried during the fight. After all, we had been doing such things for years and were all still on drugs.  We continued to stab and slice one another until a bunch of MPs came running through the gate toward the fight. The MPs fired a few rounds into the air to get us to stop, but we were still fighting, so they had to part us by force. They placed some of us at gunpoint and kicked others apart. Six people were killed: two on our side and four on the rebel side.  As MPs stood guard to make sure we didn't start another fight, we, the army boys, went to the kitchen to look for food. We ate and chatted about the fight. Mambu told us that he had plucked an eye out of the head of one of the R.U.F. boys, and that the boy ran to punch him, but he couldn't see, so he ran into the wall, banging his head hard and fainting. We laughed and picked up Mambu, raising him in the air. We needed the violence to cheer us after a whole day of boring travel and contemplation about why our superiors had let us go.  That night we were moved to a rehabilitation center called Benin Home. Benin Home was run by a local NGO called Children Associated With the War, in Kissy neighborhood, on the eastern outskirts of Freetown, the capital. This time, the MPs made sure to search us thoroughly before we entered. The blood of our victims and enemies was fresh on our arms and clothes. My lieutenant's words still echoed in my head: ''From now on, we kill any rebel we see, no prisoners.'' I smiled a bit, happy that we had taken care of the rebel boys, but I also began to wonder again: Why had we been taken here? I walked up and down on the veranda, restless in my new environment. My head began to hurt.  Relearning Boyhood  It was infuriating to be told what to do by civilians. Their voices, even when they called us for breakfast, enraged me so much that I would punch the wall, my locker or anything nearby. A few days earlier, we could have decided whether they would live or die.  We refused to do anything that we were asked to do, except eat. At the end of every meal, the staff members and nurses came to talk to us about attending the scheduled medical checkups and the one-on-one counseling sessions that we hated at the minihospital that was part of Benin Home. As soon as the live-in staff, mostly men, started telling us what to do, we would throw bowls, spoons, food and benches at them. We would chase them out of the dining hall and beat them. One afternoon, after we had chased off several staff members, we placed a bucket over the cook's head and pushed him around the kitchen until he burned his hand on a boiling pot and agreed to put more milk in our tea. During that same week, the drugs were wearing off. I craved cocaine and marijuana so badly that I would roll a plain sheet of paper and smoke it. Sometimes I searched the pockets of my army shorts, which I still wore, for crumbs of marijuana or cocaine. We broke into the minihospital and stole some painkillers -- white tablets and off-white -- and red and yellow capsules. We emptied the capsules, ground the tablets and mixed them together. But the mixture didn't give us the effect we wanted. We got more upset day by day and, as a result, resorted to more violence. We began to fight one another day and night. We would fight for hours for no reason at all. At first the staff would intervene, but after a while they just let us go. They couldn't really stop us, and perhaps they thought that we would get this out of our systems. During these fights, we destroyed most of the furniture and threw the mattresses out in the yard. We would stop to wipe the blood off our lips, arms and legs only when the bell rang for mealtime.  It had been more than a month, and some of us had almost gone through the withdrawal stage, even though there were still instances of vomiting and collapsing at unexpected moments. These outbreaks ended, for most of us, at the end of the second month. But we now had time to think; the fastened mantle of our war memories slowly began to open. We resorted to more violence to avoid summoning thoughts of our recent lives.  Whenever I turned on the faucet, all I could see was blood gushing out. I would stare at it until it looked like water before drinking or taking a shower. Boys sometimes ran out of the hall screaming, ''The rebels are coming.'' Other times, the younger ones sat weeping and telling us that nearby rocks were their dead families.  It took several months before I began to relearn how to sleep without the aid of medicine. But even when I was finally able to fall asleep, I would start awake less than an hour later. I would dream that a faceless gunman had tied me up and begun to slit my throat with the zigzag edge of his bayonet. I would feel the pain that the knife inflicted as the man sawed my neck. I'd wake up sweating and throwing punches in the air. I would run outside to the middle of the soccer field, sit on a stone and rock back and forth, my arms wrapped around my legs. I would try desperately to think about my childhood, but I couldn't. The fighting memories seemed to have formed a barrier that I had to break in order to think about any moment before the war. On those mornings, I would feel one of the staff members wrap a blanket around me, saying: ''This isn't your fault, you know. It really isn't. You'll get through this.'' He would then pull me up and walk me back to the hall.  Past and Present  One day after I'd been in Benin Home for more than three months, I was sent to the minihospital for a checkup. The nurse on duty was named Esther. I had met her once before when I was sent to the minihospital after cutting my hand punching a window. Esther wore a white uniform and a white hat. Her white teeth contrasted with her dark, shiny skin, and when she smiled, her face glowed. She was tall and had big brown eyes that were kind and inviting. She must have been about 30, which I thought was too old.  That day, before Esther examined me, she gave me a present, a Walkman and a Run-DMC tape. I used to listen to rap music a lot before the war and loved it because of its poetic use of words. I put the headphones on and didn't mind being examined because the song had taken hold of me, and I listened closely to every word. But when she began examining my legs and saw the nasty scars on my left shin, she took my headphones off and asked, ''How did you get these scars?''  ''Bullet wounds,'' I casually replied.  Her face filled with sorrow, and her voice was shaking when she spoke: ''You have to tell me what happened so I can prescribe treatment.'' At first I was reluctant, but she said she would be able to treat me effectively only if I told her what happened, especially about how my bullet wounds were treated. So I told her the whole story not because I really wanted to but because I thought that if I told her some of the truth of my war years, she would be afraid of me and would cease asking questions. She listened attentively when I began to talk:  During the second dry season of my war years, we were low on food and ammunition. So as usual, we decided to attack another village, which was a three-day walk away. We left our base that evening, stopping once a day to eat, drink and take drugs. Each of us had two guns, one strapped to our backs, the other held in our hands. On the evening of the third day, the village was in sight.  Surrounding it, we waited for the lieutenant's command. As we lay in ambush, we began to realize that the place was empty. We were beginning to suspect that something was amiss when a shot was fired from behind us. It was clear now: we were being ambushed. We ended up in a fight that lasted more than 24 hours. We lost several men and boys. When we finally seemed to have captured the village, we began to look around for anything we could find. I was filling my backpack with ammunition from a hut when bullets began to rain on the village again. I was hit three times in my left shin. The first two bullets went in and out, and the last one stayed inside. I couldn't walk, so I lay on the ground and released an entire round of the magazine into the bush where the bullets had come from. I remember feeling a tingle in my spine, but I was too drugged to really feel the pain, even though my leg had begun to swell. The sergeant doctor in my squad dragged me into one of the houses and tried to remove the bullet. Each time he raised his hands from my wound, I saw my blood all over his fingers. My eyes began to grow heavy, and I fainted.  I do not know what happened, but when I woke the next day, I felt as if I had nails hammered into the bones of my shin and my veins were being chiseled. I felt so much pain that I was unable to cry out loud; tears just fell from my eyes. The ceiling of the thatched-roof house where I was lying on a bed was blurry. My eyes struggled to become familiar with my surroundings. The gunfire had ceased and the village was quiet, so I assumed that the attackers had been successfully driven away. I felt a brief relief for that, but the pain in my leg returned. I tucked my lips in, closed my heavy eyelids and held tight to the edges of the wooden bed. I heard the footsteps of people entering the house. They stood by my bed, and as soon as they began to speak, I recognized their voices.  ''The boy is suffering, and we have no medicine here to lessen his pain. Everything is at our former base.'' The sergeant doctor sighed and continued. ''It will take six days to send someone to get the medicine and return. He will die from the pain by then.''  ''We have to send him to the former base, then,'' I heard my lieutenant saying. ''We need those provisions from that base, anyway. Do all you can to make sure that the boy stays alive,'' he said and walked out. ''Yes, sir,'' the sergeant doctor said. I slowly opened my eyes, and this time I could see clearly. I looked at his sweaty face and tried to smile a little. After having heard what they said, I swore to myself that I would fight hard and do anything for my squad after my leg was healed.  ''We will get you some help,'' the sergeant doctor said gently, sitting by my bed and examining my leg. ''Just be strong, young man,''  ''Yes, sir,'' I said, and tried to raise my hand to salute him, but he tenderly brought my arm down.  Two soldiers came into the house, took me off the bed, placed me in a hammock and carried me outside. The treetops of the village began to spin around as they carried me out. The journey felt as if it took a month. I fainted and awoke many times, and each time I opened my eyes, it seemed as if the voices of those who carried me were fading into the distance.  Finally we got to the base, and the sergeant doctor, who had come along, went to work on me. I was injected with something. I was given cocaine, which I frantically demanded. The doctor started operating on me before the drugs took effect. The other soldiers held my hands and stuffed a cloth into my mouth. The doctor stuck a crooked-looking scissorslike tool inside my wound and fished for the bullet. I could feel the edge of the metal inside me. My entire body was racked with pain.  Just when I thought I had had enough, the doctor abruptly pulled the bullet out. A piercing pain rushed up my spine from my waist to the back of my neck. I fainted.  When I regained consciousness, it was the morning of the next day, and the drugs had kicked in. I reached my hands down to my leg and felt the bandage before I stood up and limped outside, where some soldiers and the sergeant were sitting. ''Where is my weapon?'' I asked them. The sergeant handed me my G3, and I began cleaning it. I shot a couple of rounds sitting against a wall, ignoring the bandage on my leg and everyone else. I smoked marijuana, ate and snorted cocaine and brown brown. That was all I did for a few days before we went back to the new base we had captured. When we left, we threw kerosene on the thatched-roof houses, lighted them with matches and fired a couple of RPGs into the walls. We always destroyed the bases we abandoned so that rebel squads wouldn't be able to use them. Two soldiers carried me in the hammock, but this time I had my gun, and I looked left and right as we traveled the forest path.  At the new base, I stayed put for three weeks. Then one day, we heard that a rebel group was on its way to attack our village. I tightened the bandage around my shin, picked up my gun and followed my squad to ambush them. We killed most of the attackers and captured a few whom we brought back to base. ''These are the men responsible for the bullet holes in your leg. It's time to make sure they never shoot at you or your comrades.'' The lieutenant pointed at the prisoners. I was not sure if one of the captives was the shooter, but any captive would do at that time. They were all lined up, six of them, with their hands tied. I shot them in their shins and watched them suffer for an entire day before finally deciding to shoot them in the head so that they would stop crying. Before I shot each man, I looked at him and saw how his eyes gave up hope and steadied before I pulled the trigger. I found their somber eyes irritating.  When I finished telling Esther the story, she had tears in her eyes, and she couldn't decide whether to rub my head, a traditional gesture indicating that things would be well, or hug me. In the end she did neither but said: ''None of what happened was your fault. You were just a little boy, and anytime you want to tell me anything, I am here to listen.'' She stared at me, trying to catch my eye so she could assure me of what she had just said. I became angry and regretted that I had told someone, a civilian, about my experience. I hated the ''It is not your fault'' line that all the staff members said every time anyone spoke about the war.  I got up, and as I started walking out of the hospital, Esther said, ''I will arrange a full checkup for you.'' She paused and then continued: ''Let me keep the Walkman. You don't want the others to envy you and steal it. I will be here every day, so you can come and listen to it anytime.'' I threw the Walkman at her and left, putting my fingers in my ears so I couldn't hear her say, ''It is not your fault.''  After that, whenever Esther would see me around, she'd smile and ask me how I was doing. At first I detested her intrusions. But slowly I came to appreciate them, even looked forward to them. It was like this at the center; most boys found a staff member whom they eventually began to trust. Mine was Esther.  Over the next few months, I started to visit Esther occasionally at the minihospital, which was just across the dirt road from the dorm that I shared with more than 35 boys. During that time, Esther got me to tell her some of my dreams. She would just listen and sit quietly with me. If she wanted to say anything, she would first ask, ''Would you like me to say something about your dream?'' Mostly I would say no and ask for the Walkman.  One day Esther gave me a Bob Marley tape and a really nice notebook and pen and suggested that I use them to write the lyrics of the songs and that we could learn them together. After that I visited Esther at the minihospital every day, to show her what I had written. I would sing her the parts of songs I had memorized. Memorizing lyrics left me little time to think about what happened in the war. As I grew comfortable with Esther, I talked to her mainly about Bob Marley's lyrics and Run-DMC's too. She mostly listened.  One night, close to my fifth month at the center, I fell asleep while reading the lyrics of a song. I startled awake after having a dream that involved lots of people stabbing and shooting one another, and I felt all their pain. The room I stood in filled with their blood. In the dream, I then went outside to sit at dinner with my father, mother and two brothers. They didn't seem to notice that I was covered with blood.  It was the first time I dreamed of my family since I started running away from the war. The next afternoon I went to see Esther, and she could tell that something was bothering me. ''Do you want to lie down?'' she asked, almost whispering.  ''I had this dream last night,'' I said looking away. ''I don't know what to make of it.''  She came and sat next to me and asked, ''Would you like to tell me about it?'' I didn't reply.  ''Or just talk about it out loud and pretend I am not here. I won't say anything. Only if you ask me.'' She sat quietly beside me. The quietness lasted for a while, and for some reason I began to tell her my dream.  At first she just listened to me, and then gradually she started asking questions to make me talk about the lives I had lived before and during the war. ''None of these things are your fault,'' she said, as she had repeated sternly at the end of every conversation. Even though I had heard that phrase from every staff member -- and had always hated it -- I began that day to believe it. That didn't make me immune to the guilt that I felt for what I had done. But it somehow lightened my burdensome memories and gave me strength to think about things. The more I spoke about my experiences to Esther, the more I began to cringe at the gruesome details, even though I didn't let her know that. I still didn't completely trust her. I only liked talking to her because I felt that she didn't judge me for what I had been a part of; she looked at me with the inviting eyes and welcoming smile that said I was still a child.  One day during my fifth month at Benin Home, I was sitting on a rock behind the classrooms when Esther came by. She sat next to me without uttering a word. She had my lyrics notebook in her hand. ''I feel as if there is nothing left for me to be alive for,'' I said slowly. ''I have no family, it is just me. No one will be able to tell stories about my childhood.'' I sniffled a bit.  Esther put her arms around me and pulled me closer to her. She shook me to get my full attention before she started. ''Think of me as your family, your sister.''  ''But I didn't have a sister,'' I replied.  ''Well, now you do,'' she said. ''You see, this is the beauty of starting a new family. You can have different kinds of family members.'' She looked at me directly, waiting for me to say something.  ''O.K., you can be my sister -- temporarily.'' I emphasized the last word.  ''That is fine with me. So will you come to see your temporary sister tomorrow, please?'' She covered her face as if she would be sad if I said no.  ''O.K., O.K., no need to be sad,'' I said, and we both laughed a bit.  Rejoining the Civilian World  Soon after, a group of visitors from the European Union, the United Nations, Unicef and several NGOs arrived at the center in a convoy of cars. At the request of the staff, we boys had prepared a talent show for them. I read a monologue from ''Julius Caesar'' and performed a short hip-hop play about the redemption of a former child soldier that I had written with Esther's encouragement. After that event, the head of the center asked me to be the spokesman for Benin Home and to speak about my experiences.  I was at the beginning of my seventh month at Benin Home when one of the field agents, Leslie, came to tell me that he was responsible for ''repatriating'' me -- the term used to describe the process of reuniting ex-child soldiers with their former communities. My family was dead, but I knew that my father had a brother whom I had never met who lived somewhere in Freetown. Leslie said he would try to find him, and if he couldn't, he'd find me a foster family to live with.  One Saturday afternoon about two weeks later, as I chatted with Esther at the minihospital, Leslie walked in, smiling widely. ''What is the good news?'' Esther asked. Leslie examined my curious face, then walked back to the door and opened it. A tall man walked in.  ''This is your uncle,'' Leslie proudly announced.  The man walked over to where I was sitting. He bent over and embraced me long and hard. My arms hung loose at my sides.  What if he is just some man pretending to be my uncle? I thought. The man let go of me. He was crying, which is when I began to believe that he was really my family, because men in Sierra Leone rarely cried.  He crouched on his heels next to me and began: ''I am sorry I never came to see you all those years. I wish I had met you before today. But we can't go back now. We just have to start from here. I am sorry for your losses.'' He looked at Leslie and continued: ''After you are done here, you can come and live with me and my family. You are my son. I don't have much, but I will give you a place to sleep, food and my love.'' He put his arms around me.  No one had called me ''son'' in a very long time. I didn't know what to say. Everyone, it seemed, was waiting for my response. I turned to my uncle, smiled at him and said: ''Thank you for coming to see me. I really appreciate that you have offered me to stay with you. But I don't even know you.'' I put my head down.  ''As I said, we cannot go back,'' he replied, rubbing my head and laughing a little. ''But we can start from here. I am your family, and that is enough for us to begin liking each other.''  I got up and hugged my uncle, and he embraced me harder than he had the first time and kissed me on my forehead. We briefly stood in silence before he began to speak again. ''I will visit you every weekend. And if it is O.K., I would like you to come home with me at some point, to see where I live and to meet my wife and children -- your family.'' My uncle's voice trembled; he was trying to hold back sobs. He rubbed my head with one hand and shook Leslie's hand with the other.  As my uncle promised, he came to visit every weekend. We would take long walks together, and they gave me a chance to get to know him. He told me about what my father was like when he was a child, and I told him about my childhood. I needed to talk about those good times before the war. But the more I heard and talked about my father, the more I missed my mother and brothers too.  About a month or so later at Benin Home, Leslie told me it was time for me to go live with my uncle. I was happy, but I was also worried about living with a family. I had been on my own for years and had taken care of myself without any guidance from anyone. If I distanced myself from the family, I was afraid that I might look ungrateful to my uncle, who didn't have to take me in; I was worried about what would happen when my nightmares took hold of me. How was I going to explain my sadness, which I was unable to hide when it took over my face, to my new family, especially the children?  I lay in my bed night after night staring at the ceiling and thinking, Why have I survived the war? Why was I the last person in my immediate family to be alive? I went to see Esther every day, though, and would say hello, ask how she was and then get lost in my own head thinking about what life was going to be like after the center. At night, I sat quietly on the veranda with my friends. I wouldn't notice when they left the bench that we all sat on.  When the day of my repatriation finally came, I walked to the minihospital building where I was to wait, my heart beating very fast. My friends Alhaji and Mambu and a boy named Mohamed were sitting on the front steps, and Esther emerged, smiling. Leslie sat in a nearby van waiting to take me to my new home.  ''I have to go,'' I said to everyone, my voice shaking. I extended my hand to Mohamed, but instead of shaking it, he leapt up and hugged me. Mambu embraced me while Mohamed was still holding me. He squeezed me hard, as if he knew it was goodbye forever. (After I left the center, Mambu's family refused to take him in, and he ended up back on the front lines.) At the end of the hug, Alhaji shook hands with me. We squeezed each other's hands and stared into each other's eyes, remembering all that we had been through. I never saw him again, since he continually moved from one foster home to another. Esther stepped forward, her eyes watery. She hugged me tighter than she ever had. I didn't return her hug very well, as I was busy trying to hold back my tears. After she let go, she gave me a piece of paper. ''This is my address,'' she said. ''Come by anytime.''  I went to Esther's home several weeks after that. But my timing wasn't good. She was on her way to work. She hugged me, and this time I squeezed back; this made her laugh after we stood apart. She looked me straight in the eyes. ''Come and see me next weekend so we can have more time to catch up, O.K.?'' she said. She was wearing her white uniform and was on her way to take on other traumatized children. It must be tough living with so many war stories. I was living with just one, mine, and it was difficult. Why does she do it? Why do they all do it? I thought as we went our separate ways. It was the last time I saw her. I loved her but never told her.

                    "text": "  THE wooden canoe, a curiara in the language of my Pem\u00f3n Indian guides, winds through the rapids of the Carrao River in southeast Venezuela. A drizzle lets up as the sun rises, revealing the misty escarpments of Auyan-tepui. Then, abruptly, the tepui -- a Pem\u00f3n word for the majestic sandstone mountains in this wide swath of jungle and savanna -- comes into magnificent relief. It is easily one of the most impressive sights I've ever encountered.  But the best part is yet to come: Angel Falls, the world's tallest waterfall at 3,212 feet (almost 20 times the height of Niagara Falls), named in honor of Jimmie Angel, the Missouri-born bush pilot who crash-landed his turboprop nearby in an ill-fated search for gold in the 1930's. Though the Pem\u00f3n Indians were surely among the first to contemplate the waterfall, the name Angel Falls stuck after word of the arduous 11-day trek of Angel's traveling party reached the outside world. By 1949, the American photojournalist Ruth Robertson had measured Angel Falls for an expedition described in National Geographic, cementing the mystique of Venezuela's tepui country.  Venezuela has done little to develop this corner of Bol\u00edvar State, and the flight from Puerto Ordaz, over thick jungle and sinewy rivers, to Canaima, an asphalt strip and collection of thatched huts that passes for an airport, attests to the region's remoteness.  ''I might have one of the most rewarding jobs in the world,'' said Laszlo Miszlai, 36, the Venezuelan pilot of the Cessna Grand Caravan that swooped in for a dramatic view of Angel Falls before we landed. ''I not only get to fly over the falls almost every day, but I get to see the awed expressions of our passengers.''  Beyond the polarizing political theater that defines Venezuela these days are places of intense beauty, from deserted Caribbean beaches to snow-capped peaks. Angel Falls, in the heart of Canaima National Park, a protected reserve about the size of Belgium, may top them all.  Geography unique to Venezuela made the surreal setting around Angel Falls possible. There are dozens of tepuis (pronounced tey-POO-ees) in this region, remnants of what geologists believe were the mountains of the ancient supercontinent known as Gondwana. Some of these isolated mesas are two billion years old, preserving an array of unique plant and animal life that rivals that of places like the Gal\u00e1pagos.  ''Think of each of these mountains like an island surrounded by forest,'' said Charles Brewer-Car\u00edas, a Caracas-based naturalist and explorer who is an eminent expert on Auyan-tepui and the country's other mesas.  ''Some birds cannot fly from one tepui to another because of the distances involved,'' added Mr. Brewer-Car\u00edas, who described a family of flowering plants found near Angel Falls that is related to plants in Madagascar, another long-isolated portion of Gondwana, which once included Africa, Antarctica, South America, Australia and the Indian subcontinent, among other land masses.  ''Each tepui has characteristics that give us a window into what the world was like more than a billion years ago,'' said Mr. Brewer-Car\u00edas.  When I arrived in Canaima in early October near the end of the rainy season, I found myself contemplating a more recent time -- the year 1956. That was when Rudolf Truffino Van Der Lugt, a Dutch adventurer and hotelier, arrived in Canaima to scout out locations for a lodge after working for a spell at the Hotel Tamanaco in Caracas.  He called his establishment -- a series of thatched-roof buildings and a bamboo bar -- Campamento Ucaima and became known as Jungle Rudy, the go-to guy for anyone planning an expedition to Angel Falls. In the '50s, ''almost nothing was known about the area,'' the Dutch writer Jan Brokken wrote in his 2004 biography, ''Jungle Rudy.'' Numerous lodges cater to travelers who come to Canaima for a glimpse of Angel Falls, but Campamento Ucaima has the grandest and most eccentric past. It still feels like an isolated outpost when the fog rolls in off Auyan-tepui. Though accessible only by canoe from Canaima, Ucaima has its small luxuries, among them a drink made with Venezuela's delicious Santa Teresa rum and papaya juice, which was handed to me as soon as I arrived.  I gazed around at the spartan world Rudy Truffino had created: hammocks slung on the porches of bungalows; canoes docked in a small river port; a staff chatting in a patois of Pem\u00f3n and Spanish. Some leather-bound notebooks contained decades-old clippings of Truffino's Mosquito Coast-esque trajectory into this jungle after leaving post-war Europe.  Truffino died in 1994, and his lodge is now run by his daughters, who appear as children in a black-and-white photo in Ucaima's bar with their Austrian mother and their father, who is petting a capybara, a large rodent. A guide named Yosmary L\u00f3pez proudly told me that the lodge had been host to Prince Charles, Neil Armstrong and the German filmmaker Werner Herzog.  I gulped down the welcome cocktail and Ms. L\u00f3pez shepherded me and a few other arrivals into a canoe for an excursion to Salto Sapo, or Frog Falls. The 20-minute ride upriver and the one-and-a-half-hour hike through thick rain forest and lighter savanna vegetation was a warm-up for the following day when we would ascend to the foot of Angel Falls.  Near Salto Sapo, Ms. L\u00f3pez, who was taking a sojourn from her university studies in western Venezuela, plucked a yellow flower from the ground that was a little larger than a pinhead. ''It's the smallest orchid in the world,'' she said. I had no way of confirming this information, but I marveled at the intricacy of the tiny orchid and the geologic isolation that had made its evolution possible.  WE were drenched as we navigated a narrow rock pathway under Salto Sapo's curtain of water, holding on to a withering length of rope; when we emerged on the other side of the waterfall we could see a group of Pem\u00f3nes playing soccer on a sandy spot.  By the time we hiked down to the impromptu soccer field they were gone, so we jumped into the water for a swim. Rain started falling and I was surprised by the orange, tannin-tinted color of the river water. In the distance, two other mesas, Kur\u00fan-tepui and Kusari-tepui, soared above the savanna and jungle.  The remoteness of this region has kept it relatively pristine; it is still impossible to travel by car through most of Canaima National Park because there are almost no roads. Airstrips built by Capuchin missionaries allow limited travel in small planes. Canoeing or hiking are the most common ways of getting around.  I got a taste of both methods the next morning with Leomar Jaramillo, a Pem\u00f3n guide who grew up in the village of Santa Marta near Angel Falls. With Auyan-tepui still sheathed in darkness, we set out in a motorized curiara for the four-hour trip to the base of the waterfall.  Mr. Jaramillo, 22, maneuvered the canoe upriver against the rapids with amazing deftness before arriving at a camping site and lookout point where we could view Angel Falls in the distance. I had never been a huge fan of waterfalls before, but even from this distance, the falls, which shoot water over the top of Auyan-tepui in a ''V'' formation, were breathtaking.  We had a brief breakfast of arepas, the white corn cakes that are a staple throughout Venezuela, then set out on a smooth sandy path that led into thick jungle. Early on, we came upon a small coral snake, at which Mr. Jaramillo shrugged and said was deadly. Then we proceeded up the tepui, stopping occasionally to peek at the falls through the trees or gulp down some water.  The path in some stretches was completely overgrown with trees, reminding me how oppressively dark the jungle can be, and I wondered what it was like for Jimmie Angel when he descended Auyan-tepui without any way of reaching the outside world  Slowly, I ascended the tepui, grasping parts of tree trunks and branches to gain balance on the slippery mud and stones. Ahead, Mr. Jaramillo blissfully jogged up the path as if he were strolling on the savanna. Little by little, the thick trees above us began letting in more sunlight, raising the temperature to greenhouse levels. We glimpsed Auyan-tepui's stone escarpment and, finally, the water falling more than 3,000 feet from the top of the soaring mesa.  But we still had about an hour to go before we arrived at Angel Falls. When we finally got there, the pool of cool water at the base of the falls was a welcome sight. I dove in, doing a backstroke as I gazed up at a cascade of water that doesn't so much crash as separate into smaller falls and showers of mist as it descends in seemingly slow-motion. There were no souvenir stands or snack bars here, just a few boulders to sit on. All around us was dense green jungle, accentuating the isolation and benign neglect that has thus far prevented this place from turning into an easily accessible tourist destination.  A retired oil executive who made the trek to the base of Angel Falls with his wife and his teenage daughter were the only other Americans I encountered. A sprinkling of other nationalities was there, some Italians, Spaniards and a Serb. Some Venezuelans were there, too, lugging a bottle of Scotch whiskey and a bucket of ice.  Eventually, we hiked down the tepui back to the lookout point, where our guides prepared a lunch of chicken roasted on a spit over an open fire, accompanied by casabe, a hard bread made from manioc.  Later, in the canoe back to Ucaima, I stole a last glance at Angel Falls. I had gotten a taste of Venezuela's legendary lost world and now I wanted more.  VISITING A PREHISTORIC WORLD  GETTING THERE  Venezuelan airlines fly round-trip from Caracas to Puerto Ordaz daily, with the one-hour flight costing about $170 (prices for flights, lodging and other services below are in United States dollars). Charter companies and Servicios A\u00e9reos Mineros, or Serami, a small private carrier, make the one-hour trip from Puerto Ordaz to Canaima each day for about $240 round trip, according to Akanan Tours, a Caracas-based company that arranges flights, lodging and hiking excursions in Canaima National Park (58-212-264-2769, www.akanan.com). The trip on Serami's propeller plane includes a fly-over of Angel Falls close enough to remind you of Jimmie Angel's bravado in landing his Flamingo airplane atop Auyan-tepui in 1937.  The rainy season, from May to December, offers some of the better conditions for canoe trips with guides who take travelers by river relatively close to the foot of Angel Falls. Hotels and airlines commonly quote their prices in United States dollars to foreign visitors.  WHERE TO STAY  Most of the lodges and small hotels known as ''camps'' offer packages that include all meals and lodging. Alcoholic drinks are often charged separately.  The most intriguing place to stay around Angel Falls is Campamento Ucaima, founded by the Dutch hotelier and adventurer Rudy Truffino in the 1950s. Also known as Jungle Rudy's, its 14 rooms and thatched-hut bar feel like a placid outpost of civilization along the Carrao River. Meals are served in an open-air dining room where visitors can gaze at the sun rising above the thick jungle. Rates are about $220 per person for a spartan room with a shower, bed and a hammock on the porch. (58-286-962-2359; www.junglerudy.com).  Campamento Canaima is a modern hotel near the edge of a lagoon with the luxury of a strip of white sand beach. With 109 rooms largely in the form of yellow bungalows, Canaima has a multilingual staff and rates of about $187 a night (58-212-976-0530).  EXPLORER | ANGEL FALLS  Correction:  January 28, 2007, Sunday  The Explorer column on Jan. 14 about Angel Falls in Venezuela, misidentified the type of airplane flown by Jimmie Angel, who survived a crash landing there in the 1930s. It was a radial-engine monoplane -- not a turboprop, which was not developed until the 1940s.  ",

                    "text": "  On consecutive nights, the Nets have shown that resiliency and effort are slowly finding places in their team persona. But they are still learning how to catch a winning attitude.  After trailing by 16 points in the first half and by 8 in the third quarter against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night, the Nets battled back in the fourth, only to watch the game slip from their grasp in the closing minutes.  With a 96-91 loss to the Cavaliers, the Nets had their season-long winning streak of three games snapped, and they missed an opportunity to beat two of the Eastern Conference's best teams on consecutive nights.  On Friday night, the Nets overcame an 18-0 deficit to start the game against the Chicago Bulls and executed to perfection down the stretch to win by 5 points at Continental Arena.  After Saturday night's game here, Nets point guard Jason Kidd said: ''There were six minutes left and the momentum was in our favor, and we turned the ball over and took some bad shots. It was kind of the opposite of what we did last night.''  Still, Kidd echoed the sentiments of several of his teammates that the Nets (14-19), who have limped to one of the most disappointing starts in the National Basketball Association, finally have something to feel good about.  ''The effort was there,'' he said. ''And if we can build on what we've done the last four games in the sense of playing hard, we'll hopefully be in the win column more.''  Kidd, who had 11 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists, said he was playing with a stiff back that he had hurt against the Bulls.  The Nets held LeBron James to a quiet 19 points and forced him into 5 turnovers. But the Cavaliers' frontcourt of Drew Gooden (21 points, 6 offensive rebounds) and Zydrunas Ilgauskas (16 points), along with guard Larry Hughes (21 points), picked up much of the slack.  The Nets' frontline was again depleted because their starting power forward, Jason Collins, missed his second consecutive game with a strained lower back. The reserve forward Josh Boone was also out of the game because of a migraine.  Yet the Nets got another impressive performance from center Mikki Moore, who has been shifted into the starting lineup because of the season-ending injury to Nenad Krstic. Moore scored 18 points and grabbed 10 rebounds.  Moore and a couple of his fellow role players opened the fourth quarter on a 14-4 run that turned a 6-point deficit into a 4-point lead.  The rookie point guard Marcus Williams led like a veteran during that stretch, getting a couple of open jump shots on pick-and-roll plays. He helped cap the run by finding his fellow rookie teammate Hassan Adams with a lob pass for an emphatic dunk.  ''Those guys did a very good job to get us in that position,'' Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said. ''In the last seven minutes, unfortunately, it was a combination of lack of ability to get defensive stops and lack of ability to score down the stretch, obviously, that determined the outcome of the game.''  With the score tied at 83-83, Ilagauskas got an open dunk courtesy of a pass from James. Kidd lost the ball on his team's next possession, eventually leading to a reverse dunk by James. Two possessions later, Gooden scored on a driving two-handed dunk. Moments later, Hughes all but sealed the game for the Cavaliers with a layup.  ''The last six minutes, we pride ourselves in trying to out-execute teams, and we did it for maybe five minutes,'' said Vince Carter, who scored 18 points.  One encouraging sign for the Nets was the play of small forward Richard Jefferson, who finished with 17 points. Jefferson has struggled this season because of injuries to both ankles, and many people within the Nets' organization have cited his lack of explosiveness as a direct reason for the team's problems.  During the Nets' three-game winning streak, Jefferson shot 56.4 percent from the field and averaged 21 points, both well above his season averages.  Power forward Cliff Robinson, who was playing in only his second game Saturday night after missing a month and a half because of an injured left knee, pointed to another possibility for the Nets' early struggles: a lack of accountability.  Robinson, 40, is the longest-tenured player in the N.B.A., and one of the few Nets willing to correct his teammates when they do something wrong.  ''You're not out there to step on anyone's toes or hurt anyone's feelings,'' he said before the game. ''But at the same time, if you can't take constructive criticism, you're in the wrong business.''  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

No team with a record as bad as the Saints' 3-13 last season had ever made the conference championship the next season. But here are the Saints, and, tailback Deuce McAllister said, ''This may be destiny.''  It may be many things, but two stand out:  Can the Bears' celebrated defense rise from the doldrums and handle McAllister, quarterback Drew Brees, the all-around threat Reggie Bush and those dangerous receivers?  Which Rex Grossman will show up at quarterback for the Bears?  Last week, Grossman was mostly good in an overtime victory against the Seahawks, and the Saints' secondary has been vulnerable to the long pass. Grossman was erratic during the regular season, with 23 touchdown passes and 20 interceptions. ''What's important is those players have a belief in him,'' Saints Coach Sean Payton said.  Although the Bears' defense has lost some of its dominance because of injuries, linebacker Lance Briggs said, ''We tweak a little, we're right back where we were.''  The Bears will have an advantage from a home crowd, and Chicago weather in January can be shocking to a dome team from a warm-weather city.  Reporter's Pick: Saints  New England (14-4) at Indianapolis (14-4)  6:30 p.m., CBS  History favors the Patriots. They have won three of the last five Super Bowls, Coach Bill Belichick is 13-2 in playoff games and quarterback Tom Brady is 12-1. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is 4-10 against the Patriots. In two playoff games this season, he has thrown one touchdown pass and five interceptions.  Or maybe history will favor the Colts in the American Football Conference title game. They beat the Patriots 11 weeks ago, when Brady threw four interceptions, and he threw three last week against the Chargers.  Still, the Patriots have won five straight games, and they always seem to come up with defensive innovations. They will need offensive fire because the Colts, who have suffered on defense all season, have turned into a defensive power.  Reporter's Pick: Patriots  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

Consider the various sorts of pet therapy, or studies that suggest that a nuzzle from a dog can lower blood pressure or even nudge someone out of a coma. Some surveys have found that people who have pets report fewer doctor visits and better mental health. Even longer survival after heart attacks has been reported.  And dog-walking must provide exercise and all the benefits that come with it. It only stands to reason that pet owners should be healthier than others. Doesn't it?  Well, not in Finland. Leena K. Koivusilta and Ansa Ojanlatva, two researchers at the University of Turku, looked through data collected in a health survey of 21,101 Finns. Among the questions the participants were asked was whether they owned pets.  No matter how the researchers sliced the data, they found that the pet owners looked, if anything, sicker than pet-free people. Pet owners were more likely to suffer from illnesses that included high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers, depression and kidney disease. They smoked more (though drank less) than people who did not own pets.  They were also fatter, particularly the dog owners, the researchers reported in the current issue of the journal PLoS ONE.  That does not mean pets induce disease. At least in Finland, pet owners tended to be poorer, less educated and older, and those factors, rather than pets, probably explain the health disparity.  Nor does it mean that pets aren't good for you. It's just that the benefits may not be medical.  KENNETH CHANG  FINDINGS  ",

                    "text": "  Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur has seen almost everything, but the 856th game of his N.H.L. career was different. On Saturday night, he could not recall allowing a game-tying goal with seven-tenths of a second left in regulation.  The Devils wound up beating the Islanders, 2-1, when center Scott Gomez knocked a shot past Islanders goaltender Rick DiPietro with 1 minute 20 seconds remaining in overtime. The Devils' captain, Patrik Elias, set up the play, intercepting the puck and slipping a pass to Gomez.  It was a gorgeous goal, but it was not the most memorable one in a tense, thrilling duel between Brodeur and DiPietro. With DiPietro on the bench and the Devils' Brian Rafalski in the penalty box in the final moments of regulation, Islanders right wing Miroslav Satan scored to force overtime.  The sellout crowd of 16,234 at Nassau Coliseum roared. Brodeur lost what would have been his 8th shutout of the season and 88th of his career. He remembered allowing a similar goal at Montreal early in his career, but that was with two or three seconds left.  ''I don't think they had tenths of a second on the clock then,'' Brodeur said, smiling.  He could smile because the Devils (27-14-4) rescued him. John Madden, who scored what seemed to be the winning goal with 1:18 left in regulation, said the Devils chose to shrug off Satan's goal and play on.  ''I really like that about this team,'' he said. ''Nothing was said. We were ready to play overtime.''  In overtime, each team has four skaters, instead of the usual five, allowing Elias's creativity to become even more apparent. With Elias and Gomez forechecking fiercely, Elias guessed where the puck might be going. It ended up on his stick.  ''I really had nothing to shoot at, and I didn't see anything there,'' Elias said. ''Scotty got open, and it worked out.''  Elias tapped a short pass to Gomez, who rapped in his eighth goal of the season, and his second in two nights.  The Devils have won three straight against the Islanders (21-19-4), all in the last two weeks. Saturday's game had the feel of a playoff game, especially because the goalies stopped almost everything, sometimes acrobatically. Brodeur finished with 27 saves and DiPietro made 28.  ''It was just kind of playing chess,'' Islanders Coach Ted Nolan said.  Late in regulation, Madden took a drop pass from Sergei Brylin and fired a shot over DiPietro's glove that hit the top left corner of the net.  ''I just don't think he saw the shot,'' Madden said.  Midway through the third period, Brodeur tried leaping to snare a sailing puck before Satan got to it, but was knocked down instead. Play continued, and Brodeur made a sprawling pad save to keep the Islanders from scoring.  But with less than a second left, Brodeur did not move his left leg fast enough to stop a shot by Satan. The Devils knew better than to lose faith in him. ''You got the best goaltender in the world,'' Gomez said, ''so we thought, 'Let's win it in overtime.' ''  HOCKEY  ",

                    "text": "  Moving It All To Vista  Q. When the time comes, how can I move all of my bookmarks, music and other files from my old computer to a new Windows Vista PC?  A. Windows Vista, scheduled for its debut to the general public next week, includes a free tool called Windows Easy Transfer. Like the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard that came with Windows XP, it is designed to move most of your personal stuff by means of a cable connection between old and new machines. Moving files over a network or with recordable discs and drives are other methods for transferring your files to the Vista PC as well.  According to Microsoft's own description of Windows Easy Transfer (found at support.microsoft.com/kb/928635), the tool can move your user accounts and settings, personal files and folders, e-mail settings, messages and contacts, Internet settings and bookmarks and all your digital music, picture and video files.  It won't move system files like fonts and drivers, however, so you will need to reinstall any custom fonts and Vista-compatible drivers on the new machine yourself.  While Windows Easy Transfer will move program settings and preferences if you have the same programs installed on the new computer, it won't move the programs themselves. (Some types of software, like security programs designed for older versions of Windows, will probably not work on Vista anyway.)  Unfortunately for those with older computers, Windows Easy Transfer is designed to transfer files and settings from older machines running Windows 2000 or later. For Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me and Windows NT users who don't want to move data and reconfigure all their program settings manually, separate software can be a much easier solution.  Several data-migration programs can be found around the Web or in computer stores. For example, Laplink PCmover (www.laplink.com) works with most older versions of Windows, costs less than $60 and is designed to move your files and settings between machines. Laplink PCmover even promises to move your programs as well.  Leaping To Linux  Q. What type of computers can run the Ubuntu Linux system?  A. Ubuntu, a free and flexible version of the Linux operating system, can work on many kinds of computers, including PCs and Macintosh machines with Intel processors. PC hardware with A.M.D. processors and Macs with the older PowerPC chips can also run Ubuntu, as can some high-end workstations and servers used by computer professionals. ''Ubuntu,'' a Zulu and Xhosa word from South Africa, roughly translates to ''humanity to others.''  Because it often has less-demanding hardware requirements than the latest versions of Windows or the Mac operating system, many people have found installing Linux on an older computer can give it a few more years of usefulness.  The standard desktop version of Ubuntu Linux includes a point-and-click graphical interface and programs for word processing, e-mail, Web browsing and other typical tasks. The system can be downloaded free at www.ubuntu.com, where there is much more information on installing and using it.  The Longevity Of Mail Accounts  Q. How long can you go without logging into Yahoo Mail before your account is shut down?  A. Free Web-based e-mail services like Yahoo Mail, MSN Hotmail and Google Gmail now offer at least a gigabyte of mail storage, but you do need to log in every once in awhile to keep the account active. The exact length of time may vary by company, and you should check with your particular mail service for specific details.  In the case of Yahoo, its Web site states that you need to check in at least once every four months before your free account expires. People who pay $20 a year for the premium service, Yahoo Mail Plus, do not have to worry about their accounts expiring. (Yahoo Mail Plus subscribers get more mailbox space, no advertisements on their messages, better spam filters and other perks.)  An account with Microsoft's MSN Hotmail service may expire if not checked at least every 30 days. If you do not log into a Gmail account for an extended period of time, Google will mark your account as dormant and may delete the entire thing after nine months if you have not used it.  J. D.

The difference between high-powered high schools like those mentioned in the article (merely 68 schools supplied over 20 percent of Yale's 2006 freshman class) and mine, where the college counselor had not heard of the top-ranked liberal arts colleges where I applied, is not academic; it's social.  Many classmates from schools like Andover and Dalton arrive at college fighting to get into the most selective major and singing group and, later, the best law school and investment bank -- realms that preserve the ''I'll take you down'' moral certitude they learned in high school. That the viability of this culture of competitiveness is limited to these few domains comes as a surprise to some of them.  Phoebe Rounds  Rochester, Jan. 8, 2007  ",

                    "text": "  Though the programs that Leon Botstein devises for the AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA often have a professorial tinge, they can be genuinely intriguing. Sunday afternoon, for example, he conducts ''Pioneering Influence: C\u00e9sar Franck.'' The Frenchman Franck, often thought of as a 19th-century also-ran, is presented here as a powerful influence upon French composers who followed him, including Ernest Chausson, Paul Dukas (of ''Sorcerer's Apprentice'' fame) and the little-known Alb\u00e9ric Magnard. The program concludes with Franck's stormy Symphony in D minor. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $27 to $55.  This week the WEILL MUSIC INSTITUTE AT CARNEGIE HALL presents a workshop with the eminent German organist and conductor HELMUTH RILLING. A chorus of volunteers, auditioned and prepared by Kathy Saltzman Romey, will be rehearsed and conducted by Mr. Rilling in a performance of Bach's ''St. Matthew'' Passion on Saturday night, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's and a roster of vocal soloists. Saturday at 7 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $25 to $82.  ERNST KRENEK'S ''REISEBUCH AUS DEN \u00d6STERREICHISCHEN ALPEN'' (''Diary From the Austrian Alps''), a major song cycle inspired by Schubert's ''Winterreise,'' is seldom performed, let alone complete. Krenek (1900-91), the Austrian modernist composer, has yet to get his due. So this concert on Tuesday in the intimate hall of the Austrian Cultural Forum is timely. The tenor Volker Vogel performs, accompanied by the pianist Ann Beckman. 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300; free, but reservations required.  The kinetic conductor ZUBIN MEHTA, once the music director of the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, is back leading the orchestra in a work that will test his profundity, Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. The program includes Elgar's Cello Concerto with the brilliant young Alisa Weilerstein as soloist. Thursday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $28 to $96.  Finally, for a jolt of the new, head downtown to the Kitchen for two performances by the adventurous contemporary music ensemble EIGHTH BLACKBIRD. Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; $10.  ",

                    "text": "  Adam Gillitt does not hate what is on his TV as much as he dislikes what is attached to it.  Mr. Gillitt, a graphic designer from Alameda, Calif., is exasperated by his high-definition cable box, made by the technology giant Motorola and leased to him by his local cable provider, Comcast. The $10-a-month device, he says, has a poorly designed electronic program guide and responds slowly, or not at all, to commands from the remote control.  ''Paying for something this awful hurts,'' Mr. Gillitt said.  For many Americans, the cable box -- still commonly called the set-top box, though it is now too big to balance on top of increasingly thin TVs -- may be the most disappointing piece of technology in their homes. As inventions like TiVo and YouTube alter the way people watch and control video, the traditional box has largely failed to keep up.  Now that is beginning to change.  At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, makers of set-top boxes exhibited devices with a host of new features: more hard-disk space for storing digitally recorded TV shows, easier-to-navigate program guides, connections to Web sites, DVD burners and video games.  The box manufacturers and the cable operators like Comcast, Cox and Time Warner Cable that they sell to, have an age-old motivation for improving their products: fear. New competitors are flooding into the TV business, including the industry's rivals in the telephone business, and the computer kingpins Microsoft and Apple.  Consumers can buy those alternatives at regular retail outlets, including the newest high-definition version of TiVo. It sells for $800 (with a $20 monthly fee) and can replace the box that cable and satellite providers lease to customers, instead of merely sitting on top of it and adding to living room clutter.  Cable operators are being forced to play nice with these new entrants. The Federal Communications Commission has set a deadline of July 1 for all cable operators to make their services work with boxes from all third-party manufacturers, and last week it rejected a request from Comcast to extend the deadline.  ''Set-top boxes are becoming the central piece of equipment in the home for accessing entertainment and information,'' said Joshua Goldman, chief executive of Akimbo, a Silicon Valley start-up trying to bring programming to the TV over the Internet. ''Consumers will buy their own device if they feel like they are not getting the services they want from their television operators.''  For decades, the cable industry did not worry much about introducing new features into their typically black set-top boxes. They faced little competition in their local markets and bought their equipment from one of two companies: General Instruments, which was purchased by Motorola in 2000, and Scientific Atlanta, acquired by Cisco Systems in 2005.  Both companies build TV boxes according to the specifications of cable companies, who lease them to customers and then make their money on monthly subscriptions. Because they are essentially giving the boxes away, the industry's focus, not surprisingly, is on keeping the cost of the equipment low.  But now new players are offering more sophisticated alternatives to cable boxes. Over the last two years, 30 million personal computers have been sold with Media Center software from Microsoft, which enhances video viewing on the PC, making it more like a television. The computers come with a remote control and can pause and fast-forward through video.  Many of those PCs can now replace set-top boxes, thanks to a federal law passed over a decade ago that requires cable operators to sell credit-card-size devices called CableCards. These cards can plug into a Media Center PC, or other consumer electronics appliances like DVD players, allowing them to receive regular cable channels.  Last week, Apple also joined the fray with Apple TV, a slick silver box that connects to the television and displays programs and movies that have been downloaded from iTunes. It goes on sale next month for $299.  The message to cable companies and their equipment vendors is clear: if they want to keep up, they must build a better cable box.  They appear to be listening. At the Las Vegas show, just as many visitors swarmed around Motorola's new set-top boxes as its latest mobile phones. The company showed a line of new boxes compatible with high-definition TV, with one-third more hard-disk space than its previous models, like the clumsy device Mr. Gillitt has under his TV.  The new boxes are designed to offer greater control over the television. For example, one new feature Motorola is promoting is called ''program restart.'' If cable customers miss a show by a few minutes and do not record it, they can click a button and get the cable company to retransmit it directly to them, instantly. Time Warner Cable is currently testing the service in San Antonio.  Padmasree Warrior, the chief technology officer of Motorola, said consumers now demand more from their televisions, largely thanks to TiVo, which has forced the cable companies to ask suppliers for more innovative set-top boxes. ''Enough people are experienced with time-shifting that there's a demand that the industry dynamics change,'' Ms. Warrior said.  Across the showroom floor, Scientific Atlanta executives agreed that the old featureless TV tuner was quickly becoming a relic. Among its new boxes, the company showed off one called the MCP-100: a silver set-top box with a digital video recorder and one surprising new feature: a slot for DVDs. In addition to getting live TV, the device can play movies and burn programs and movies onto discs. It is now being tested by cable companies.  Scientific Atlanta is also building Internet connections into all its boxes, so consumers can get programming from the Web in addition to the traditional ways, by cable or satellite.  ''There's a growing need for high-quality video that goes right to where it's supposed to, the television, and not to the PC, where only college kids are looking at it,'' said Robert C. McIntryre, Scientific Atlanta's chief technology officer.  The cable companies and their equipment vendors must adapt to the Internet age quickly, because soon customers will have more choices than ever. Telephone companies like AT&T and Verizon are investing heavily to bury fiber optic cables in most major cities and roll out their own TV offerings.  Because the telephone companies deliver television using Internet standards and typically package it with telephone and Internet service, they say they can offer consumers more choices and control over the viewing experience. AT&T, for example, showed off a set-top box at the Las Vegas show that received four different streams of programming (compared with most new digital cable boxes, which receive only two). That allows a customer to watch a program live while simultaneously recording three others.  One new feature that AT&T was showing, called picture-in-picture browsing, or PIP, lets a TV viewer channel surf on a small screen while continuing to watch another program on the rest of the screen.  AT&T hopes to have its TV service, called uVerse, accessible to 19 million homes by the end of next year. If it can pull it off, it would position AT&T as a serious rival to cable and satellite television providers.  All of these established companies also have to watch out for smaller rivals with their own set-top box innovations. TiVo's Series3 HD Digital Media Recorder, which went on sale last fall at electronics stores like Best Buy, is CableCard-ready, which means buyers can plug in a card from their local cable operator and use it as a substitute for a cable box.  Another technology start-up at the show, Digeo, exhibited its new Moxi service, a set-top box with digital video recorder that it plans to start selling in the latter half of this year. The Moxi also works with a CableCard and comes with smaller optional ''Moxi mates,'' which buyers can connect to the other TVs in their homes. Those televisions will then have access to the programming received by and recorded on the primary set-top box.  Digeo's chief executive, Mike Fidler, said increased competition was ushering in a renaissance in set-top-box design. ''Companies can now come in with innovative products that change the consumer experience and bring a whole new level of enjoyment to television,'' Mr. Fidler said.  ",

                    "text": "  For more than two years after Saddam Hussein's fall, the war in Iraq was about chasing down insurgents and Al Qaeda in Iraq. Last year it expanded to tamping down sectarian warfare.  Over the past three weeks, in two sets of raids and newly disclosed orders issued by President Bush, a third front has opened -- against Iran.  Administration officials say the goal is limited to preventing Iranians from aiding in attacks on American and Iraqi forces inside Iraq. But in recent interviews and public statements, senior members of the Bush administration have made it clear that their agenda goes significantly further, toward foiling Iran's dream of emerging as the greatest power in the Middle East.  In an interview on Friday, before she left on her latest Middle East trip, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described what she called an ''evolving'' strategy to confront ''destabilizing behavior'' by Iran across the region. Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said Sunday on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' that the United States was resisting an Iranian effort ''to basically establish hegemony'' throughout the region.  Even some of Mr. Bush's fiercest critics do not question that the administration's conviction that Iran's ambitions are large is correct. A few midlevel administration officials wondered even in 2003 whether Iran was a far more potent threat than Mr. Hussein.  Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, administration officials argued that deposing Mr. Hussein would send a powerful signal to Iran and North Korea, the two countries that Mr. Bush identified along with Iraq in his 2002 State of the Union address as part of an ''axis of evil.''  ''You heard this argument in meetings all the time,'' a senior official on the National Security Council, who has since left the administration, recalled recently. ''Iraq would make the harder problems of Iran and North Korea easier.''  But the opposite happened. North Korea tested a nuclear device in October. And Iran has sped ahead with a uranium enrichment program.  Now, despite the urging of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to engage with Iran, Washington is moving in a more confrontational direction. It is stationing more naval, air and antimissile batteries off Iran's coast; has persuaded many international businesses to cut off dealings with Iran; and it has interfered with Iranians inside Iraqi territory.  ''The administration does have Iran on the brain, and I think they are exaggerating the amount of Iranian activities in Iraq,'' Kenneth M. Pollack, the director of research at the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution, said Sunday. ''There's a good chance that this is going to be counterproductive -- that this is a way to get into a spiral with Iran that leads you into conflict. The likely response from the Iranians is that they are going to want to demonstrate to us that they are not going to be pushed around.''  Administration officials say ignoring Iran's activities will only lead to escalation with the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ''There's no question that everything that has gone wrong in Iraq has made life easier for the Iranians,'' one senior White House official said recently. ''The question is what you do about that.''  The answer, shaped in the National Security Council, is for the American military to make targets of Iranians whom they believe are fueling attacks, a decision that Mr. Bush made months ago that was disclosed only last week.  At least twice in the last month, in raids in Iraq that have infuriated officials there, American soldiers have detained Iranians. On Sunday, Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, called for the release of five Iranians taken in the most recent raid, which occurred early on Thursday in Erbil. On CNN's ''Late Edition,'' he said that while the five were members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the group ''in fact is part of the Iranian political system.''  The potential strategic split with the Iraqi government over how to handle the Iranians is only one of the questions raised by Washington's new approach. First among them is whether the effort will stop at Iran's borders. In Congressional testimony, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates has said that he sees no need to enter Iranian territory.  Yet American officials have been careful not to rule out the possibility of American actions inside Iran. Pressed on the ABC News program ''This Week'' on Sunday about excluding the option of going after Iranians inside Iran, Mr. Hadley said that for now, Iraq was ''the best place'' for the United States to take on the Iranians.  ''So, you don't believe you have the authority to go into Iran?'' the host, George Stephanopoulos, asked.  ''I didn't say that,'' Mr. Hadley responded. ''This is another issue. Any time you have questions about crossing international borders, there are legal issues.''  A second question is whether Mr. Bush will step up covert as well as overt efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program. So far, the evidence collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency suggests that Iran's nuclear efforts have run into technical obstacles, but concerns remain that inspectors are missing secret facilities. A third question is what Washington would do if the Iranians looked for ways to strike back.  Escalating tensions are the fear of American allies in the region, who worry about Iran, but worry more about provoking it.  On Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney argued that America's actions were intended to protect allies in the Persian Gulf -- though it is far from clear that Iran's Sunni Arab neighbors have signed on to the strategy. ''If you go and talk with the gulf states or if you talk with the Saudis or if you talk about the Israelis or the Jordanians, the entire region is worried,'' Mr. Cheney said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' He described how the Iranians ''sit astride the Straits of Hormuz'' and its oil-shipping channels, and how they support Hamas and Hezbollah.  ''So the threat that Iran represents is growing,'' he said, in words reminiscent of how he once built a case against Mr. Hussein. ''It's multidimensional, and it is, in fact, of concern to everybody in the region.''  THE REACH OF WAR: NEWS ANALYSIS  ",

                    "text": "  Introduced on Sunday: Acura Advanced Sports Car design study  Is it real? The mechanical bits are all present, and the body is metal, not Styrofoam. But Acura's Advanced Sports Car Concept is strictly a nonrunning prototype, with its doors and hood sealed for the run of the auto show.  What's the point? The NSX was Acura's two-seat halo car, an Asian Ferrari that served as a showcase of technology and innovation. Since its demise, Acura's parent, Honda, has been hard at work on a replacement to keep the performance fires burning.  What they said: ''I must tell you that my own passion is performance,'' Takeo Fukui, president and chief executive of Honda Motor Company, said.  What they didn't say: That this is the next NSX, or that Acura is overdue for something more potent than the brand's current crop of V-6 engines. The next episode in the hunt for NSX V2.0 occurs at the Tokyo auto show, in October 2007.  What makes it tick? The A.S.C.C. has a front-mounted V-10 coupled to sport-tuned version of Acura's all-wheel drive hardware.  How much, how soon? No one would let us peek under the hood, much less mention anything as vulgar as a price or when to expect this car to be production ready.  How's it look? The Advanced Sports Car Concept looks familiar -- we see a lot of Audi R8, minus the gaping grill, and the Lexus LF-A concept of 2005, in this Acura's front end. It could probably do with an extra dose of edginess when the second iteration appears in Tokyo.  ",

Researchers randomly selected 5,008 people older than 50 and followed them for five years. At the start of the study, they interviewed the subjects about medications and general health. The subjects filled out yearly questionnaires reporting fractures caused by falling from a bed, chair or standing height. (A co-author of the study has received grants and honorariums from several drug companies.)  One hundred and thirty-seven people, or 2.7 percent of the subjects, were daily users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, a rate similar to that of the general populations of the United States and Canada. After controlling for the use of other psychotropic medicines, age, sex, education, height, weight, smoking status and other variables, daily users of S.S.R.I.'s were 2.1 times as likely to suffer fractures as those who did not use the medicine. The study  appears in the Jan. 22 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.  ''We're not recommending that people stop their S.S.R.I.'s,'' said Dr. David Goltzman, a professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal and the senior author of the study. ''But people should realize that this is a risk and that they might want to undertake lifestyle changes like participating in exercise and making sure their diet is appropriate in calcium and vitamin D.''  Using S.S.R.I.'s was also associated with an increased risk of falls and with decreased mineral bone density. But after controlling for falls and low bone density, the risk of fracture persisted. The scientists speculated that other pathways leading to impaired bone quality might be at work.  VITAL SIGNS: HAZARDS  ",

                    "text": "  At the Final Four in Boston last April, the North Carolina women's basketball team saw a night full of promise dissolve into a disquieting mess.  The top-seeded Tar Heels lost in a semifinal to Maryland, which went on to win the national championship against Duke. North Carolina guard Ivory Latta said the flight home was filled with quiet tears.  Weeks and months passed, and Latta refused to watch the film from that game.  But on Friday, as the undefeated Tar Heels prepared for Sunday's game against Maryland, North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell figured the time was right. Her players sat and stomached last season's end.  ''Man, it was depressing,'' Latta said. ''It was very hard to watch.''  But Latta said the film was also helpful. The players noticed simple mistakes they had made and vowed not to repeat them. At the Comcast Center on Sunday, the second-ranked Tar Heels took their long-awaited shot at the No. 3 Terrapins. This time, they walked off the court delighted, with an 84-71 victory that snapped Maryland's 19-game home winning streak before a crowd of 17,950 that was the largest to attend an Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season women's game.  ''Playing against North Carolina, playing against Duke, the revenge factor is so, so big right now,'' said Maryland forward Laura Harper, whose team lost to Duke, 81-62, on Jan. 13. ''They come ready to play us.''  For a time, North Carolina's victory looked as if it would come easily. The Tar Heels (23-0, 7-0) raced to a 20-point second-half lead behind the shooting of Latta, who made six 3-pointers and finished with 32 points.  But Maryland (21-2, 5-2) responded with a furious comeback that was led by the senior guard Shay Doron, who scored 13 of her 19 points in the second half. With 3 minutes 13 seconds left, Doron converted a 15-footer, pulling the Terrapins to 67-66.  ''She just kept putting them up, making shots and all,'' Hatchell said. ''But, you know, that's Maryland; I knew they could score like that.''  The Tar Heels, who entered the game as the nation's top-scoring team, can pounce quickly, too. They closed the game with a 17-5 run, and revenge was theirs.  When Maryland, Duke and North Carolina reached the Final Four last season, it was the first time a conference had placed three teams in the national semifinals; the A.C.C. had never sent more than one.  This season, the three A.C.C. powers have a combined record of 65-2, with the two losses coming within their impressive triumvirate. Maryland plays host to Duke on Feb. 18 but will not face North Carolina again in the regular season. North Carolina plays host to Duke on Feb. 8 before visiting the Blue Devils on Feb. 25.  Sunday's game became a sellout more than two weeks ago. The atmosphere and the national-television audience might have caused some early-game jitters for the Terrapins. Maryland missed 15 of its first 18 field-goal attempts and committed 10 turnovers in the first 10 minutes.  ''Anxiousness, nerves, whatever you want to call it,'' Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. ''But at the same time, we have played on the biggest stage before.''  With 30 seconds remaining in the first half and North Carolina leading, 33-27, Maryland guard Kristi Toliver was hounded by two defenders as she struggled to bring the ball across midcourt. Frese stomped the floor and yelled to a referee, frustrated that a foul had not been called. She received a technical foul, and Latta made both free throws, giving the Tar Heels an 8-point halftime lead. Latta made four 3-pointers in the first 4:50 of the second half, putting North Carolina ahead by 20.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL  ",

On Monday, he was an honored guest at Mr. Spitzer's inauguration, and on Wednesday, he received a standing ovation during Mr. Spitzer's State of the State message. In an interview afterward, he seemed delighted to see a fellow Democrat control the governor's office after 12 years of Republican rule.  ''Rip van Winkle just got a bad case of insomnia,'' Mr. Carey quipped. He was referring to Mr. Spitzer's inaugural address, which compared the state during the Pataki years to Rip van Winkle, the Washington Irving character who was asleep for 20 years. Mr. Carey, New York's governor from 1975 through 1982, said of Mr. Spitzer's address: ''It's a very big agenda, but it's not too big for New York. A lot of good reform measures.''

This is particularly onerous for many retirees who frequently pay some 20 percent of their pension and Social Security income for property taxes, yet on the block where they live, a wealthier person with the same property assessment may pay only 5 percent of his income for property taxes.  Property taxes are regressive in that payments reflect property values rather than income, thus favoring the wealthy over the middle class and poor.  Reform will not occur through plans to reduce benefits for state employees because the prospect of labor unrest and political retribution in an election year will surely deter legislators from provoking a significant part of the electorate.  The fair and appropriate way to achieve property tax reform is to require those with the highest incomes to pay a higher state income tax and use that money to substantially finance education while reducing property taxes.

                    "text": "  Although it has been a decade since the Museum of Modern Art's giant Jasper Johns retrospective, there have been a spate of smaller shows devoted to aspects of his work. Now the National Gallery of Art in Washington has put its own spin on his oeuvre with ''JASPER JOHNS: AN ALLEGORY OF PAINTING, 1955-1965,'' which opens today.  Not wanting it to seem like either another retrospective or a survey show, Jeffrey Weiss, the gallery's curator of modern and contemporary art, has traced this artist's work through four motifs: the target, the mechanical device, the stenciled naming of colors and the imprint of the body.  Included in the show will be 84 works from public and private collections, including the largest group of target paintings ever assembled. Among them is ''Target With Plaster Casts'' (1955), which is the image on the cover of the show's catalog. It has been lent by David Geffen, the entertainment mogul. Also on view will be many of Mr. Johns's most famous works, like ''False Start'' (1959), which now belongs to the Chicago collector Kenneth C. Griffin, and ''Jubilee'' (1960). Through April 29; nga.gov.  An exhibition devoted to another popular American artist, ROBERT GOBER, opens Saturday at two of the Matthew Marks Galleries in Chelsea. Like Mr. Johns, Mr. Gober is known for using familiar vernacular American forms in his work.  Consisting of only new works -- two sculptures and several drawings -- the exhibition will feature a sculpture of a plastic milk crate filled with sculptures of Granny Smith apples that rests on a cast of a wooden footstool in the space at 526 West 22nd Street. A block away, at 521 West 21st Street, will be a second cast of a wooden footstool, this one made with an old packing blanket folded on the seat. Through March 10; (212) 243-0200.  ",

                    "text": "  Moderate alcohol consumption appears to pose little danger to men with high blood pressure, and may even reduce their risk of heart attack, according to a study published Jan. 2.  Beginning in 1986, researchers followed 11,711 male health professionals previously given diagnoses of hypertension, using a questionnaire about diet, alcohol consumption and medical history every four years. The study, which followed the men through 2002, appears in The Annals of Internal Medicine.  During 16 years of follow-up, the study recorded 653 heart attacks, of which 279 were fatal. There was little difference between abstainers and those who consumed up to 4.9 grams of alcohol per day. But after adjusting for age, smoking, the use of blood pressure medication and other factors, men who consumed 15 to 29.9 grams a day -- the equivalent of one to two drinks -- lowered their risk for fatal heart attack by 30 percent. The more alcohol they consumed, the more they reduced their risk, by up to 60 percent for those who consumed more than 50 grams a day.  ''In no way does this suggest that people should be drinking more than three drinks a day,'' said Eric B. Rimm, a co-author of the study and an associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''But the results do suggest that people who have hypertension have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease if they drink moderately.''  Alcohol consumption also lowered the risk for nonfatal heart attack, but it did not affect the risk of death from cardiovascular disease or death from all causes.  The authors acknowledge that their data depends on self-reports, which are not always reliable. Dr. Rimm received an honorarium two years ago from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.

                    "text": "  TWO weeks ago, President Bush called for a long-term plan to increase the size of the armed forces. As our leaders consider various options for carrying out Mr. Bush's vision, one issue likely to generate fierce debate is ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the policy that bars openly gay service members from the military. Indeed, leaders in the new Congress are planning to re-introduce a bill to repeal the policy next year.  As was the case in 1993 -- the last time the American people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly gay men and lesbians should serve in the military -- the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides. The debate must be conducted with sensitivity, but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14 years.  When I was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I supported the current policy because I believed that implementing a change in the rules at that time would have been too burdensome for our troops and commanders. I still believe that to have been true. The concern among many in the military was that given the longstanding view that homosexuality was incompatible with service, letting people who were openly gay serve would lower morale, harm recruitment and undermine unit cohesion.  In the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve. President Bill Clinton, who promised to lift the ban during his campaign, was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition, which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take. The compromise that came to be known as ''don't ask, don't tell'' was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve.  The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much evidence suggests that it has.  Last year I held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines, including some with combat experience in Iraq, and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew. These conversations showed me just how much the military has changed, and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers.  This perception is supported by a new Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people. And 24 foreign nations, including Israel, Britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism, let gays serve openly, with none reporting morale or recruitment problems.  I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces. Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.  But if America is ready for a military policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, the timing of the change should be carefully considered. As the 110th Congress opens for business, some of its most urgent priorities, like developing a more effective strategy in Iraq, share widespread support that spans political affiliations. Addressing such issues could help heal the divisions that cleave our country. Fighting early in this Congress to lift the ban on openly gay service members is not likely to add to that healing, and it risks alienating people whose support is needed to get this country on the right track.  By taking a measured, prudent approach to change, political and military leaders can focus on solving the nation's most pressing problems while remaining genuinely open to the eventual and inevitable lifting of the ban. When that day comes, gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are, and the military will no longer need to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose.  Op-Ed Contributor John M. Shalikashvili, a retired army general, was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997.  ",

They know that it is possible for kids in our lowest-income communities to excel academically, and that if we are going to accomplish this there is no way around the hard work of doing what we know is essential in ensuring excellence in any institution -- empowered leadership, great people at every level, accountability and sufficient resources and support systems.  It is inspiring that after five years of extraordinary effort and tremendous progress, this administration is still saying, ''We're not satisfied,'' and is acting tirelessly on all that has been learned to this point, always with one and only one very clear goal -- educational opportunity for our kids.

A warning by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- that looming Social Security and Medicare deficits would burden the economy for years to come if they were not addressed -- pulled down the markets on Thursday. His comments came at a Senate hearing.  On top of that, Wall Street was disappointed by technology earnings reports, including those of bellwethers like Apple, Intel and I.B.M. Apple's shares fell 7.7 percent for the week, among the worst performances in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Among the Dow industrials, I.B.M.'s drop of 2.5 percent and Intel's decline of 5 percent were among the worst for the week.  For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.45 points, or 0.08 percent, to close at 12,565.53. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.23 point, or 0.02 percent, to close at 1,430.50. The Nasdaq composite index fell 51.51 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 2,451.31. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.78 percent from 4.77 percent the previous week.  JEFF SOMMER  ",

                    "text": "  The Miami Heat defeated the Knicks handily Monday without Shaquille O'Neal and Dwyane Wade. On Friday, the teams will meet again, but this time it may be the Knicks who are short-handed.  Guard Stephon Marbury, who missed Wednesday's game against the Phoenix Suns with a knee injury, said Thursday that he was fit to play. But Coach Isiah Thomas said that center Eddy Curry, the Knicks' leading scorer, was questionable. Curry, who strained his left calf muscle during the second half Wednesday, did not practice Thursday.  One Knicks player whose status was not ambiguous was Jared Jeffries, an ineffective starter who played 9 minutes 14 seconds in the past two games. Jeffries, a forward, received a vote of confidence from Thomas, who did not discuss potential lineups other than to say that Jeffries would start against the Heat.  ''He's definitely got to play a little better than what he's playing,'' Thomas said. ''We'll stick with him, and hopefully he'll come out of it. And if not, we have some guys on the bench that are eager to play.''  The Knicks (18-26) will have their hands full even if Curry and Marbury are healthy and Jeffries produces. The Heat defeated them Monday in Miami, 101-83, without O'Neal and Wade, its two best players. If the Knicks lose, they will fall to a season-worst nine games below .500.  O'Neal and Wade returned Wednesday as the Heat (19-23) lost to the Indiana Pacers in overtime, 96-94. Wade was coming off a sprained ankle, and O'Neal had missed the previous 35 games while recovering from knee surgery. O'Neal, who came off the bench and played 14 minutes against the Pacers, will presumably play more against the Knicks.  Asked how effective he thought O'Neal would be Friday, Thomas pointed to the doorway leading to the trainer's room. ''When he stands in that door, he takes up the whole door,'' Thomas said. ''And when he stands in front of somebody, you can't see them. He's a big man, and that's the Shaq effect. It has nothing to do with points and rebounds.''  Defense might not be Curry's specialty, but he seems to be the natural matchup against O'Neal. If Curry is unable to play, it is not clear how Thomas will respond.  ''It would be a huge loss, but we'll get by,'' Thomas said.  Channing Frye would probably join Jeffries at forward. Thomas could go with a big frontcourt by inserting the seldom-used Jerome James or Kelvin Cato at center. Or he could use a smaller frontcourt and have the 6-foot-9 David Lee defend O'Neal. Lee would surrender four inches to O'Neal, but he is bulkier than Frye or Jeffries. The 6-7 Malik Rose, who sometimes guarded O'Neal when he played for the San Antonio Spurs, is another option.  The Knicks may simply rotate several players on O'Neal, spreading their fouls. They may try to wear him down on offense, too.  ''He's coming off an injury, so hopefully we can get out and push the ball in transition and make him run up and down the court,'' Jeffries said.  Jeffries missed 26 of the Knicks' first 30 games because of injury or suspension. He came to the Knicks in the off-season with a reputation as a defensive stopper. But his play this season has been as unsightly as his jump shot.  After practice Thursday, Jeffries said he needed to play with more confidence, an observation he has made before.  ''Whenever I play well, coaches play me,'' Jeffries said.  He added, referring to Thomas: ''So I haven't played well, and really right now he has no reason to play me. I put myself in this position.''  A return to form by Jeffries will be needed, especially if Curry is unavailable. Curry, who has started all 44 games and has been the focal point of the Knicks' offense, had his way inside against the Suns before feeling tightness in his calf during the third quarter. He was injured when he planted his left foot in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter. Curry, who left the game for good, was listed as questionable for Friday.  ''It's kind of hard to gauge it, being I didn't practice,'' said Curry, who initially feared the injury might cost him 15 to 20 games. ''It's kind of painful right now when I step. Try to loosen it up and see what happens.''  Marbury, who was listed as probable, seemed more certain of his status, though Thomas said he would be evaluated again Friday. If healthy, Marbury would probably join Quentin Richardson in the backcourt. Marbury has been playing with pain in his left knee since Dec. 15.  ''I worked out a little bit, did some running,'' Marbury said. ''I felt pretty good.'' He added: ''Yes, I'm playing tomorrow.''  BASKETBALL  ",

''My daughter got involved with drugs at an early age,'' Ms. Burton said. Her daughter, Dana Burton Rivera, was 16 when her mother noticed a change. She started on cocaine and wound up on crack, an addiction it pained Ms. Burton to witness. ''It was like she was kidnapped against her will,'' Ms. Burton remembered.  Brittany was born addicted to cocaine and spent seven weeks in the hospital before she was released to her grandmother. Brittany spent her early years with her grandmother, although her mother lived in the same building and was close by. ''I was 4 or 5 when I lived with my mother,'' Brittany said, ''and that week when I was 6.''  Brittany's mother, Ms. Rivera, got clean at 21. ''Squeaky clean,'' Ms. Burton said. ''When she left it, she left it for good.'' Brittany moved in with her a year or so later, and in January 1998 Ms. Rivera gave birth to twins. But while she had survived addiction, the years of drug abuse had taken their toll.  Ms. Rivera died suddenly, less than two weeks after Brittany's sixth birthday. She went into the hospital with back pain, and died from complications stemming from her years as an addict. ''August the 15th, my child was gone,'' Ms. Burton said. The twins just were 7 months old, and Ms. Burton was heartbroken. ''I loved her beyond human understanding,'' she said. ''They didn't come sweeter than her.''  Brittany now lives with her grandmother, and she carries her mother's high school graduation picture in her wallet. The likeness is striking. Brittany, pleasant and well spoken, is a freshman at St. Michael Academy, an all-girl Roman Catholic high school in Manhattan. Her first report card shows an 85 percent average and positive comments from teachers. On Wednesdays after school, she stays for Global Community, in which students discuss world events.  Catholic school is important to Ms. Burton. She hopes it will help keep her granddaughter safe. ''The environment is better,'' she said. ''Environment to me is very important. I don't see how you can separate a child from environment.''  She feels that the school will provide the discipline that Brittany needs to succeed. Brittany interjected, ''It's important to me -- I like the school.''  But paying for it is a challenge. High school costs $550 a month, and Ms. Burton has not managed to keep up. ''I can pay January,'' she said, but she has fallen about $1,000 behind since school began in September. Making ends meet on her retiree income is a continual challenge. Ms. Burton receives $1,200 a month from the New York Telephone Company, where she worked as an operator until 1991. She also receives $600 from Social Security. Brittany receives $154 a month in Social Security survivor benefits from her mother's death. Their rent is $919 a month, and public assistance covers $300.  After Ms. Burton fell behind on her Consolidated Edison bill in August, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, stepped in to help. It arranged a $200 energy grant from Con Edison, and used $95 of Neediest Cases money to prevent a turn-off. Ms. Burton has again fallen behind, and this month an additional $130 in Neediest Cases money was used to keep the power from being turned off. ''I'm grateful; it's going to help me a lot,'' Ms. Burton said.  This month, Ms. Burton goes to family court to seek custody of the twins, William Brandon Sykes and Breanna Geneva Sykes, who turned 9 on Saturday. Ms. Burton saw them regularly until last year, when their father went into drug rehabilitation. They have been living with their father's partner. ''I want them back in my life pretty regularly,'' Ms. Burton said.  Brittany is looking forward to being older and being able to go to the movies alone, and to talk to boys on the phone. ''Don't rush it, Brittany, it's coming,'' Ms. Burton said.  She is trying to teach her granddaughter as much as she can, now. ''I'm in the evening of my life; she's in the morning,'' she said. ''I'm not going to be with her always. I try to teach her the best I can.''  Ms. Burton is hoping that Brittany will make her way safely through their neighborhood and out into the world beyond. ''It's O.K. for me, you know, 'cause I'm pretty strong,'' she said. ''I want her to get a good education so she can move on.'' But it might take some outside help to keep her granddaughter in the school Ms. Burton thinks best.

One of two modified with superchargers, it is the only remaining original.  1937 DUESENBERG MODEL SJ CABRIOLET ($2.8 million at RM Auctions) The last Duesenberg built, described by the auction company as the last unrestored Duesenberg. Designed by the artist Rudolf Bauer with bright colors and exaggerated shapes, it was stored for 45 years after Bauer's death in 1953. The car is original down to the whitewall tires, chrome, paint, interior and World War II gas-rationing stamp.  1965 SHELBY DAYTONA SUPER COUPE ($1.32 million at Russo & Steele) The only Cobra coupe built with the 427 V-8, this car was never completed by Shelby American. Sold in pieces when the company was liquidated, it was eventually built in Colorado and is now operational. Russo & Steele previously sold this car for $1.46 million in August 2005.  1957 CHEVY NOMAD CUSTOM  ($113,400 at Silver) Fitted with a Corvette suspension, 350 V-8 and 4-speed automatic, this much-modified wagon combined a classic look with modern performance.

It was followed by repeats of ''Two and a Half Men'' at 8:30 (8.5 million), ''Criminals Minds'' at 9 (11.9 Million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10 (10.4 million). NBC was not far behind, getting a boost from ''Deal or No Deal'' at 9 (11.3 million) and ''Medium'' at 10 (9.3 million). Faring less well for NBC, ''Friday Night Lights'' earned 6.3 million viewers at 8. ABC was last over all, despite the season premiere of ''According to Jim'' at 8 (7.4 million).

                    "text": "  For years, golf was scarce in the Caribbean, where strict development rules and lack of fresh water posed major challenges. But thanks in part to a new breed of salt-tolerant turf grass, known as paspalum, golf courses have been springing up on many islands in recent years. Anguilla got its first golf course in November. Barbados, which has a total of seven courses, played host to the World Golf Championships for the first time last month. And the Dominican Republic, with a new Jack Nicklaus-designed course, Punta Espada, and half a dozen other courses planned, is quickly gaining notice among golfers as a hotspot to tee-off.  But for many avid golfers, the island of choice remains Jamaica. While it may be better known for reggae, Jamaica also has 12 golf courses, with a range in difficulty to suit every level of player. Most courses are in and around resort centers, making it easy to play a round at one course in the morning and hit a different set of links in the afternoon. Montego Bay, a resort city on the north coast of the island, has three notable courses -- Half Moon Golf Club, a Robert Trent Jones Sr.-designed course; White Witch, owned by Ritz-Carlton; and Cinnamon Hill, at the Rose Hall Resort & Country Club -- all within a 10-minute drive of one another.  Green fees in Jamaica range from $23 for the nine-hole Manchester Golf Club in Mandeville, the oldest golf course in the Caribbean, to $200 at the White Witch.

                    "text": "  The two men first saw the baby from across the Bronx street, dangling from a fire escape four stories above the sidewalk. His grip was growing weaker by the second. The two men saw only one choice: run over and try to catch him.  They positioned themselves below, arms out. The little boy fell. He glanced off a branch of a tree that was brushing against the fire escape. Then he bounced off the chest of one of the men, who was knocked off balance and could not grab him.  But he landed safely in the arms of the other man, who managed to hold on tight.  And so yesterday, the two men -- longtime friends who had been looking over a used Honda that one was thinking of selling and the other was thinking of buying -- became the second and third good Samaritans of the new year, not even a week old. The rescue came two days after another New Yorker flung himself onto the subway tracks to save a 20-year-old film student who had fallen from the platform.  ''This is a week of heroes here in New York,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said later yesterday.  The two men -- Julio Gonzalez, 43, a mechanic who lives in the neighborhood, and Pedro Nevarez, 40, of Corona, Queens -- insisted that they had just done the obvious thing. As Mr. Nevarez, who has a 19-year-old foster son, put it: ''I'm not a hero. I did what any other father would do. When you're a father, you would do this whether it's your child or not.''  By then, a crowd of reporters and residents of the East Tremont neighborhood was swirling around them, and someone said, ''If you're not a hero, how about an angel without wings?''  Mr. Nevarez simply smiled. Mr. Gonzalez said, ''I feel I did something good.''  The baby, identified by the police as Timothy Addo, 3, was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was treated for minor scrapes and was released, a hospital spokesman said.  Before long, a man who said he was Timothy's great-uncle returned from the hospital to the apartment building at 2105 Daly Avenue, near East 180th Street, and showed the crowd a photograph of Timothy after his tumble, taken with a cellphone. The boy had what appeared to be a bandage on his head, but looked as if he was enjoying the attention. The police said that Timothy had been in his baby sitter's apartment on the top floor of the five-story building, and that there were no window guards. He crawled onto a radiator and from there, onto the fire escape, they said.  Last night at the 48th Precinct station house, the police were questioning the baby sitter, identified by law enforcement officials as Carol Baldwin, 50. It was not clear if any charges would be filed against her.  Ricky Serra, 31, said his daughter Alesha, 1 1/2, was also in Ms. Baldwin's apartment when Timothy climbed out the window. Ms. Baldwin also watches Mr. Serra's 4-year-old daughter, Adriana, after school. He said he would not send the girls back to her.  ''That could have been my baby,'' he said, referring to Timothy. But he added that Ms. Baldwin could not have foreseen that Timothy would play with the window.  Timothy's mother, Katrina Cosme, 26, was at work when the boy clambered out the window. Going step by step on the fire escape, he managed to work his way down one floor as passers-by below took notice.  Some screamed for help. Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez sprang into action, dashing toward the fire escape even though Mr. Gonzalez was not sure that the little object on the fire escape was a child. ''I thought it was a toy or something,'' he said later.  At first, he told Mr. Nevarez to run inside the building and pull the child back in. But the door was locked. Mr. Gonzalez realized that there was no time, and called his friend back. Mr. Nevarez said he tried to grab the bottom rung of the fire escape, hoping to climb up and carry the baby into the building. But the fire escape was too far off the ground.  They took their places under the fire escape just as Timothy lost his grip. Mr. Nevarez said Mr. Gonzalez told him: ''Stay right next to me. We're not going to let him hit the floor.''  First, the boy bounced off Mr. Nevarez. He said Timothy knocked the wind out of him, and also knocked him down.  Mr. Gonzalez then realized that it was up to him. ''I just hoped and prayed that I would be able to catch him,'' he said.  He did. ''He came down hard,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''He only weighed 45 pounds, but it felt like he weighed more than a hundred.'' They wrapped him in Mr. Nevarez's jacket and waited for help to arrive.  A neighbor, Migdalia Melendez, 43, said that Ms. Baldwin, the baby sitter, was standing behind the ambulance as the paramedics closed the doors, and that Timothy reached for her. Ms. Melendez said Ms. Baldwin put her arms around Timothy and said, ''I was only in the bathroom for a second.''  Ms. Melendez said she had been in her living room on the second floor when she heard people screaming and saw Timothy on the fire escape. She ran outside, as did her husband, Luis.  ''Don't blame the baby sitter,'' he said. ''She's a good woman.''  Another neighbor, Kyiesha Johnson, 19, said that she had known Ms. Baldwin from childhood and that Ms. Baldwin had looked after children in the building for years. If parents had to go to the store, Ms. Johnson said, the baby sitter kept tabs on their children.  ''She always tended to the kids perfect,'' Ms. Johnson said.  Timothy's mother, Ms. Cosme, arrived at the building a couple of hours after the excitement. She hugged Mr. Gonzalez and cut through the crowd. Last night, she told television reporters that she was grateful.  After the police arrived, Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez gave each other a high-five. That was when Mr. Nevarez realized that his hand was sore from landing on it when he was knocked down. His chest also felt sore. But he decided that he did not need medical help.  He and Mr. Gonzalez have known each other since they were 9 and 6, respectively, Mr. Nevarez said. They grew up on 174th Street in the Mount Eden section of the Bronx and have kept in close touch over the years.  ''We were in the right place at the right time,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''If we hadn't been there, we'd be talking about how the kid across the street fell out of the house and died.''  ",

                    "text": "  JPMorgan Chase & Company reported a 68 percent gain in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, ending 2006 on a high note that showed record profits for its investment banking advisory businesses and vast improvement in its trading results.  JPMorgan's strong performance came during a banner year for Wall Street. But it also reflects the steady progress that James Dimon, its chairman and chief executive, has made in integrating the bank. Now that he has wrung out most of the savings from the 2004 merger with Bank One, Mr. Dimon said yesterday that he was ''declaring victory'' in the $58 billion deal.  Further progress, however, may be difficult if credit quality deteriorates sharply and the markets slow, resulting in fewer deals.  Yet Mr. Dimon was optimistic, noting the bank's strong deal pipeline and the improvement in virtually all its businesses. While the bank experienced a decline in the credit quality of its subprime mortgage business, Mr. Dimon said that he expected an uptick not a major increase in overall credit costs.  For the quarter, JPMorgan earned $4.5 billion, or $1.26 a share, compared with $2.7 billion, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The increase reflects a $622 million after-tax gain related to its exit this year from the corporate trust business when the bank swapped those assets for Bank of New York's 338 branches. Revenue rose 14 percent, to $16.9 billion. Shares of JPMorgan rose 4 cents, to $48.43.  The strong results led Mr. Dimon to suggest that the board would consider increasing the dividend later this year. He also reiterated that the bank was now ready, if not yet willing, to do a deal.  Investment bank earnings rose 51 percent, to $1 billion in the fourth quarter, based on the bank's big advisory business and more consistent trading results in a strong market. Fixed-income trading revenue increased 77 percent, to $2 billion after a particularly bad quarter in 2005. Equity trading revenue nearly doubled, to $909 million.  The asset management business also showed steady revenue and profit growth. Revenue rose 29 percent, to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, while profits rose 19 percent, to $407 million.  And the credit card division posted similarly strong results at least for now. Profit rose 138 percent, to $719 million. Revenue growth was essentially flat.  A difficult operating environment and a slowdown in the housing market continued to weigh on the retail banking division. Fourth-quarter net income was $718 million, down 11 percent from a year ago.

                    "text": "  On consecutive nights, the Nets have shown that resiliency and effort are slowly finding places in their team persona. But they are still learning how to catch a winning attitude.  After trailing by 16 points in the first half and by 8 in the third quarter against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night, the Nets battled back in the fourth, only to watch the game slip from their grasp in the closing minutes.  With a 96-91 loss to the Cavaliers, the Nets had their season-long winning streak of three games snapped, and they missed an opportunity to beat two of the Eastern Conference's best teams on consecutive nights.  On Friday night, the Nets overcame an 18-0 deficit to start the game against the Chicago Bulls and executed to perfection down the stretch to win by 5 points at Continental Arena.  After Saturday night's game here, Nets point guard Jason Kidd said: ''There were six minutes left and the momentum was in our favor, and we turned the ball over and took some bad shots. It was kind of the opposite of what we did last night.''  Still, Kidd echoed the sentiments of several of his teammates that the Nets (14-19), who have limped to one of the most disappointing starts in the National Basketball Association, finally have something to feel good about.  ''The effort was there,'' he said. ''And if we can build on what we've done the last four games in the sense of playing hard, we'll hopefully be in the win column more.''  Kidd, who had 11 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists, said he was playing with a stiff back that he had hurt against the Bulls.  The Nets held LeBron James to a quiet 19 points and forced him into 5 turnovers. But the Cavaliers' frontcourt of Drew Gooden (21 points, 6 offensive rebounds) and Zydrunas Ilgauskas (16 points), along with guard Larry Hughes (21 points), picked up much of the slack.  The Nets' frontline was again depleted because their starting power forward, Jason Collins, missed his second consecutive game with a strained lower back. The reserve forward Josh Boone was also out of the game because of a migraine.  Yet the Nets got another impressive performance from center Mikki Moore, who has been shifted into the starting lineup because of the season-ending injury to Nenad Krstic. Moore scored 18 points and grabbed 10 rebounds.  Moore and a couple of his fellow role players opened the fourth quarter on a 14-4 run that turned a 6-point deficit into a 4-point lead.  The rookie point guard Marcus Williams led like a veteran during that stretch, getting a couple of open jump shots on pick-and-roll plays. He helped cap the run by finding his fellow rookie teammate Hassan Adams with a lob pass for an emphatic dunk.  ''Those guys did a very good job to get us in that position,'' Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said. ''In the last seven minutes, unfortunately, it was a combination of lack of ability to get defensive stops and lack of ability to score down the stretch, obviously, that determined the outcome of the game.''  With the score tied at 83-83, Ilagauskas got an open dunk courtesy of a pass from James. Kidd lost the ball on his team's next possession, eventually leading to a reverse dunk by James. Two possessions later, Gooden scored on a driving two-handed dunk. Moments later, Hughes all but sealed the game for the Cavaliers with a layup.  ''The last six minutes, we pride ourselves in trying to out-execute teams, and we did it for maybe five minutes,'' said Vince Carter, who scored 18 points.  One encouraging sign for the Nets was the play of small forward Richard Jefferson, who finished with 17 points. Jefferson has struggled this season because of injuries to both ankles, and many people within the Nets' organization have cited his lack of explosiveness as a direct reason for the team's problems.  During the Nets' three-game winning streak, Jefferson shot 56.4 percent from the field and averaged 21 points, both well above his season averages.  Power forward Cliff Robinson, who was playing in only his second game Saturday night after missing a month and a half because of an injured left knee, pointed to another possibility for the Nets' early struggles: a lack of accountability.  Robinson, 40, is the longest-tenured player in the N.B.A., and one of the few Nets willing to correct his teammates when they do something wrong.  ''You're not out there to step on anyone's toes or hurt anyone's feelings,'' he said before the game. ''But at the same time, if you can't take constructive criticism, you're in the wrong business.''  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  ''Our Overrated Inner Self,'' by Orlando Patterson (column, Dec. 26), represents the clearest thinking on social and political discourse I've read in a long while.  It breaks down the reality of interpersonal relations both at a microcosmic and a macrocosmic level to its root: how we act toward one another rather than how we think about one another.  The social contract by which we Americans live with one another here and how we live with those abroad depends more on how we abide by our agreements than on whether we agree on all our respective values and objectives.  If it didn't sound overly religious, I'd say Mr. Patterson's column could be summed up by the phrase ''Do unto others as you would have others do unto you,'' long held by major religious and secular ethicists as the basis of good living.  Irv Rubenstein  Nashville, Dec. 26, 2006  To the Editor:  I agree that what sincerity ''means for us today is that the best way of living in our diverse and contentiously free society is neither to obsess about the hidden depths of our prejudices nor to deny them, but to behave as if we had none.''  But is it not possible that by being civil and sincere, we one day also become ''authentic''? Doing changes to being.  Ginger Nathanson  Long Valley, N.J.  Dec. 26, 2006  To the Editor:  This last year has given us apologies from Mel Gibson, Michael Richards, George Allen and Terrell Owens, as well as numerous other celebrities and politicians. The common thread is the disassociation between the ''real'' person that each individual is ''inside'' (or claims to be) and the bad behavior that each has displayed in words and actions.  Some of these individuals have gone so far as to say he did not know who it was that was speaking or acting in such a despicable manner.  I am not sure how one can have such inner goodness and purity of heart and behave so badly. All I know is that I am judged by my actions and can know others only by how they behave. That is accountability. That is the foundation of a civil society.  Bob Hoot  Middleton, Wis., Dec. 26, 2006  To the Editor:  Turn on the television or the radio and listen to the emotional discourse that passes for rational thinking. One hears the irrational voice that used to be kept private.  Is this a failure of our education to impart the knowledge and confidence one needs to be mature? Or is it a product of our drifting in an ocean of overcommunication?  Whatever it is, our need now is to take back our private self and return rational thinking to the public self.  Hendrik E. Sadi  Yonkers, Dec. 26, 2006  To the Editor:  Years ago, I read an article in The New York Times about a man who had a mean and miserly nature. He knew this and tried to counteract his nature by acting warmly and generously toward others.  On his deathbed, people lauded him as a philanthropist and friend to humanity. Within himself, he still felt mean and miserly, but his deeds proclaimed otherwise.  The point of that article, as of Orlando Patterson's column, is that the effect you have on others is the important part of your essence. You are defined by your actions, not by your sometimes more ignoble inner thoughts.  Barbara Preschel  New York, Dec. 26, 2006  ",

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, a proposed public-private project for which money is being raised by the LSST Corporation (www.lsst.org), plans to study time-lapse images of stars distorted by gravitational lensing, with the gravity coming from invisible dark matter.  ''According to Einstein, gravity warps both space and time,'' explained Alan J. Friedman, consulting senior scientist for the New York Hall of Science. Small objects like Earth ''produce only a modest warping of space and time.''  ''But massive galaxies of stars,'' Dr. Friedman said, ''or large amounts of dark matter warp space and time around them so much that any light rays that happen to pass through these warped spaces are visibly bent, smeared around, even split up, so it might seem they came from multiple directions.''  The result, he said, is that light from a distant galaxy may appear in telescopes to be coming from several galaxies, but all with exactly the same characteristics. When scientists see this, they know the light from the distant galaxy must have passed through warped space before getting to them, he said. They can measure the distortion to calculate what matter is causing it, even if that warping matter is completely dark.  C. CLAIBORNE RAY  Q & A  ",

The man, Eric McCoy, 37, stopped a 27-year-old woman on Dec. 4, planted a packet of what appeared to be marijuana in her bag and threatened to arrest her if she did not accompany him, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Then, on Tuesday, he stopped a 17-year-old, told her that he was an investigator and said she needed to accompany him for questioning, Mr. Brown said. Mr. Brown said that Mr. McCoy forced the women to have sex with him under threat of being arrested. He was held pending arraignment on charges of rape, criminal impersonation and other offenses.  ",

Fradkov, announced that Russia had agreed to lower significantly an export duty on oil to Belarus. Russia had imposed a duty of $180 per ton on oil shipped to Belarus, but agreed to lower it to $53 after the conflict prompted a halt in supplies to Europe through the Druzhba, or Friendship, pipeline, according to news accounts. Belarus on Wednesday agreed to drop a tit-for-tat fee it had imposed in response to Russia's new duty, causing Russia to close the pipeline. Belarus has refined subsidized Russian oil and resold it at significant profit. Belarus will continue to receive a subsidy, but Mr. Fradkov said the new agreement, which appeared to end the dispute between the countries, would still raise $1 billion for Russia.

                    "text": "  Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage house, capped a record earnings season for the major brokers yesterday by announcing a 68 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit.  Merrill's results, like those of its peers, were propelled by a buoyant market for mergers and acquisitions, especially buyouts, and strong results from trading and principal investments.  With the fourth-quarter results in, banks up and down Wall Street are looking more like Goldman Sachs, the competitor that everyone may love to hate but tries to imitate.  At Goldman, where fourth-quarter profit soared 98 percent, more than 64 percent of its profit last year came from trading and principal investments.  Merrill Lynch's results are starting to reflect that trend.  In the fourth quarter, investment banking and principal transactions, including net interest profit, constituted 57 percent of total net revenue, compared with only 45 percent of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005.  ''Trading has become a bigger part of Wall Street's business,'' said Jeffrey Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners.  Over all, Merrill earned $2.35 billion, or $2.41 a share -- sharply higher than forecasts -- compared with $1.37 billion, or $1.41 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The firm also increased its dividend 40 percent, to 35 cents a common share.  Merrill shares fell $1.41, to $95.40 in trading yesterday.  On a conference call with investors, Jeffrey N. Edwards, Merrill's chief financial officer, said the results put Merrill on ''the strongest competitive footing ever as we enter 2007.''  Later, in an interview, he said: ''The most encouraging thing is the continued growth in the pipeline. It's up from the third quarter and is the highest period end pipeline we have ever had.''  For the year, Merrill reported record net earnings of $7.5 billion, up 45 percent from the previous year, on record revenue of $34.7 billion.  For the fourth quarter, trading and investment banking reported revenue of $5.4 billion, up 55 percent from the quarter a year ago and up 21 percent from the third quarter. Fixed-income revenue was up 70 percent, to $2.3 billion, while equity revenue increased 49 percent, to $1.8 billion.  Debt and equity underwriting surged, but strategic advisory services dropped a surprising 18 percent from the previous year to $286 million. Revenue in the Global Private Client business, part of global wealth management, increased 10 percent, to $3.1 billion.  Merrill attracted $22 billion in new client money, up from $17 billion a year ago, bringing total assets managed to $1.5 trillion.  ",

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  In her review of Robert Richardson's biography of William James (Dec. 17), Rebecca Newberger Goldstein misunderstands James's concept of ''the divided self,'' which is central to his interpretation of religion. Concerned to highlight the connection between James's personal experience and his philosophical views, she describes James as a ''deeply divided man'' because he wasted much time trying to decide what profession to pursue. She then claims that he defined the divided self as a ''technical term in psychology,'' implying that it means merely a self struggling to make a decision.  The fact is that the divided self is for James an essentially religious concept describing the inner turmoil and division so well expressed by the anguished words of St. Paul -- ''The good I would, I do not, and that I would not, that I do, O wretched man that I am.'' James rightly saw this as the confession of human sin, the conflict between the self that knows what ought to be done and the same self acknowledging its inability to do it. That the divided self had basically religious significance for James is shown in two of his other examples -- St. Augustine and John Bunyan -- each of whom has left us vivid accounts of his own grappling with the divided self that defines the human predicament in biblical religion.

But they were faced with counterpoint arguments not only from Democrats but also from other Republicans. ''What I'll be doing is trying to appeal to my Republican colleagues to not pass a nonbinding resolution that basically says to the troops who are going there this is a mission that doesn't have a chance of succeeding,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS.  But on the same program, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said, ''I cannot support sending additional troops to Iraq.''  On ''This Week'' on ABC, Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said the resolutions were ''not helpful'' to the new American commander, Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, or ''to the troops, to the Iraqis.''  On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, a Republican presidential contender, said he was considering voting for a resolution criticizing the plan. That resolution also lays out benchmarks for the Iraqis to achieve and states that the Senate's intention is not to countermand the president's authority as commander in chief.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has passed a more harshly worded resolution criticizing the plan. Its backers include Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.  ",

                    "text": "  With his proposal to uproot a tax break that has been in place for more than 60 years, President Bush has touched off an impassioned debate over the future of the employer-based system that provides health insurance to more than half of all Americans.  ''Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans,'' Mr. Bush said in his State of the Union address this week.  Mr. Bush said his proposal would eliminate a bias in the tax code that strongly favored insurance provided by employers over coverage bought by individuals and families outside the workplace.  Paul Fronstin, director of health research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization, said: ''The president's proposal would mean the end of employer-based benefits as we know them. It gives employers a way out of providing the benefits because their employees could get the same tax break on their own.''  Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, denied that the president wanted to move people away from the employer-based system and toward the individual insurance market. ''We are seriously agnostic on that,'' he said.  It might take years for changes to occur. ''Large corporate employers could not immediately terminate their health benefits because there is, at present, no reliable place where employees can get coverage they can afford outside the workplace,'' said Frank B. McArdle, a health policy expert at Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm.  The economic rationale for Mr. Bush's proposal is that too many people have ''gold-plated, deluxe'' health insurance, which encourages them to use excessive amounts of health care, driving up costs for everyone.  Many economists agree. But they doubt that Mr. Bush's proposal would do much to hold down costs or cover more people.  ''The president's proposal addresses inequities in the tax code that provide an open-ended subsidy for premiums paid by employers,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''If your employer does not provide health insurance and you have to buy it on your own, you get no tax benefit at all. The president's plan would eliminate that distinction.''  But Mr. Reischauer said, ''A glaring problem with the president's plan is that he did not call for any stronger regulation of the individual insurance market.'' In that market as it now exists in most states, insurers can deny coverage or charge higher rates to sick people.  In their desire to achieve universal coverage, some Democrats have also begun to raise questions about the employer-based system. ''We have to ask ourselves if the employer-based system of health care is still the best way for providing insurance to all Americans,'' said Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, noting that workers frequently changed jobs.  The Service Employees International Union negotiates with employers to secure health benefits for its members, but the president of the union, Andrew L. Stern, said, ''The current employer-based health care system is not the foundation for 21st-century health care reform.''  Mr. Bush's proposal differs radically from President Bill Clinton's plan for universal coverage, but experts on health benefits said they were similar in one respect: In an effort to help the uninsured -- about one-sixth of the population -- they would upend the system that covers most Americans.  The Clinton plan would have provided comprehensive health benefits to 39 million uninsured Americans, with more than $400 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. The White House says the tax changes proposed by Mr. Bush would provide coverage for 3 million to 5 million people at no cost to the government over 10 years.  Since Mr. Bush took office in 2001, the number of people without insurance has increased by more than 5 million, to 46.6 million, according to the Census Bureau. Administration officials said they hoped to reverse that trend by helping states that offered basic private insurance policies to their residents. To pay for such help, the administration would take federal money from hospitals that serve large numbers of poor people.  Under Mr. Bush's proposal, employee health benefits would, for the first time, be treated as income and would be subject to income and payroll taxes, just like wages. At the same time, Mr. Bush would create a tax deduction for health insurance of $15,000 for families and $7,500 for individuals. The same deduction would be available to everyone with coverage, regardless of the source or value of the policy.  A family with coverage worth $18,000 would have to pay taxes on the amount exceeding the $15,000 standard deduction -- $3,000, in this example.  Katherine Baicker, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said the proposal would increase taxes for 30 million people with the most generous employer-provided health benefits, unless they ''change their behavior'' and choose less costly coverage. Ms. Baicker said the proposal would cut taxes for more than 100 million people who bought insurance on their own or had employee health benefits worth less than the standard deduction.  Treasury officials said that under the Bush proposal, an uninsured family of four with an annual income of $60,000 would save $4,545 if it bought coverage in the individual market. By contrast, they said, a family that earns $80,000 and has employer-provided coverage worth $20,000 could see a tax increase of about $1,500.  Joel D. Kaplan, deputy chief of staff at the White House, acknowledged that the proposal could accelerate the trend of employers' dropping health benefits for employees. But he said more people ''would be able to buy insurance in the individual market,'' so there would be ''a net increase in the number of insured.''  Politicians and health care providers are skeptical.  Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, said, ''The president's proposal would do little to help the uninsured, but would undermine the employer-based system through which 160 million people get coverage.''  Richard J. Umbdenstock, president of the American Hospital Association, agreed. ''The tax proposal would have the effect of driving people to the small-group insurance market -- a market that has proved unstable,'' Mr. Umbdenstock said. ''For many people, even with a tax break, coverage would remain unaffordable.''  Historically, employers have used benefits as a tool to recruit workers and keep them healthy and productive.  R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, praised the general direction of the president's proposal but said his members had serious concerns.  First, Mr. Josten said, the $15,000 cap on tax-free insurance takes no account of wide geographic variation in the cost of health care and insurance. The same package of benefits typically costs more in Boston than in Minneapolis, for example.  Moreover, Mr. Josten said, a health plan may be expensive because it covers older workers with major medical problems, not because it is ''gold-plated.'' A single mother, working as a low-paid secretary at a law firm, could be pushed into a higher tax bracket because she participates in an $18,000 health plan covering older men who have had heart attacks and expensive surgery, Mr. Josten said.  Treasury officials acknowledged that some people with costly, comprehensive benefits had modest incomes.  But deluxe health plans are vanishingfast. In recent years, many workers have found themselves paying more for less comprehensive benefits. From 2000 to 2006, premiums for employer-sponsored coverage rose 87 percent, about four times as fast as workers' earnings, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ",

                    "text": "  Bosch's search of the radiation victim's clothes has yielded no cesium. It turns out that he's Mexican, and Agent Walling tries to connect him to the Middle Eastern terrorists, who were believed to have entered the United States through the Mexican border. But Bosch isn't convinced.  Harry Bosch knew that the physics of traffic would not work for him in the Cahuenga Pass. The Hollywood Freeway always moved slowly in both directions through the bottleneck created by the cut in the mountain chain. He decided to stay on surface streets and take Highland Avenue past the Hollywood Bowl and up into the pass. He filled Rachel Walling in along the way.  ''The call for paramedics came from a print shop on Cahuenga near Lankershim. Gonzalves must have been in the area when he collapsed. The initial call said a man was down in the parking lot. I'm hoping that the Toyota he was driving is right there. I'm betting that if we find it, we find the cesium. The mystery is why he had it.''  ''And why he was foolish enough to put it unprotected in his pocket,'' Walling added.  ''You're basing that on him knowing what he had. Maybe he didn't. Maybe this isn't what we think it is.''  ''There's got to be a connection, Bosch, between Gonzalves and Nassar and Elfayed. He probably brought them across the border.''  ''We'll see.''  He almost smiled. He knew she had used his last name as a term of endearment. He remembered how she used to do that.  He took the ramp up to Cahuenga from Highland. It ran parallel to the freeway, and as soon as he checked, he saw that he had been right. The freeway was frozen in both directions.  ''You know, I still had your number in my cell's directory,'' he said. ''I guess I never wanted to delete it.''  ''I was wondering about that when you left me that mean message today about the cigarette ash.''  ''I don't suppose you kept mine, Rachel.''  She paused a long moment before answering.  ''I think you're still on my phone, too, Harry.''  This time he had to smile, even though he was back to being Harry with her. There's hope after all, he thought.  They were approaching Lankershim Boulevard. To the right it dropped down into a tunnel beneath the freeway. To the left it ended at a strip mall that included the Easy Print franchise from which the call to paramedics had originated. Bosch's eyes searched the vehicles in the small parking lot, looking for a Toyota.  He glided into the left-turn lane and waited to pull into the lot. He swiveled in his seat and checked the parking along both sides of Cahuenga. The quick glance showed no Toyotas, but he knew the brand had many different car models and pickup trucks. If they didn't find the car in the print-shop lot, they would have to work the curbside parking to look for it.  ''Do you have a plate or any description?'' Walling asked. ''How about a color?''  ''No, no and no.''  Bosch remembered then that she had the habit of asking multiple questions at once.  He made the turn on yellow and pulled into the lot. There were no parking spaces available, but he wasn't interested in parking. He cruised slowly, checking each car. There were no Toyotas.  ''Where's a Toyota when you need one?'' he said. ''It's got to be in this area somewhere.''  ''Maybe we should check the street,'' Walling suggested.  He nodded and nosed his car into the alley at the end of the parking lot. He was going to turn left to turn around and go back to the street. But when he checked to see if he was clear on the right, he saw an old white pickup truck with a camper shell parked half a block down the alley next to a green Dumpster. The truck was facing them, and he couldn't tell what make it was.  ''Is that a Toyota?'' he asked.  Walling turned and looked.  ''Bosch, you're a genius,'' she exclaimed.  Bosch turned and drove toward the truck, and as he got closer, he could see that it was indeed a Toyota. So could Walling. She pulled out her phone, but Bosch reached across and put his hand on it.  ''Let's just check it out first. I could be wrong about this.''  ''No, Bosch, you're on a roll.''  But she put the phone away. Bosch pulled slowly past the pickup, giving it a once-over. He then turned around at the end of the block and came back. He stopped his car 10 feet behind it. There was no plate on the back. A cardboard ''Lost Tag'' sign had been put in its place.  Bosch wished he had brought the keys he found in Digiberto Gonzalves's pocket. They got out and approached the truck, coming up on either side of it. When he got close, Bosch noticed that the rear-window hatch of the camper shell had been left open a couple of inches. He reached forward and pulled it up and open all the way. An air-pressure hinge held it open. Bosch leaned in close to look into the interior. It was dark because the truck was parked in shadow and the windows on the shell were darkly tinted.  ''Harry, you have that monitor?''  He pulled her radiation monitor off his belt and held it up in his hand as he leaned into the darkness of the truck's cargo hold. No alarm sounded. He leaned back out and put the monitor back on his belt. He then reached in to the latch and lowered the truck's rear gate.  The back of the truck was piled with junk. There were empty bottles and cans strewn everywhere, a leather desk chair with a broken leg, scrap pieces of aluminum, an old water cooler and other debris. And there by the raised wheel well on the right side was a gray lead container that looked like a small mop bucket on wheels.  ''Is that the pig?'' he asked.  ''I think it is,'' Walling said excitedly. ''I think it is!''  There was no warning sticker on it or radiation-alert symbol. They had been peeled off. Bosch leaned into the truck and grabbed one of the handles. He pulled it clear of the debris around it and rolled it to the tailgate. The top was latched in four places.  ''Do we open it and make sure the stuff is in there?'' he asked.  ''No,'' Walling said. ''We back off and call in the team. They have protection.''  She pulled her phone out again. While she called for the radiation team and backup units Bosch moved to the front of the truck. He looked through the window and into the cab. He saw more junk on the passenger side. His eyes held on a camera that was sitting on an old briefcase with a broken handle on the passenger seat. It didn't appear to be broken or dirty. It looked brand-new.  Bosch checked the door and found it unlocked. He realized that Gonzalves had forgotten about his truck and his possessions when the cesium started burning his body. He had gotten out and stumbled toward the parking lot seeking help, leaving everything behind and unlocked.  Bosch opened the driver's door and reached in with the radiation monitor. Nothing happened. No alert. He replaced it on his belt and walked back to his car. From the equipment kit in the trunk he got out a pair of latex gloves and put them on.  When he walked back past Walling, she was talking to someone about finding the pig. He moved back to the truck's cab. He leaned in and picked up the camera. It was a Nikon digital, and he remembered the lens cap found beneath the master bed at the Kent house by the SID team. He believed he was holding the camera that had taken the photograph of Alice Kent.  Bosch put the camera down and began looking through the things piled on the passenger seat. There was the broken briefcase, a child's lunch box, a manual for operating an Apple computer and a poker from a fireplace tool set. Nothing connected, and nothing interested him. He noticed a golf putter and a rolled-up poster on the floor.  He shifted his weight to one elbow on the armrest between the seats so that he could reach over and open the glove compartment. And there, sitting in the otherwise empty space, was a gun. Bosch lifted it out and turned it in his hand. It was a Smith & Wesson .22-caliber revolver.  ''I think we've got the murder weapon here,'' he called out.  There was no response from Walling. She was still at the back of the truck talking on her phone, now issuing orders in a hurried voice.  Bosch returned the weapon to the glove box and closed it, deciding to leave the weapon in its place for the forensics team. He noticed the poster again and decided for no reason other than curiosity to take a look at it. He unrolled it across all of the junk on the passenger seat. It was a chart depicting 12 yoga positions.  Bosch immediately thought about the discolored space he had seen on the wall in the workout room at the Kent house. He wasn't sure, but he thought the dimensions of the poster would match that space. He quickly rerolled the poster and started to back out of the cab so he could show Walling his discovery.  But as he was pulling out, he noticed that the armrest was also a storage compartment. He stopped and opened it.  He froze. There was a cup holder and in it were several steel capsules resembling bullet cartridges closed flat on both ends. The steel was so polished it almost looked like silver.  Bosch moved the radiation monitor over the capsules in a circular pattern. There was no alarm. He turned the device over in his hand and looked at it. He saw a small switch on its side. With his thumb he pushed it up. A blaring alarm suddenly went off, the frequency of tones so fast that it sounded like one long, ear-piercing siren.  Bosch jumped back out of the truck and slammed the door shut. The poster fell to the ground.  ''Harry!'' Walling yelled. ''What?''  She rushed toward him, closing her phone on her hip. Bosch pushed the switch again and turned the monitor off.  ''What is it?'' she yelled.  Bosch pointed toward the truck's door.  ''The gun's in the glove box and the cesium's in the center compartment.''  ''What?''  ''The cesium is in the compartment under the armrest. He took the capsules out of the pig. That's why they weren't in his pocket. They were in the center armrest.''  He touched his right hip, the place where Gonzalves was burned by radiation. The same spot would have been next to the armrest compartment if he was sitting in the truck.  Rachel didn't say anything for a long moment. She just stared at his face.  ''Are you O.K.?'' she finally asked.  Bosch almost laughed.  ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Ask me in about 10 years.''  She hesitated as if she knew something but couldn't share it.  ''What?'' Bosch asked.  ''Nothing. You should be checked out, though.''  ''What are they going to be able to do? Look, I wasn't in the truck that long. It's not like Gonzalves, who was sitting in there with it.''  She didn't answer. Bosch handed her the monitor.  ''It was never on. I thought it was on when you gave it to me.''  She took it and looked at it in her hand.  ''I thought it was, too.''  Bosch looked back at the truck and wondered if he had just hurt or killed himself.  ''I need a drink of water,'' he said. ''I've got a bottle in the trunk.''  Bosch walked to the back of his car. Using the open trunk lid to shield Walling's view of him, he leaned his hands down onto the bumper for support and tried to decipher the messages his body was sending to his brain. He felt something happening but didn't know if it was something physically occurring to him or just the emotional response -- the shakes -- to what had just happened. He suddenly thought of his daughter, getting a vision of her at the airport the last time he saw her.  He cursed out loud.  ''Harry?''  Bosch looked around the trunk lid. Rachel was walking toward him.  ''The teams are headed this way. They'll be here in five minutes. How do you feel?''  ''I think I'm O.K.''  He reached into the trunk and got a liter bottle of water out of his kit. It was an emergency bottle he kept for surveillances that dragged on longer than expected. He opened it and took two strong pulls. The water wasn't cold, but it felt good going down. His throat was dry.  Bosch recapped the bottle and put it back in the kit. He stepped around the car to Walling. As he walked toward her he looked past her to the south. He realized that the alley they were in extended several blocks past the back of the Easy Print and ran behind all the storefronts and offices on Cahuenga. All the way down to Barham.  Every 20 yards or so there was a green Dumpster positioned perpendicular to the rear of the structures. Bosch realized that the Dumpsters had been pushed out of spaces between the buildings and fenced corrals. It was pickup day, and the Dumpsters were waiting for the city trucks to come.  Suddenly it all came to him. Like fusion. Like two elements coming together and creating a new element. It all came together for Bosch in that moment. The thing that bothered him about the photos, the yoga poster, everything. The gamma rays had shot right through him, but they had left him enlightened. He knew. He understood.  ''He's a scavenger.''  ''Who is?''  ''Digiberto Gonzalves,'' Bosch said, his eyes looking down the alley. ''It's collection day. The Dumpsters are all pushed out for the city trucks. Gonzalves is a scavenger, a Dumpster diver, and he knew they would be out and this would be a good time to come here. ...  ''And so did somebody else.''  ''You mean he found the cesium in a Dumpster?''  Bosch nodded and pointed down the alley.  ''All the way at the end, that's Barham. Barham takes you up to Lake Hollywood. Lake Hollywood takes you to the overlook. This case never leaves the page.''  Walling came over and stood in front of him, blocking his view. Bosch could hear sirens in the distance.  ''What are you saying? That Nassar and Elfayed took the cesium and stashed it in a Dumpster at the bottom of the hill? Then this scavenger comes along and finds it?''  ''I'm saying you've got the cesium back, so now we're looking at this as a homicide again. You come down from the overlook, and you can be in this alley in five minutes.''  ''So what? They stole the cesium and killed Kent just so they could come down here and stash it? Is that what you're saying? Or are you saying they just threw it all away? Why would they do that? I mean, does that make any sense at all?''  Bosch noted that she had asked six questions at once this time, possibly a new record.  ''Nassar and Elfayed were never near the cesium,'' he said. ''That's what I'm saying.''  He walked over to the truck and picked the poster up off the ground. He handed it to Rachel. The sirens were getting louder.  She unrolled the poster in her hands and looked at it.  ''What is this? What does it mean?''  Bosch took it back from her and started rolling it back up.  ''Gonzalves found that in the same Dumpster he found the gun and the camera and the lead pig.''  ''So? What does it mean, Harry?''  Two fed cars pulled into the alley a block away and started making their way toward them, weaving around the Dumpsters pushed out for pickup. As they got close, Bosch could see that the driver of the lead car was Jack Brenner.  ''Do you hear me, Harry? What does it --''  Bosch's knees suddenly seemed to give out and he fell into her, throwing his arms around her to stop himself from hitting the ground.  ''Bosch!''  She grabbed on and held him.  ''Uh ... I'm not feeling so good,'' he mumbled. ''I think I better. ... Can you take me to my car?''  She helped him straighten up and then started walking him toward his car. He put his arm over her shoulders. Car doors were slamming behind them as the agents got out.  ''Where are the keys?'' Walling asked.  He held the key ring up to her just as Brenner ran up to them.  ''What is it? What's wrong?''  ''He was exposed. The cesium is in the center console in the truck cab. Be careful. I'm going to take him to the hospital.''  Brenner stepped back, as if whatever Bosch had was contagious.  ''O.K.,'' he said. ''Call me when you can.''  Bosch and Walling kept moving toward the car.  ''Come on, Bosch,'' Walling said. ''Stay with me. Hang in there and we'll get you taken care of.''  Bosch almost smiled. She had called him by his last name.  Next week: Reeling from exposure, Bosch fingers the wrong man.

                    "text": "  The McCormick Tribune Foundation, the second-largest shareholder in the Tribune Company, said yesterday that it had hired a buyout firm to advise it on a course of action while the Tribune Company is on the block.  The foundation's five directors are all current or former members of the Tribune Company management and could influence the company's decision whether to sell some or all of its assets. The foundation and the company said they had taken steps to avoid any conflicts of interest.  A person close to the process said bids for the company were due Jan. 17. Its assets include The Los Angeles Times, 10 other newspapers, two dozen television stations and the Chicago Cubs.  Joseph A. Hays, a spokesman for the foundation, said it had hired the Blackstone Group buyout firm as part of its fiduciary responsibilities because 75 percent of the value of the foundation is in Tribune stock. Blackstone is to review the company's financial information and advise it on a course of action.  ''It's a full range of opportunities, from standing pat to divesting stock to acquiring stock, and in between there is infinity,'' Mr. Hays said.  The McCormack Foundation, founded at the death of Col. Robert R. McCormick in 1955, finances an array of charities. It has an 11.7 percent stake in Tribune. The Cantigny Foundation, which is associated with the McCormick Foundation and owns 1.4 percent of the shares, has joined in retaining Blackstone.  Tribune's biggest shareholder is the Chandler family, which owns 20 percent and has expressed interest in buying the company.  The foundation said it had set up a special advisory committee of two of its five board members to direct Blackstone's work. Those two -- James C. Dowdle and John W. Madigan -- are retired Tribune executives. The other three are current members of the Tribune Company management: Dennis FitzSimons, chairman and chief executive; Scott C. Smith, president of Tribune publishing; and David Hiller, publisher of The Los Angeles Times. Colonel McCormick stipulated in his will that the foundation's directors be current or former officers of the Tribune Company, but that has raised questions of potential conflicts of interest.  Daniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a watchdog group in Chicago, said it was not clear where the board's interests began and the company's interests left off. He said it was unusual for a foundation to have so much of its assets invested in one company. He also questioned whether only two of the five directors could decide the foundation's course of action, given that they do not constitute a majority.  In a regulatory filing yesterday, the foundation said that the three current executives ''have been isolated from this process on behalf of the foundation,'' referring to the potential sale of Tribune. In addition, Mr. FitzSimons sent an internal note to employees saying, ''Given our role as current officers of the company, Scott, David and I have voluntarily recused ourselves from any deliberations regarding alternatives'' for the foundation's investment in the Tribune Company.  Mr. Hays said that Mr. Madigan owned stock in Tribune and that Mr. Dowdle did not. He said Mr. Madigan's stock ownership did not pose a conflict because ''his interests are aligned with the foundation.''  Until recently, Mr. Madigan was a special partner at Madison Dearborn, a private equity firm that is considering a bid for Tribune; the firm said yesterday he had left to avoid any appearance of a conflict.  Late in the day, the foundation said it was receiving so many questions about its intentions in establishing an advisory committee that it issued a statement saying the move ''should in no way be construed as a reflection on the management of Tribune Company.'' The committee, it said, ''continues to have complete confidence in Tribune Company management.''  As a philanthropic organization, the foundation could not make a bid itself for Tribune because it has no cash. But it could participate in a deal with a private equity firm or another company. ''This is where a financial adviser would be helpful,'' a person close to the process said.  The Chandlers started the process that led to the auction of the Tribune Company when they expressed displeasure last year at the company's slumping stock price and said management was muddled. The Tribune Company said it would examine its strategic options, including the sale of part or all of its assets.  Correction:  January 6, 2007, Saturday  A picture caption in Business Day yesterday about a decision by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, a large shareholder in the Tribune Company, to hire the Blackstone Group as an adviser while the Tribune is up for sale, misstated the role of the company's chief executive, Dennis FitzSimons, in the sales process. Mr. FitzSimons, who is also chairman of the foundation's board, has recused himself from issues regarding the sale; he is not a member of the special committee dealing with the Blackstone Group.  ",

                    "text": "  Introduced on Sunday: Chevrolet Volt design study  Is it real? Not now. Not next year. But General Motors will be ready when the batteries are.  What's the point? Plug-in hybrids have been the buzz among environmentalists, so G.M. set its engineers to building the best possible example -- a theoretical 150-mile-a-gallon car, complete with an onboard generating station.  What they said: ''Here it is, a fully electric-drive car from G.M. I am shocked -- I am truly shocked,'' said Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman of General Motors. ''It proves that environmentally conscious cars can actually look good.''  What they didn't say: This vehicle must wait for the battery of the future, not today's cumbersome and somewhat fragile energy storage systems.  What makes it tick? A small three-cylinder gas engine drives only a 53-kilowatt generator -- it is not connected to the wheels at all. The charge is stored in a long lithium-ion battery pack that runs down the middle of the car. A 160-horsepower electric motor moves the front-wheel-drive Volt, giving 0-60 acceleration of 8.5 seconds and a theoretical range of 640 miles. The car can also be plugged in to a standard wall outlet for a 6.5 hour recharge.  How much, how soon? No production estimates, no prices given. G.M. says the battery technology is expected to be available around 2010.  How's it look? Sleek and coupe-like, the Volt shows some of the design edge that characterizes Cadillac, with the sport sensibility of the Saturn Sky. The Chevrolet bow-tie logo was particularly prominent; one G.M. executive said informally that the Chevy badge was meant to show the Volt was a global concept.  ",

NATO said up to 150 insurgents might have been killed in the fighting.  Two large groups of insurgents were spotted gathering on the Pakistan side of the border and were tracked as they crossed into Afghanistan, NATO said in a statement released in Kabul.  Afghan Army soldiers and NATO troops laid an ambush for the groups about half a mile inside Afghanistan, using air and ground forces, said Gen. Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.  The insurgents were in trucks loaded with men and weapons and crossed the border about 2 a.m., General Azimi said. Afghan and NATO forces set up an ambush in a deserted area near the border, he said. He reported no Afghan or NATO casualties, but estimated that about 80 insurgents were killed. The clash occurred in the Barmal district of Paktika Province, which borders the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, one of the most lawless areas of the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Militants from both countries, along with hundreds of foreign fighters, operate Taliban training camps there and mount frequent attacks across the border into Afghanistan.  The Pakistani military guards the border but has failed to stem cross-border attacks; NATO officials say there has been a marked increase in infiltration at the border since September compared with last year.  ''Pakistani military liaison officers were kept fully informed throughout the operation,'' NATO said in its statement.  ",

                    "text": "  Introduced on Monday: Changfeng Liebao CS7  Is it real? Since 1999, Changfeng has been churning out Mitsubishi-based S.U.V.'s and pickups for China and other markets, but not the United States, Japan or Europe. The CS7 is its latest concept S.U.V.  What's the point? To crush Detroit's spirit and suck out its manufacturing soul. Just kidding -- though automakers in Detroit, Europe and Japan are tripping over themselves to strike partnerships with companies like Changfeng to manufacture cars in China.  What they said: Liebao means cheetah in Chinese, and as the company's inspiring video noted, ''The cheetahs are leaping into the new century.'' Li Jianxin, the company's chairman, noted Chanfeng's rapid 10-year transformation from a small military repair company to China's No. 1 seller of S.U.V.'s, with more than 23,000 sales in 2006.  What they didn't say: No word on when Changfeng might cross the Great Wall between  it and buyers in the United States. Company officials acknowledge the brand must overcome hurdles, including setting up a dealer network and meeting pollution and safety standards.  What makes it tick? A Mitsubishi-derived 2-liter 114-horsepower engine delivers power to a four-wheel-drive system.  How much, how soon? Liebao may sell a similar production model around 2008  in China, Africa, South America and other markets, for roughly $15,000.  How's it look? Sitting on the display stand in the cellar of Cobo Hall, it looked like a rejected Kia design, circa 1995, rescued from a Seoul wastebasket and smuggled to Hunan.  ",

Its sitcom ''Two and a Half Men'' outdrew ''Heroes'' and ''24'' in its half-hour at 9 (16.1 million), while ''CSI: Miami'' (18.7 million) dominated the 10 p.m. hour. ABC was fourth over all.

                    "text": "  The Indianapolis Colts, the team of Peyton Manning and the franchise that once had the legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas, probably never thought they would rely on a formula like this to win in the playoffs: Let the defense stop the opponent, have the place-kicker score all the points, and hope the offense does not make too many mistakes.  Who did they think they were -- the Baltimore Ravens? The Ravens, the team that brought football back to Baltimore, patented that game plan when they won the Super Bowl in 2001. But the Colts borrowed a page from that playbook Saturday, beating the Ravens, 15-6, to advance to next Sunday's American Football Conference championship game.  The Colts, for years the N.F.L.'s most dazzling offense, won in the most unexpected fashion -- without scoring a touchdown and by allowing fewer than 10 points for the second time in the playoffs. They have made their way through the playoffs without the white-hot spotlight and the staggering weight of outside expectations bearing down on them. Manning, whose postseason struggles have threatened to blemish his career r\u00e9sum\u00e9, has thrown five interceptions and only one touchdown pass in the past two games.  But if the New England Patriots defeat the San Diego Chargers in Sunday's A.F.C. playoff game, the Colts will play host to the championship game -- a perk they were supposed to enjoy last year, when they were the overwhelming favorite to reach the Super Bowl.  In the waning moments of the victory, after Adam Vinatieri had nailed his fifth field goal, Colts Coach Tony Dungy stood beside defensive tackle Anthony McFarland. Dungy and McFarland had been together in Tampa Bay, too, when the Buccaneers' repeated playoff runs were foiled by a terrible offense. The Bucs fired Dungy for his failure to win a title and he was quickly hired by the Colts, who hoped he would build a defense that would be a complement to Manning's offense.  With two smothering defensive efforts in the playoffs so far, Dungy seems to be fulfilling his mandate at precisely the moment when Manning has stumbled. So, on the sideline, Dungy and McFarland christened the Colts' victory: Call it Buc-ball.  ''We won a lot of games like this,'' Dungy said of his Buccaneers. ''We were having a laugh. These guys are all nervous. Every game we won, we won like this. It's Ravens ball. We outplayed them at their game.''  Actually, the Ravens have never had a quarterback like Manning. But the arrival of quarterback Steve McNair, who once shared league most valuable player honors with Manning, energized the offense and created a balance with the defense that propelled the Ravens to the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C.  But on Saturday both offenses were virtually beside the point. This was just the fourth time in N.F.L. history, and the first since 1979, that neither team scored a touchdown in a playoff game. The Ravens had the best defense in the league this season, but Manning said he could not recall, in his nine seasons in the N.F.L., ever winning a game without scoring at least one touchdown.  Except for the outcome, this was a forgettable performance for him. Scrambling to avoid pressure, Manning frequently overthrew his receivers. He was intercepted twice while completing only 15 of 30 pass attempts, statistically an even worse day than McNair had, with his two interceptions and 18-of-29 passing. Manning's 39.6 quarterback rating was nearly as bad as the 35.5 rating he posted when the Patriots battered the Colts in the 2005 A.F.C. championship game.  ''The plan coming in was to score touchdowns,'' Manning said, laughing. ''We were not planning to score 35 points, but we thought maybe 20 points. I knew it would be tough sledding.''  But Manning completed the most important pass of the game, in the middle of a clock-chewing fourth-quarter drive that kept the ball out of the Ravens' hands when they were trailing by only 6 points. On third-and-5 from Baltimore's 45, Manning zipped a pass to tight end Dallas Clark, who was blanketed by Ravens cornerback Corey Ivy.  At the most critical moment, the Ravens' defense could not make a stop. The Colts' defense, particularly against the run, was shredded for most of the regular season, but with the return of safety Bob Sanders from an injury that forced him to miss almost all of the regular season, the Colts have had consecutive lockdown performances. They held the Chiefs' Larry Johnson to 32 yards rushing last week, then held the Ravens to 83. They thwarted Baltimore's preferred style to get an early lead and then unleashed blitzes.  The Ravens never had the lead because the Colts had the one weapon they lacked last season: a reliable field-goal kicker. The Colts signed Vinatieri away from the Patriots expressly for games like this.  Last season ended for the Colts when Mike Vanderjagt badly missed a field goal in the divisional round. The league's most dynamic offense, and the improving defense, could do nothing to replace those 3 points, so the Colts replaced Vanderjagt as soon as free agency started with Vinatieri, one of the most clutch kickers in N.F.L. history.  Vinatieri has had plenty of highlight-reel moments, none more memorable than his successful field goals in a blizzard against the Oakland Raiders that propelled the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title. But if the Colts go to the Super Bowl, Vinatieri might have provided an omen to their postseason.  His third field goal of the game, late in the second quarter, was a 51-yarder. He did not hit it well and the ball seemed to die as it got near the goal post. It barely hit the cross bar and with its last bit of momentum, it bounced over.  It was not pretty, but it got through. Just like the Colts.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

The attack occurred as Afghan laborers were lining up for security checks at the pedestrian entrance of the base known as Camp Salerno. The bomber was trying to enter the base, NATO said, but detonated the vest when he reached the search point.  Arsalah Jamal, the Afghan provincial governor of Khost, visited the scene after the bombing and confirmed the deaths of eight civilian laborers and two Afghan security guards, though a NATO statement put the toll at six Afghan civilians and two policemen.  ''I confirm 10 people, including two Afghan security guards, were killed in a suicide attack at the entrance of the military base,'' Mr. Jamal said.  He said 14 others had been wounded in the attack, all Afghan civilian daily workers for the military base. NATO said only five had been wounded.  Khost, in eastern Afghanistan, borders tribal areas in Pakistan that Afghan and Western officials contend offer a haven for militants organizing suicide attacks.  ''Suicide attack is not an Afghani phenomenon,'' Mr. Jamal said by telephone. ''There are madrasas and camps on the other side of the border where some elements promise passport and visa'' to ''young people for killing themselves and others.''  The attack was one of the deadliest since Sept. 30, 2006, when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the gates of the Interior Ministry in Kabul, killing 12 people and wounding up to 40.

                    "text": "  A new study suggests that having many siblings may increase the risk for certain stomach cancers and that younger siblings may be more at risk than older ones.  Researchers gathered blood samples from 7,429 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii from 1967 to 1975 to determine whether they were infected with Helicobacter pylori, a childhood infection known to increase the risk for stomach cancer much later in life. They followed the men for 28 years, during which 261 developed gastric cancer.  From that group, the researchers selected the cases of those infected with H. pylori -- 239, or 92 percent -- and compared them with a group of cancer-free, but also infected, controls. The team then looked at family size and birth order in both groups.  Among the cases with the most the virulent strain of H. pylori, called cagA, those from families with seven or more children were more than twice as likely to develop cancer as those from families with one to three children, and younger children had a higher risk than older ones.  The study appears in the January issue of PloS Medicine.  ''It's remarkable that something that's happening in the early years of life affects the risk of a cancer happening seven decades later,'' said Dr. Martin J. Blaser, the lead author and a professor of medicine at New York University. ''It's my hypothesis that this may be a model system for other cancers.''  The authors acknowledge that some factor other than family size or birth order may be the cause of the findings. But they suggest that the germ is transmitted among siblings, and that the immature immune systems of younger children may make them more susceptible.  VITAL SIGNS: AT RISK  ",

Virgin Classics 332626 2; CD.  THE Capu\u00e7on siblings -- led by Renaud, 30, a violinist, and Gautier, 25, a cellist -- are a relatively recent but noteworthy addition to the current Who's Who in musical families. The brothers demonstrate their rich, powerful tone, fine ensemble playing and wide range of repertory on their new disc, ''Inventions.''  It includes arrangements of some of Bach's Inventions and English and French suites by Frederick Neumann, which the Capu\u00e7ons play with flair, precision and minimal vibrato.  But the disc also includes intriguing pieces originally written for violin and cello. The Jewish Communist composer Hanns Eisler, a student of Schoenberg, was an outcast in both Nazi Germany and McCarthy-era America. The Capu\u00e7ons play his rhythmically intense, dissonant Duo for Violin and Cello, a gritty, ironic and passionate work written in 1924, with conviction.  The French composer Karol Beffa, 33, dedicated his enigmatic, melodic and melancholy ''Masques I'' and ''Masques II'' to the Capu\u00e7on brothers, who play it with introspection and dramatic vigor. Sandwiched between the two ''Masques'' are Karl Kraeuter's transcriptions of Bartok's Hungarian Folk Songs, a cheery respite from Mr. Beffa.  The Jewish composer Gideon Klein completed his solemn and chromatic Duo for Cello and Violin, which echoes Berg and Schoenberg, in 1939. The unfinished Lento ends in midphrase: an eerie foreshadowing of Klein's death in a concentration camp in 1945.  It is handy for any musical family to have a pianist in the ranks, and the Capu\u00e7on brothers are joined by their sister, Aude, for a flirtatious rendition of Kreisler's ''Marche Miniature Viennoise,'' which concludes the disc on a lighthearted note.

Prosecutors say Mr. DeVecchio, who was responsible for managing confidential informants, played a role in four killings between 1984 and 1992 by giving information to the Colombo crime family. In April, Mr. DeVecchio's lawyers sought to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the evidence was subject to federal grants of immunity and that his defense was based on federal law. But Judge Frederic Block ruled that Mr. DeVecchio had not presented a valid argument.  MICHAEL BRICK  ",

                    "text": "  AMERICAN FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  SEEDING --1  TEAM -- San Diego Chargers (West champions)  The Chargers have won 10 in a row, including the finale over Arizona to clinch home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs. If the seedings hold up, their first game could be a doozy: against New England, whose coach, Bill Belichick, would surely try to confuse quarterback Philip Rivers in his first playoff game, and whose solid run defense would give LaDainian Tomlinson one of his biggest challenges of the season.  RECORD -- 14-2  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 2  TEAM -- Baltimore Ravens (North champions)  Baltimore beat Buffalo yesterday, using its fifth interception return for a touchdown to secure the second seeding and a first-round bye. The Ravens have won four in a row and their offense has been energized since Brian Billick took over the play-calling. But a run in the playoffs will still be all about their top-rated defense. Baltimore held the Chargers to 13 points in October to hand San Diego its first loss.  RECORD --13-3  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 3  TEAM -- Indianapolis Colts (South champions)  The Colts held off the Dolphins yesterday to secure the third seeding, but the Dolphins, playing a meaningless game, moved down the field with ease late in the fourth quarter, a bad omen for Indianapolis. The defense is not as good as it was last year, and the Colts will go only as far as their porous run defense - the worst in the league - allows them. The Chiefs have a star running back in Larry Johnson, and that could mean another early exit for the Colts.  RECORD -- 12-4  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Kansas City  SEEDING -- 4  TEAM -- New England Patriots (East champions)  After an erratic season, the Patriots go into the playoffs on a roll after pounding Vince Young (five sacks, three turnovers) and the Titans yesterday. They remain an intimidating playoff opponent because of Tom Brady, who has had a superb season despite a dearth of receiver talent. But the Jets held the Patriots to 14 points in Foxborough in November.  RECORD -- 12-4  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Jets  SEEDING -- 5  TEAM -- Jets  The Jets defeated the Raiders yesterday to secure a wild-card spot, completing a remarkable rookie regular season for Coach Eric Mangini, who took over a team that won only four games last season. The Jets started looking like a serious threat when they beat the Patriots in Foxborough in mid-November. Now they are going back for another visit, another chance for Bill Belichick to offer Mangini a warm welcome back.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- New England  SEEDING -- 6  TEAM -- Kansas City Chiefs  The Chiefs snuck in when the Broncos lost to the 49ers in overtime yesterday and Pittsburgh beat Cincinnati. The Chiefs survived Trent Green's severe concussion in the season opener because they leaned heavily on running back Larry Johnson. Coach Herman Edwards will no doubt do that again when he faces his friend Tony Dungy's suspect run defense.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Indianapolis  NATIONAL FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  SEEDING -- 1  TEAM -- Chicago Bears (North champions)  The Bears wrapped up the top seeding long ago on the strength of their dominating defense, rendering last night's game against the Packers meaningless. But the Bears still have not answered the biggest question about a potential run to the Super Bowl: What happens if quarterback Rex Grossman struggles? It is a question that could shape the postseason for the N.F.C., especially if the Bears face the Saints, who have a top-five pass defense, in the conference championship game.  RECORD -- 13-3  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 2  TEAM -- New Orleans Saints (South champions)  The Saints, the feel-good story of the season, may also be the most dangerous team in the N.F.C., and after their decimation of the Giants in Week 15, everyone knows it. Drew Brees, Reggie Bush and Deuce McAllister rested for most of the Saints' meaningless loss to the Panthers yesterday. Bush versus Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher in the conference championship would be a blockbuster.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE  SEEDING -- 3  TEAM -- Philadelphia Eagles (East champions)  The Eagles finished the season with five consecutive victories behind the backup quarterback Jeff Garcia, who has been so effective leading a balanced offense that Donovan McNabb's mother is worried about her injured son's future. The Eagles defeated the Giants, 36-22, just two weeks ago, and they seem to be getting stronger and more confident by the week. Their offense, improbably, is in the top five in the league.  RECORD -- 10-6  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Giants  SEEDING -- 4  TEAM -- Seattle Seahawks (West champions)  The Seahawks blew out the Buccaneers in their season finale, but they had lost three in a row before that. They are nowhere near the powerhouse team that went to the Super Bowl last season. And the final game was costly: Cornerback Kelly Herndon broke his left ankle (another cornerback, Marcus Trufant, didn't play because of a sprained ankle) and linebacker Leroy Hill sustained a concussion.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Dallas  SEEDING -- 5  TEAM -- Dallas Cowboys  Less than a month ago, the Cowboys had a two-game lead in the N.F.C. East and looked like the best team in the conference. But yesterday, with a chance to win the division, they lost to the Lions at home, their third loss in their final four games. Quarterback Tony Romo was voted into the Pro Bowl, but he has struggled in those three losses. Seattle's Qwest Field is one of the loudest, most difficult stadiums in the league. Seattle's secondary is injury-riddled, so the complaining Dallas receivers should get plenty of action.  RECORD -- 9-7  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Seattle  SEEDING -- 6  TEAM -- Giants  The Giants survived a near-complete collapse and rediscovered their offense to sneak into the playoffs with almost no momentum. They played the Eagles close for a while two weeks ago, but their defense was gashed up the middle by the Eagles' rushers. Earlier in the season, the Giants forged an epic comeback to beat the Eagles in Philadelphia. But that was a long time ago, and if they beat the Eagles next week, it will be an even greater comeback for the season.  RECORD -- 8-8  1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Philadelphia  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Adam Gillitt does not hate what is on his TV as much as he dislikes what is attached to it.  Mr. Gillitt, a graphic designer from Alameda, Calif., is exasperated by his high-definition cable box, made by the technology giant Motorola and leased to him by his local cable provider, Comcast. The $10-a-month device, he says, has a poorly designed electronic program guide and responds slowly, or not at all, to commands from the remote control.  ''Paying for something this awful hurts,'' Mr. Gillitt said.  For many Americans, the cable box -- still commonly called the set-top box, though it is now too big to balance on top of increasingly thin TVs -- may be the most disappointing piece of technology in their homes. As inventions like TiVo and YouTube alter the way people watch and control video, the traditional box has largely failed to keep up.  Now that is beginning to change.  At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, makers of set-top boxes exhibited devices with a host of new features: more hard-disk space for storing digitally recorded TV shows, easier-to-navigate program guides, connections to Web sites, DVD burners and video games.  The box manufacturers and the cable operators like Comcast, Cox and Time Warner Cable that they sell to, have an age-old motivation for improving their products: fear. New competitors are flooding into the TV business, including the industry's rivals in the telephone business, and the computer kingpins Microsoft and Apple.  Consumers can buy those alternatives at regular retail outlets, including the newest high-definition version of TiVo. It sells for $800 (with a $20 monthly fee) and can replace the box that cable and satellite providers lease to customers, instead of merely sitting on top of it and adding to living room clutter.  Cable operators are being forced to play nice with these new entrants. The Federal Communications Commission has set a deadline of July 1 for all cable operators to make their services work with boxes from all third-party manufacturers, and last week it rejected a request from Comcast to extend the deadline.  ''Set-top boxes are becoming the central piece of equipment in the home for accessing entertainment and information,'' said Joshua Goldman, chief executive of Akimbo, a Silicon Valley start-up trying to bring programming to the TV over the Internet. ''Consumers will buy their own device if they feel like they are not getting the services they want from their television operators.''  For decades, the cable industry did not worry much about introducing new features into their typically black set-top boxes. They faced little competition in their local markets and bought their equipment from one of two companies: General Instruments, which was purchased by Motorola in 2000, and Scientific Atlanta, acquired by Cisco Systems in 2005.  Both companies build TV boxes according to the specifications of cable companies, who lease them to customers and then make their money on monthly subscriptions. Because they are essentially giving the boxes away, the industry's focus, not surprisingly, is on keeping the cost of the equipment low.  But now new players are offering more sophisticated alternatives to cable boxes. Over the last two years, 30 million personal computers have been sold with Media Center software from Microsoft, which enhances video viewing on the PC, making it more like a television. The computers come with a remote control and can pause and fast-forward through video.  Many of those PCs can now replace set-top boxes, thanks to a federal law passed over a decade ago that requires cable operators to sell credit-card-size devices called CableCards. These cards can plug into a Media Center PC, or other consumer electronics appliances like DVD players, allowing them to receive regular cable channels.  Last week, Apple also joined the fray with Apple TV, a slick silver box that connects to the television and displays programs and movies that have been downloaded from iTunes. It goes on sale next month for $299.  The message to cable companies and their equipment vendors is clear: if they want to keep up, they must build a better cable box.  They appear to be listening. At the Las Vegas show, just as many visitors swarmed around Motorola's new set-top boxes as its latest mobile phones. The company showed a line of new boxes compatible with high-definition TV, with one-third more hard-disk space than its previous models, like the clumsy device Mr. Gillitt has under his TV.  The new boxes are designed to offer greater control over the television. For example, one new feature Motorola is promoting is called ''program restart.'' If cable customers miss a show by a few minutes and do not record it, they can click a button and get the cable company to retransmit it directly to them, instantly. Time Warner Cable is currently testing the service in San Antonio.  Padmasree Warrior, the chief technology officer of Motorola, said consumers now demand more from their televisions, largely thanks to TiVo, which has forced the cable companies to ask suppliers for more innovative set-top boxes. ''Enough people are experienced with time-shifting that there's a demand that the industry dynamics change,'' Ms. Warrior said.  Across the showroom floor, Scientific Atlanta executives agreed that the old featureless TV tuner was quickly becoming a relic. Among its new boxes, the company showed off one called the MCP-100: a silver set-top box with a digital video recorder and one surprising new feature: a slot for DVDs. In addition to getting live TV, the device can play movies and burn programs and movies onto discs. It is now being tested by cable companies.  Scientific Atlanta is also building Internet connections into all its boxes, so consumers can get programming from the Web in addition to the traditional ways, by cable or satellite.  ''There's a growing need for high-quality video that goes right to where it's supposed to, the television, and not to the PC, where only college kids are looking at it,'' said Robert C. McIntryre, Scientific Atlanta's chief technology officer.  The cable companies and their equipment vendors must adapt to the Internet age quickly, because soon customers will have more choices than ever. Telephone companies like AT&T and Verizon are investing heavily to bury fiber optic cables in most major cities and roll out their own TV offerings.  Because the telephone companies deliver television using Internet standards and typically package it with telephone and Internet service, they say they can offer consumers more choices and control over the viewing experience. AT&T, for example, showed off a set-top box at the Las Vegas show that received four different streams of programming (compared with most new digital cable boxes, which receive only two). That allows a customer to watch a program live while simultaneously recording three others.  One new feature that AT&T was showing, called picture-in-picture browsing, or PIP, lets a TV viewer channel surf on a small screen while continuing to watch another program on the rest of the screen.  AT&T hopes to have its TV service, called uVerse, accessible to 19 million homes by the end of next year. If it can pull it off, it would position AT&T as a serious rival to cable and satellite television providers.  All of these established companies also have to watch out for smaller rivals with their own set-top box innovations. TiVo's Series3 HD Digital Media Recorder, which went on sale last fall at electronics stores like Best Buy, is CableCard-ready, which means buyers can plug in a card from their local cable operator and use it as a substitute for a cable box.  Another technology start-up at the show, Digeo, exhibited its new Moxi service, a set-top box with digital video recorder that it plans to start selling in the latter half of this year. The Moxi also works with a CableCard and comes with smaller optional ''Moxi mates,'' which buyers can connect to the other TVs in their homes. Those televisions will then have access to the programming received by and recorded on the primary set-top box.  Digeo's chief executive, Mike Fidler, said increased competition was ushering in a renaissance in set-top-box design. ''Companies can now come in with innovative products that change the consumer experience and bring a whole new level of enjoyment to television,'' Mr. Fidler said.  ",

                    "text": "  As part of their 100-hour legislative blitz, House Democrats are expected to vote today to increase the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, to $7.25 an hour, in a move that economists say will raise pay for 13 million workers.  The bill's chances are less certain in the Senate, largely because of friction over a Republican push to include tax breaks for small business in the bill. Senate Republicans have hinted that, without such tax cuts, they will filibuster the measure, a move that the bill's supporters would need 60 votes to overcome.  The legislation would lift the federal wage floor, currently $5.15 an hour, to $7.25 in three steps between now and 2009.  ''Minimum-wage workers desperately need a raise,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. ''It is a moral outrage that millions of Americans who work full time still live in poverty.''  After opposing a minimum-wage increase for years, many Republicans now say they favor one, but only if it is coupled with a tax cut for restaurants and other small businesses -- the groups they say would be hurt most by the wage increase.  ''The Democrat leadership's unbalanced proposal may increase the minimum wage, but it leaves small businesses and their workers to fend for themselves,'' said Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, the ranking Republican on the Education and Labor Committee.  On Tuesday, Mr. McKeon and Jim McCrery of Louisiana, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced a competing minimum-wage bill that includes billions of dollars in tax breaks. One such break would allow faster depreciation for newly built restaurants, allowing them to record the building cost on financial statements over 15 years instead of the current rule of 39 years, and thus lower taxes.  President Bush has said he might accept a higher minimum wage, but only if it is tied to tax cuts to soften the blow for business.  Some Democrats and many of their liberal and labor allies assert that the minimum wage should not be used as an excuse to give more tax breaks to business.  ''For the past 10 years, Republican leaders have held the minimum wage hostage,'' said the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney. ''Corporations and wealthy Americans have gotten their rewards. Now it's time to do the right thing for low-wage workers, with no payoffs to business.''  Frustrated by Congress's inaction, 28 states have adopted minimum wages above the federal floor, affecting 70 percent of the work force.  In an unusual move for a minimum-wage bill -- typically it is handled by the House and Senate labor committees -- the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing today on the bill.  ''To call a minimum-wage increase 'overdue' is the understatement of the year,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the committee's chairman. ''This Congress promised to raise the minimum wage, and we will. We also need to pass meaningful small-business incentives along with a wage increase. We can do both, and we will.''  Many economists, especially conservative ones, insist that raising the minimum wage would not reduce poverty, saying it would ultimately reduce the number of jobs for low-skilled workers. But other economists, especially liberal ones, say a higher minimum would have virtually no effect on job levels while it lifted the pay for millions of low-wage workers.  ''The increase will make a big difference for someone who makes the minimum wage -- you're talking about thousands of dollars a year in extra earnings,'' said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, and one of the economists scheduled to testify before the Finance Committee. ''It's important to remember that if you don't have a binding wage floor, a lot of workers are going to end up disconnected from the improving economy and that's exactly what's happened.''  Mr. Bernstein's institute estimates that six million workers earn less than $7.25 an hour, but workers earning a dollar or two more than that can also expect to see their wages increase if a new minimum is enacted.  Joseph Sabia, a professor of consumer economics at the University of Georgia, said an increase would do little to lift workers out of poverty.  ''Most people who earn the minimum wage are not poor or near poor,'' Professor Sabia said. ''If the goal is to help the working poor, it would be better to raise the earned-income tax credit,'' which refunds cash to poor workers.  The traditional economists' view has been that a higher minimum wage would mean some job losses for low-wage workers. But a landmark 1994 study by David Card and Alan Krueger upset the common wisdom by finding that there were no overall job losses when New Jersey raised its minimum wage.  David Neumark, a longtime critic of that study and an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, said most credible studies had concluded that an increase in the minimum wage did hurt employment for unskilled workers, although most studies did not find major job reductions. He said an increase to $7.25 might reduce job levels for the least skilled workers by 4 percent.  ''The most affected workers are the ones you'd most like to help,'' Professor Neumark said. ''If the workers who get raises are middle-class teenagers and the ones who lose jobs are unskilled workers in poor jobs, you can increase poverty.''  Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, acknowledged that there might be some job losses, but he said that they would be minor and would be far outweighed by the wage gains.  ''Minimum-wage earners are concentrated in the bottom half of families by income,'' Professor Holzer said.

                    "text": "  MERGERS and acquisitions have been booming, and investors looking for a way to profit from them have a simple solution at hand: they can invest in mutual funds that specialize in buying shares of companies that are being acquired.  But don't expect to make a killing. These funds -- and there are at least five of them -- are generally considered to be having a good year if they double the returns on three-month Treasury bills. Last year, the five funds returned 10.1 percent, on average, while T-bills averaged less than 5 percent, but still gained far less than the nearly 16 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Over five years, the funds' return was 5.5 percent, annualized, compared with 6.2 percent for the S.& P.  Mainly, the funds offer extremely consistent gains from a highly diverse portfolio, and at the end of a year investors almost always have more than they did in January. Consider the Merger Fund, the oldest and biggest at $1.5 billion. It has had only one losing year out of 17. The Gabelli ABC fund, the second-oldest and third-largest with $193 million in assets, is a perfect 13-0.  ''What we do is fairly straightforward,'' said Frederick W. Green, president of the Merger Fund. ''We're the sleep-well-at-night fund.''  The gains come from buying shares in a company that is being acquired, but for less than the acquirer plans to pay, then cashing out when the deal is done. Because, as Mr. Green says, 95 percent of the mergers are completed, generally within a matter of months, it's a pretty safe bet that buyers will earn the difference, or spread, between the two prices.  The favorable odds go a long way toward explaining why merger or risk arbitrage, as the strategy is known, produces returns that tend to be lower, on average, than those of other stock investments.  Investors trying to buy the shares after a merger announcement can't expect to get the stock for much less than the acquirer's offer, because the current shareholders can reasonably count on getting that price shortly. How much less depends on a number of factors for both buyer and seller -- for example, what their money could reliably earn in another investment, like three-month Treasury bills, or the value attached to the 1-in-20 possibility that the deal will fall through (say, over regulatory problems).  When mergers are plentiful, as they are now, fund managers can pick their targets more carefully than usual. And with interest rates having edged higher, the spreads have widened between the post-announcement market price and the offer price.  At times, some merger funds will short the stock of the acquirer as well as buy shares in the target company. The tactic is similar to that used by hedge funds engaged in arbitrage, though without black-box secrecy or the risk of leveraging. The price of the acquirer's shares tends to slip after the offer is made, so shorting those shares is a way to improve returns.  The five-year-old AXA Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions fund, the second-largest fund with $304 million in assets, adds a much riskier arbitrage strategy to the mix. One-third of its capital is invested in companies that Mario J. Gabelli, the veteran money manager who oversees the fund along with his namesake ABC fund, regards as having the potential to be acquired. For example, three companies in which he invests as takeover candidates are U.S. Cellular, Sensient Technologies and Cadbury Schweppes.  Potential takeover targets in general are more speculative investments than the traditional arbitrage plays. If the main appeal of a company is its takeover potential and no offers materialize, its stock price may fall and give the fund a loss. On the other hand, if the company is taken over, the fund gets the full measure of the premium the acquirer pays. Such gambles increase risk, but may also improve total returns dramatically over the standard arbitrage performance -- as was the case in 2006 with AXA Enterprise.  For the year, according to Morningstar, AXA Enterprise gained 15.2 percent, more than three percentage points ahead of Gabelli ABC, the runner-up, at 12 percent. They were followed by the Merger Fund, at 11 percent; the year-old, $7 million QCM Absolute Return fund, at 7 percent; and the six-year-old, $84 million Arbitrage fund, at 6.1 percent.  But while 2006 was a good year for the funds, not even AXA Enterprise quite caught up with the S.& P. index, which returned 15.8 percent for the year. Over one-, three- and five-year stretches, the returns of the group averaged several percentage points below those of the S.& P.  Another concern is cost. Four of the funds have expense ratios that are higher than the mutual fund average of 1.27 percent, according to S.& P. (And Enterprise has a front-end load, or sales charge, of 4.75 percent.)  The exception is Gabelli ABC, whose ratio is half the average. But its minimum initial investment is $10,000 (though down from $50,000 in 2005), versus $2,000 or $2,500 at the other funds. And investors can buy it only through Gamco Investors, Gabelli ABC's money management parent.  There are also taxes to consider. ''These funds deal in short-term trades, so if they make money there are going to be capital gains to pay,'' says Russel Kinnel, director of research at Morningstar. ''They're better for retirement portfolios.''  Mr. Kinnel also says that these funds' returns may be squeezed over the long run by competition from hedge funds. As the number of hedge funds increases and their war chests grow, more dollars are likely to be chasing a shrinking number of deals, since merger mania can't be expected to continue forever. The growth in competition may be a compliment to the arbitrage strategy, but spreads would be likely to narrow, thus hurting the performance of all arbitrage funds.  Zo\u00eb Brunson, director of portfolio services at S.& P., suggests that if investors are convinced that the good times for mergers will continue, and want to profit directly, they have alternatives to arbitrage funds. They might try small-cap funds, she said.  ''You get your exposure to mergers and acquisitions because that's where a lot of them are,'' she said. ''You may take on more risk, but there's greater upside potential.Not that they're better. It's just a matter of what you have an appetite for.''  MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT  ",

                    "text": "  Folic acid dietary supplements significantly improve thinking skills that tend to decline with normal aging, a Dutch study has found.  Researchers randomly assigned 818 men and women ages 50 to 70 to take a daily oral dose of 800 micrograms of folic acid or a placebo. All the subjects, who were otherwise healthy, had elevated blood levels of homocysteine, which has in previous studies been associated with poor cognitive performance.  All the subjects took five tests of mental functioning. At the beginning of the study, there was no significant difference in the scores between the groups. But at the end, after controlling for cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass, smoking status and other variables, the folic acid group performed significantly better on three of the five mental tests, and their average for all tests was significantly higher.  Although the lead author, Jane Durga, affirmed that the study was carefully randomized and controlled, she said, ''Based on this paper alone, I wouldn't be waving it around'' to urge people to supplement their diets.  ''Although this is a high-quality study,'' she continued, ''it needs to be repeated in other populations like in the U.S., where there is already folic acid fortification.''  By law, flour in the United States is fortified with folic acid to help prevent neural tube defects in newborns.  ''This is only the first study that shows this effect,'' Dr. Durga said. ''There need to be studies that look at lower doses or increasing natural folates, which may lead to similar or even greater effects.''  At the time of the study, published on Jan. 20 in The Lancet, Dr. Durga was a nutritional epidemiologist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.  VITAL SIGNS: MENTAL ABILITIES  ",

                    "text": "  Skoto Gallery  529 West 20th Street, Chelsea  Through Jan. 27  As one of New York's very few full-time commercial spaces devoted mainly to contemporary African art, Skoto Gallery is worth keeping an eye on. Its present show is a strong solo by the Congolese-born artist Aime Mpane, who divides his time between Kinshasa and Brussels.  Skoto's front gallery is given over to large sculptural installations that address Western pillaging of Africa, military and cultural, that gained full force in the late 19th century and continues. In one piece a tiny sculptural figure of a European soldier casts a huge drawn shadow on the gallery wall. In another, shown at the 2006 Dakar Biennial, the life-size figure of an African man, made entirely from matchsticks, stares at a grave marked 1885, the year Africa was definitively carved up and distributed among several European nations.  Even with colonialism ended, the mining of African culture continues, as suggested in a third sculpture, of the German artist and self-declared shaman Joseph Beuys kissing African feet. Some of the continuing effects of a disastrous past are evident in dozens of small paintings hung salon-style in the gallery's back room, all done during one of Mr. Mpane's recent stays in Kinshasa.  Most were painted at night by firelight or candlelight in a city short of electricity. (Mr. Mpane could fully see the paintings only hours after they were done, in daylight.) They are images made, like the whole show, of shadow and light, and they are extraordinary.  HOLLAND COTTER  ART IN REVIEW  ",

                    "text": "  Although it has been a decade since the Museum of Modern Art's giant Jasper Johns retrospective, there have been a spate of smaller shows devoted to aspects of his work. Now the National Gallery of Art in Washington has put its own spin on his oeuvre with ''JASPER JOHNS: AN ALLEGORY OF PAINTING, 1955-1965,'' which opens today.  Not wanting it to seem like either another retrospective or a survey show, Jeffrey Weiss, the gallery's curator of modern and contemporary art, has traced this artist's work through four motifs: the target, the mechanical device, the stenciled naming of colors and the imprint of the body.  Included in the show will be 84 works from public and private collections, including the largest group of target paintings ever assembled. Among them is ''Target With Plaster Casts'' (1955), which is the image on the cover of the show's catalog. It has been lent by David Geffen, the entertainment mogul. Also on view will be many of Mr. Johns's most famous works, like ''False Start'' (1959), which now belongs to the Chicago collector Kenneth C. Griffin, and ''Jubilee'' (1960). Through April 29; nga.gov.  An exhibition devoted to another popular American artist, ROBERT GOBER, opens Saturday at two of the Matthew Marks Galleries in Chelsea. Like Mr. Johns, Mr. Gober is known for using familiar vernacular American forms in his work.  Consisting of only new works -- two sculptures and several drawings -- the exhibition will feature a sculpture of a plastic milk crate filled with sculptures of Granny Smith apples that rests on a cast of a wooden footstool in the space at 526 West 22nd Street. A block away, at 521 West 21st Street, will be a second cast of a wooden footstool, this one made with an old packing blanket folded on the seat. Through March 10; (212) 243-0200.  ",

                    "text": "  Before the great pyramids, ancient Egyptian kings left less grandiose monuments to themselves: fortresslike sanctuaries enclosed by mud-brick walls. Inside these mortuary complexes, people presumably gathered to worship and perpetuate the memory of their departed ruler.  The crumbling, almost vanished remains of such structures, archaeologists say, attest to the political hierarchy and religion of the newly unified Egyptian state, beginning more than 5,000 years ago. As symbols of the early power of kings and their roles in the cosmic order, these mysterious funerary centers are considered ancestral in purpose to the classic pyramids of Giza.  The last and largest of the cult centers -- the only major one still standing in clearly recognizable form -- was erected for King Khasekhemwy, who ruled in the second dynasty around 2780 B.C. Known today as Shunet el-Zebib, the two-acre enclosure stands on a desert plain at Abydos, 300 miles south of Cairo near the burial grounds of early Egyptian rulers.  Now, in an ambitious effort to preserve this ruin, archaeologists, engineers and teams of artisans and laborers are shoring up the walls and gates of Shunet el-Zebib, ravaged by time and the elements and in danger of imminent collapse.  Officials of the project said in recent interviews that the work over the last two years had been slow and careful, but was at least halfway completed. More than 250,000 mud bricks, made on the scene from an ancient recipe, have been laid to build up the high walls. It has cost $1 million, and an equal amount is being raised to finish the job.  ''We are not trying to restore the original structure, producing a kind of Walt Disney thing,'' said David O'Connor, an Egyptologist at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. ''We are preserving and stabilizing it as it is in a way that reflects its nearly 5,000-year history.''  Dr. O'Connor, director of the preservation work, has conducted excavations at Abydos that have exposed the ruins of eight such enclosures. He suspects there are one or two others yet to be discovered.  British archaeologists investigating the site more than a century ago described the enclosures as fortresses, but more recent excavations, particularly at the one dedicated to Khasekhemwy, revealed the association with royal mortuary practices. Even so, owing to a dearth of inscriptions, archaeologists remain largely in the dark as to just what went on inside these centers to memorialize the king in afterlife.  The rulers were not buried at these sites. The underground royal tombs at Abydos are a mile south of the excavated enclosures. Later kings were buried elsewhere inside pyramids, which adjoined stone temples where priests made offerings and conducted rituals for the king.  At Shunet el-Zebib, the pre-pyramid architecture represents a grandeur of purpose and an investment of time and labor signifying expanding royal power. High, thick double walls, more massive than for any previous mortuary complex, enclose a rectangular open space. Originally, the structure had four monumental gates and a whitewashed facade that glistened in the sun.  ''Most of these details have been lost or obscured by millennia of exposure, erosion and collapse,'' said Matthew Douglas Adams of N.Y.U., associate director of the project. ''But the enclosure itself still looms impressively over the surrounding landscape.''  The open area in the center could accommodate a multitude of people, though archaeologists are not sure if the public was allowed inside. Traces of small chapels have been uncovered inside the walls. Each was dedicated to a specific king.  In two such chapels at other enclosures, Dr. O'Connor said, remains were found of benches for statues or inscribed tablets, as well as evidence of spilled libations and burnt incense.  Writing in ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt,'' edited by Ian Shaw, Kathryn A. Bard, an Egyptologist at Boston University, said, ''The paramount role of the king is certainly expressed in these monuments, and the symbols of the royal mortuary cult which evolved at Abydos were to become further elaborated in the pyramid complexes'' of later dynasties.  Betsy M. Bryan, a professor of Egyptian art and archaeology at Johns Hopkins University, who is not involved in the project, said the Abydos enclosures and also one at another site on the Nile, Hierakonpolis, were important artifacts in serious danger.  The enclosures, Dr. Bryan said, ''provide great information not only about burial preparation but about elite religious beliefs on the eve of Egypt's 'big bang' -- the pyramid age.''  A generation after Khasekhemwy, King Djoser introduced burial pyramids. His tomb was the Step Pyramid (designed as a ''staircase to heaven'' for the king) near the ancient capital Memphis, outside modern Cairo. Scholars note that Djoser's burial complex incorporates significant aspects of the Abydos enclosures. The pyramid was surrounded by walls enclosing chapels.  It was in the 26th century B.C., a few generations later, that even more powerful kings erected the majestic pyramids at Giza, the last surviving of the so-called seven wonders of the ancient world.  In 2001, archaeologists grew concerned for the survival of the Shunet el-Zebib enclosure. They were alarmed to discover that the structure was in danger of collapse.  Some of the mud-brick walls still stood at close to their original height of 35 feet and thickness of 15 feet. But there were gaping holes where whole sections had caved in. The four gates were in ruins. Deep cracks and crumbling brick threatened further disintegration, Dr. Adams said.  The Abydos project, which also includes archaeologists from Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, called in American experts to decide what could be done to forestall further damage. The experts -- William Remsen, a preservation architect; Anthony Crosby, a specialist in mud-brick and earthen architecture; and Conor Power, a structural engineer -- recommended immediate action.  With financing from the American Research Center in Egypt and the United States Agency for International Development and permits from the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, workers began rebuilding some fallen walls and strengthening others. Brick makers from a nearby village were recruited.  An analysis of the ancient bricks revealed their original formula: two parts mud, one part sand mixed in water and sun-dried for two weeks. The replacement bricks, each stamped with PYIFA (for Pennsylvania, Yale and the N.Y.U. Institute of Fine Arts), now fill the most vulnerable sections of the old walls.  ",

                    "text": "  ''She's not going to be in the street, that's for sure,'' Geneva Burton said decisively as she nodded toward her granddaughter, Brittany Rivera, 14. There are drugs on the streets of their Bronx neighborhood, said Ms. Burton, 70. She lost her daughter to them and vowed not to lose her granddaughter, too.  ''My daughter got involved with drugs at an early age,'' Ms. Burton said. Her daughter, Dana Burton Rivera, was 16 when her mother noticed a change. She started on cocaine and wound up on crack, an addiction it pained Ms. Burton to witness. ''It was like she was kidnapped against her will,'' Ms. Burton remembered.  Brittany was born addicted to cocaine and spent seven weeks in the hospital before she was released to her grandmother. Brittany spent her early years with her grandmother, although her mother lived in the same building and was close by. ''I was 4 or 5 when I lived with my mother,'' Brittany said, ''and that week when I was 6.''  Brittany's mother, Ms. Rivera, got clean at 21. ''Squeaky clean,'' Ms. Burton said. ''When she left it, she left it for good.'' Brittany moved in with her a year or so later, and in January 1998 Ms. Rivera gave birth to twins. But while she had survived addiction, the years of drug abuse had taken their toll.  Ms. Rivera died suddenly, less than two weeks after Brittany's sixth birthday. She went into the hospital with back pain, and died from complications stemming from her years as an addict. ''August the 15th, my child was gone,'' Ms. Burton said. The twins just were 7 months old, and Ms. Burton was heartbroken. ''I loved her beyond human understanding,'' she said. ''They didn't come sweeter than her.''  Brittany now lives with her grandmother, and she carries her mother's high school graduation picture in her wallet. The likeness is striking. Brittany, pleasant and well spoken, is a freshman at St. Michael Academy, an all-girl Roman Catholic high school in Manhattan. Her first report card shows an 85 percent average and positive comments from teachers. On Wednesdays after school, she stays for Global Community, in which students discuss world events.  Catholic school is important to Ms. Burton. She hopes it will help keep her granddaughter safe. ''The environment is better,'' she said. ''Environment to me is very important. I don't see how you can separate a child from environment.''  She feels that the school will provide the discipline that Brittany needs to succeed. Brittany interjected, ''It's important to me -- I like the school.''  But paying for it is a challenge. High school costs $550 a month, and Ms. Burton has not managed to keep up. ''I can pay January,'' she said, but she has fallen about $1,000 behind since school began in September. Making ends meet on her retiree income is a continual challenge. Ms. Burton receives $1,200 a month from the New York Telephone Company, where she worked as an operator until 1991. She also receives $600 from Social Security. Brittany receives $154 a month in Social Security survivor benefits from her mother's death. Their rent is $919 a month, and public assistance covers $300.  After Ms. Burton fell behind on her Consolidated Edison bill in August, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, stepped in to help. It arranged a $200 energy grant from Con Edison, and used $95 of Neediest Cases money to prevent a turn-off. Ms. Burton has again fallen behind, and this month an additional $130 in Neediest Cases money was used to keep the power from being turned off. ''I'm grateful; it's going to help me a lot,'' Ms. Burton said.  This month, Ms. Burton goes to family court to seek custody of the twins, William Brandon Sykes and Breanna Geneva Sykes, who turned 9 on Saturday. Ms. Burton saw them regularly until last year, when their father went into drug rehabilitation. They have been living with their father's partner. ''I want them back in my life pretty regularly,'' Ms. Burton said.  Brittany is looking forward to being older and being able to go to the movies alone, and to talk to boys on the phone. ''Don't rush it, Brittany, it's coming,'' Ms. Burton said.  She is trying to teach her granddaughter as much as she can, now. ''I'm in the evening of my life; she's in the morning,'' she said. ''I'm not going to be with her always. I try to teach her the best I can.''  Ms. Burton is hoping that Brittany will make her way safely through their neighborhood and out into the world beyond. ''It's O.K. for me, you know, 'cause I'm pretty strong,'' she said. ''I want her to get a good education so she can move on.'' But it might take some outside help to keep her granddaughter in the school Ms. Burton thinks best.

                    "text": "  When Destiny-Rae was quiet at 18 months old, Delores Pryce knew that something was wrong. ''All my children talked early,'' she said. ''But she wasn't speaking.''  The problem, as Ms. Pryce discovered, was that her daughter could not hear. The fluid in her ears was not draining properly. An operation to install tubes to drain the fluid in each ear solved the hearing problem.  Today, as she turns 7 years old, Destiny-Rae is a chatty, bubbly first grader who likes to read. ''I read all kinds of books,'' she said.  Destiny-Rae's premature birth came with medical complications and a wrenching change of address that turned the lives of Ms. Pryce, now 43, and her family upside down.  In December 1999, Ms. Pryce was pregnant with Destiny-Rae and visiting New York with her three children, Misty-Lee, Keano-Ross and Marie-Chantal, then ages 3 through 10. She was on vacation from her native England after fleeing a tumultuous marriage. She had planned to return home shortly after the new year.  On Jan. 4, 2000, Destiny-Rae was born two months early. ''When she came out she was red and then, all of a sudden, she turned blue,'' Ms. Pryce remembered. ''She wasn't able to breathe.''  Destiny-Rae spent 16 days in the hospital and was released weighing little more than four pounds. Ms. Pryce was stranded in New York with four children, one of them a fragile newborn.  ''The hospital wouldn't let me fly home,'' she said.  The family was staying with friends, but the arrangement soured, leaving the entire Pryce family homeless. Ms. Pryce gathered her children and entered a Brooklyn shelter.  Destiny-Rae was in and out of Kings County Hospital Center five times before her first birthday, for pneumonia and other complications. Ms. Pryce and her three children traveled by subway from their Brooklyn shelter to visit her daily. The family lived in a shelter during the next four years. Destiny-Rae had emotional and behavioral issues, including hyperactivity, a sensitivity to touch and a quick temper.  Then, in September 2004, Tabernacle Church in Jamaica, Queens, offered a lifeline. Ms. Pryce had been a member of the Baptist congregation for three years. The church offered her a small two-bedroom apartment above its small worship space and set the rent at $250 a month.  ''It looked like a bomb hit it,'' Ms. Pryce said. ''We cleaned it up. We did our bit.'' The apartment today is furnished with worn, hand-me-down furniture. Amy and Patrick, the family parakeets, fly around the living room.  Destiny-Rae pointed to two paper certificates for perfect school attendance in October. ''This is Misty's perfect attendance; this is mine,'' she said.  Ms. Pryce lives here with Destiny-Rae and Misty-Lee, 10, who is in fifth grade. Her eldest daughter, 17, is in college in England, where students typically start college classes at 16. Her son, Keano-Ross, is living there with Ms. Pryce's parents and doing well in fourth grade.  The apartment was a huge step toward stability, but paying the electricity bill was a new hurdle.  ''They sent me a bill when I first came here and I paid that bill,'' Ms. Pryce remembered.  Then, she said, Consolidated Edison sent no bills for months. The Con Ed office is across the street from Destiny-Rae's weekly play therapy, and Ms. Pryce said that she inquired there regularly about her bill. She was told that Con Ed did not have her account information. About a year and a half later, she received a $1,600 electricity bill.  The family income is limited to $626 a month from Destiny's Supplemental Security income and supplemented by $152 in food stamps, and a $20 stipend from the church food pantry, where Ms. Pryce also volunteers twice a week. She also picks up baby-sitting jobs, and works one day a week at a neighborhood grocery.  Ms. Pryce managed to pay $500 toward the electric bill. But in October, Con Ed threatened to remove the meter, and she asked for help to pay the remaining balance.  She turned to Keiko Aizawa, a social worker at New Alternatives for Children, which provides preventive services for families with medically fragile children. The program is run by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  Ms. Aizawa, who has been involved with the family since Destiny-Rae's ear surgery more than five years ago, found money to pay off the remaining $1,100 on the electricity bill, $500 of which was Neediest Cases money.  ''You guys came through for me. I'm not going back in the shelter,'' said Ms. Pryce, who is grateful for Ms. Aizawa's continued support.  Things are looking up. Destiny-Rae receives physical, occupational and speech therapy each week and is catching up academically. ''By the age of 8 or 9, she should be up to par and out of special ed,'' Ms. Aizawa said.  Ms. Pryce hopes to find a full-time job now that two of her girls are in school here, and she said that she is finally beginning to feel more secure.  ''I've got the sense that I'm safe here,'' she said. ''Everything will be all right. They've got better as things have gone along.''  In her bedroom, Misty-Lee pulled out some princess decorations and pink paper wall hangings that Ms. Aizawa gave the girls a few months ago. ''We're going to put it up soon,'' she said.

Correction:  January 18, 2007, Thursday  An article on Jan. 4 about Delores Pryce, a Queens woman whose youngest daughter has health problems and who received help from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to help pay an electricity bill, referred incorrectly to New Alternatives for Children, a program that helps families with medically fragile children. (The error was repeated in an article on Jan. 5 about Dorcas Acheampong, a Bronx woman who received help from the fund to help pay her rent.) Although it is a member agency of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, it is not run by the federation.  ",

                    "text": "  MEXICAN blue wing butterflies defy stereotype. They prefer shade to sunlight. They are dark, not bright. They seek tree bark, rather than blooms. And they are one of the reasons Mel and Maris Midgley traveled from Gloucestershire, England, to southern Texas and the Lower Rio Grande Valley.  ''You can walk right up to them,'' said Ms. Midgley as she displayed a vivid image of the blue wing on her digital camera. ''You can't do that with a bird.''  Indeed, it is the kingfishers, green jays, kiskadees and other birds that thrive along the Rio Grande that make this 275-mile stretch of the river a prime destination for nature lovers. Some 500 bird species have been sighted in the four-county region, making it the most concentrated area in the United States for birds, according to experts. To a growing number of eco-tourists, the region is also the center of butterflying. Of the 700 varieties found in the United States, 300 alight here.  As rich as the region is for birders and butterfliers, some naturalists say the area is now threatened because of the border fence legislation signed in late October by President Bush to help curb illegal immigration. The details on just what such a fence would look like have not been made public yet, but environmentalists and people who depend on nature tourism, which brings an estimated $125 million to the area annually, are concerned.  ''A physical fence on the river doesn't make sense because the river is so winding, and it would eliminate the last remnant of the native riparian forest down here,'' said Keith Hackland, a local naturalist, noting that in some places the green corridor is only 50 to 100 feet wide. ''Even if birds and butterflies could fly over, they would have nowhere to fly to.''  Possible threats to the environment notwithstanding, the North American Butterfly Association is continuing to expand its flagship butterfly park in the Lower Rio Grande Valley town of Mission. ''This is the only place they could put a park like this,'' said Sue Sill, executive director of the park, which opened in 2002. ''We have butterflies 12 months of the year and see more butterflies than anywhere else.''  Monarchs and the similar species known as queens, crepe-paperlike yellow sulfurs, large black swallowtails and ornate red admirals swarm the five-foot-tall purple-flowered crucita bushes that have been planted on five acres of rehabilitated cotton and sorghum fields at the NABA International Butterfly Park. In the next two years, the organization expects to build a visitors' center designed by architect Wendy Evans Joseph and to replant more of the 100 acres it has acquired for the park. Already it's a destination for butterfliers like the Midgleys, who are former birders.  ''Most birders appreciate beautiful things. It's easy to turn them onto something like this,'' Mr. Midgley said. ''And you don't have to get up as early.''  Whereas birding is usually best at dawn and dusk, midday is prime time for viewing heat-loving butterflies. Late fall and winter are high season in southern Texas because butterfly migration and greater rainfall help the flowers that provide food for many species. Any butterfly safari here inevitably involves sharing the wild with birders, as my 7-year-old son, Seth, and I discovered in November. We signed up for a canoe trip on the Rio Grande along a stretch protected by the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge with Mr. Hackland and Cheryl Longton, a park volunteer guide.  ''There are so many butterflies now it's distracting,'' Ms. Longton said as we passed the park's butterfly garden.  ''That makes it hard to bird,'' said Allison Hilf, a birder from Denver in the group.  THE rio might have once been grand, but dams upriver have narrowed it considerably, to less than 200 feet wide in some places and as shallow as a foot in parts. Still, as the river wound through native forest of old-growth oaks festooned in Spanish moss and banks of tall riverside reeds, it seemed exotic beside the fields of kale and cabbage that bordered the reserve. Herons -- great blue, tricolored, green and night -- perched on downed limbs and flew away only when we came too near. Green and ringed kingfishers crisscrossed our canoes. There were periods of manic activity, when hundreds of dragonflies would patrol the river or flocks of swallows would swoop at insect hatches. Where flowering vines cascaded down from the trees, butterflies perched, warming their wings in the morning sun.  Hot-orange Julias and the cloisonn\u00e9 underwings of gulf fritillaries stood out boldly against the foliage, while small, brown American snouts and pale white peacocks hovered over the water.  ''Temperate meets tropical here, both in terms of vegetation and climate,'' Mr. Hackland said, noting that the Fish and Wildlife Service has identified 11 distinct biological communities in the region. ''Butterflies are a good indicator of that. You don't get great varieties without diverse vegetation. We have huge diversity here, including semidesert, riparian tropical forest, freshwater and saltwater. It's biologically one of the most diverse areas in the United States.''  An emerald green malachite butterfly, the kind of quarry butterfliers buzz about, flew over our van as it crested the levee, towing the canoes back to the visitors' center. ''This is what the rest of Texas looks like,'' Ms. Longton said, indicating the flat fields opposite the levee. ''Only 5 percent of the natural habitat is left.''  The Santa Ana refuge is part of a larger plan by Fish and Wildlife to string together nature preserves along the river to provide a wildlife corridor not only for birds and butterflies but for the endangered ocelot and other native animals. So far, 40,000 acres of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge are open to the public en route to an envisioned 132,500 acres bordering the final 275 miles of the river from Falcon Dam south to the Gulf of Mexico. But the entire project, critics say, is threatened by the proposed immigration fence.  ''Most people here are against it for social reasons. You don't want to put up a fence to keep out the neighbors,'' said Martin Hagne, director of the Valley Nature Center in Weslaco. ''It could wipe out all that habitat it has taken 20 years to develop.''  While specific designs for the fence remain a mystery, the Secure Fence Act calls for it to be completed by 2008 and for the Lower Rio Grande Valley portion to run from Laredo to Brownsville.  Jarrod Agen, a spokesman in Washington for the Department of Homeland Security, said yesterday that the agency would consider the concerns of environmentalists in any decision about the form of the wall, adding that cameras and sensors might prove more effective in a rural area. ''We are looking at a mix of physical barriers as well as technology to have have full surveillance of the border,'' he said.  Mr. Hagne and some other environmentalists are hoping the barrier will indeed be some type of virtual fence made up of electronic surveillance devices that would preserve the habitat, rather than a solid wall or fence, which, if built on the shore, might require clearing vegetation for patrol paths.  In one of the nation's fastest growing regions, eco-advocates already fight developers and agricultural interests for space. Butterflying and birding there require hopscotching from one nature preserve to the next in a central core of communities over 30 miles, from Mission in the west to Weslaco in the east, with the busy McAllen at the center. Vast farm fields and RV parks buffer sights that include the Edinburg Scenic Wetlands, the Valley Nature Center, Quinta Mazatlan and Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park, where we attended an evening ''owl prowl'' in search of nocturnal black witch moths and foraging javalina.  We found the navigating a do-it-yourselfers' dream, but the education was far greater when joined by Mr. Hackland, who correctly identified the least grebes, which we took for small ducks, differentiated the tawny emperor butterfly from the white peacock and picked out a great barbecue joint, Willie's, near Santa Ana.  Meanwhile, the local interest in wild things is expanding from birds to butterflies and, lately, to dragonflies. ''People start out with birds,'' observed Shane Mooneyham, a naturalist at Estero Llano Grande State Park in Weslaco, where we spot a bright red Needham's skimmer dragonfly in addition to a swallowtail butterfly. ''When they've seen all they can see, they go to butterflies. Then, dragonflies. It's the next natural pretty insect.''  ON THE WING  It's Always Butterflying Time  AMERICAN, Continental and Delta offer connecting service to McAllen/Miller International Airport, the most convenient airport in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

Correction:  January 19, 2007, Friday  An article last Friday about observing butterflies in the Lower Rio Grande Valley misstated the trees that are hung with Spanish moss there. Many indigenous trees, including species of elm and ash, have Spanish moss there, but oaks are not among them.  ",

                    "text": "  The North Carolina State Bar filed a second, more serious round of ethics charges yesterday against the district attorney in Durham, N.C., accusing him of ''systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion'' in the sexual assault case against three former members of the Duke University lacrosse team.  The bar complaint said the district attorney, Michael B. Nifong, had illegally withheld DNA evidence from defense lawyers and then intentionally misled the presiding judge and bar officials about doing so.  The new charges added to a previous ethics complaint accusing Mr. Nifong of making false and prejudicial remarks about the case to the news media. A three-member independent panel is expected to hear the matter against him this summer. Penalties could include disbarment.  Mr. Nifong's lawyer, David B. Freedman, denied yesterday that there had been ''any sort of intentional unethical conduct.'' In a telephone interview, Mr. Freedman said that Mr. Nifong had a ''flawless record'' for ethics in 28 years as a prosecutor and that a written response, to be issued within 30 days, would give his side of the case.  ''I have great confidence the panel will render a fair and just verdict,'' Mr. Freedman said.  The case against the former players is being reviewed by the state attorney general's office, which took it over from Mr. Nifong after he recused himself on Jan. 12. At the time, he said he faced a conflict of interest between prosecuting the case and defending himself against the first set of ethics charges, filed Dec. 28.  Much of the new ethics complaint focuses on Mr. Nifong's handling of private DNA testing and his remarks to a judge and bar officials about it. Those tests were arranged by Mr. Nifong after a state laboratory found no semen, blood or saliva from lacrosse players on or in the woman or on her clothes. Using a more sophisticated test, the private laboratory found DNA from multiple men on the woman and her underwear, but none from any of the lacrosse players.  Mr. Nifong and the lab director decided to tell defense lawyers only about the positive matches, including a link to the woman's boyfriend, in a summary report of the DNA work, said the bar, a state agency that regulates lawyers in North Carolina. The negative findings, which the bar said ''tended to negate the guilt of the accused,'' were included only in laboratory reports not given to defense lawyers for more than six months.  North Carolina law requires prosecutors to share all relevant information with defense lawyers promptly. Mr. Nifong told the judge in the case that he had turned over everything he had -- ''a misrepresentation and false statement of material fact made to a tribunal,'' the bar wrote. Mr. Nifong later objected to a defense request to turn over the full laboratory reports, citing cost and privacy concerns and terming the papers sought ''a witch hunt list,'' the bar said.  Mr. Nifong said in court on Dec. 15 that a defense motion two days earlier on the withheld DNA results was ''the first I heard of this particular situation.'' Later he said he had meant that it was the first he had heard of defense accusations that the results had been concealed, not that they existed. But the bar said the accusations themselves had not been raised until after Mr. Nifong spoke in court.  In an interview last month, Mr. Nifong agreed that the DNA results had been potentially exculpatory, but said they had not seemed important to him because he was no longer then pursuing the case on the basis of DNA evidence.

                    "text": "  Christmas presents came a few days late for the Fardan-Daniels children. On Dec. 28, Nadine Bosson, a social worker, took gifts to the Brooklyn shelter where the family was living.  ''Thank you, Miss Nadine!'' rang out from behind a flurry of Christmas paper.  Sayeedah Fardan, 15, got a book of Japanese Sudoku games and a paint set. She is a ninth grader at Legacy School for Integrated Studies. She wants to learn Japanese so that she can study in Japan someday.  Dawn Daniels, 10, unwrapped a chemistry set.  Darren Daniels III, 4, got a Learning Pad. His father, Darren Daniels II, 43, fiddled with the batteries. ''We are learning to read; it's a big thing for us,'' said his mother, Shebah Fardan, 35, referring to her son.  There was a remote-controlled car for Khalif Fardan, 17; a board game for Sashii Fardan, 13; Harry Potter books for Deloi Daniels, 11; and blocks for Daaimah Daniels, 8.  There were not many presents on Christmas Day, but Ms. Fardan said that it was filled with family time.  After being homeless for four years, the family was poised to move into an apartment as soon as the kitchen was finished.  At the shelter, the family has lived in two rooms that are not connected, each with a bathroom, kitchen space and bunk beds. The four youngest shared with their parents, and the older children slept in a room around the corner. Safety was a concern. They had to limit their children's movements after a certain hour, Ms. Fardan said.  The gift revelry was interrupted by room inspections. ''We never pass; it will be fine in the morning,'' Ms. Fardan said, and Sayeedah finished, ''and trashed by the afternoon.''  Lack of privacy in the shelter was continually wearing. But it was an improvement over a shelter in Auburn, N.Y., where the family lived for two years.  ''Nine of us in one room, and it was just a room,'' Mr. Daniels said. No kitchen, no bathroom, no sink.  With two working parents, and a rented house in Queens, the Fardan-Daniels family in 2001 never imagined that they would be homeless. Ms. Fardan worked freelance, building Web sites and also as a hairdresser. Mr. Daniels juggled jobs as a security guard and a forklift operator, among other things.  ''It was enough that the kids didn't need,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''We didn't go hungry; our bills were paid. We were able to live and not stress day to day.''  But in July of that year, a bicycle accident left him unable to work. ''It all stopped when I had the accident,'' he said. Little more than a year later, they entered the shelter system.  They have been trying to find a way out ever since. They need a five-bedroom that is wheelchair accessible. Daaimah was born with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. She sleeps in the top bunk in her parents' room. ''It's because it's got railings,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''She'll roll, and we don't want her to roll onto the floor.''  In June, Daaimah had surgery to repair a dislocated hip socket. The damage was caused in part, Ms. Fardan said, because she had outgrown her wheelchair. The surgery also released her Achilles' tendons, which had atrophied.  The family lives on Mr. Daniels's Social Security disability of $577 a month, and Daaimah's Supplemental Security Income of $574. They receive $555 in food stamps and $83 in public assistance. With the help of Ms. Bosson at New Alternatives for Children, a member agency of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, they were approved for the Housing Stability Plus program. It will cover all of the $1,676 monthly rent on their new apartment for the first year, and will subsidize a smaller percentage for the next five years.  A week before Christmas, $1,000 in Neediest Cases money was used for blankets, towels and sheets. Ms. Fardan also bought storage bins, in preparation for her move.  ''It's all about packing; that's all it is, right now,'' she said.  The family is looking forward to retrieving its belongings from storage. They are short two beds, one for Mr. Daniels and Ms. Fardan, and one for Darren, who was born in the shelter system. They will also need a dining room table and nine chairs.  Mr. Daniels and Ms. Fardan feel the stigma of homelessness keenly. ''Just because we're labeled homeless doesn't mean we're second-class citizens, and we shouldn't be labeled as such,'' Ms. Fardan said. ''We're not homeless,'' Mr. Daniels added. ''We're houseless,'' Ms. Fardan agreed.

The Olympus DS-50 voice recorder has a clip-on stereo microphone that will pick up both sides of a conversation.  The DS-50 is specifically designed for creating and listening to podcasts. It can record at CD quality (also known as a 44.1 kilohertz sampling rate) and connects to any PC with a U.S.B. cable. It can also play back MP3 and WMA files, allowing it to double as an audiobook reader and music player.  The recorder's microphone can clip to a tie or lapel, allowing the recorder to remain unobtrusive. Its one gigabyte of memory can hold around 275 hours of audio at average quality. Voice prompts describe current settings and audibly confirm commands.  The $249 DS-50 also has less expensive kin: the $150 DS-30 with 256 megabytes of memory, and the $200 DS-40 with 512 megabytes. All three will be available online and at retail stores this month.  While almost anything can record audio these days, only the DS-50 can do it while nestled discreetly in a pocket.

                    "text": "  North Carolina's attorney general said Saturday that his office would immediately assume control of the Duke lacrosse sexual assault case referred to him on Friday by the Durham County district attorney.  ''I wish I could tell you that this case would be resolved quickly,'' the attorney general, Roy A. Cooper, said at a news conference here on Saturday afternoon. ''Since we have not been involved in the investigation or the prosecution of these cases, all of the information will be new to our office. Any case with such serious criminal charges requires a careful and deliberate review.''  The district attorney, Michael B. Nifong, had asked Mr. Cooper to take over the prosecution, citing the conflict of interest he faced from having to respond to an ethics complaint from the North Carolina Bar Association. Mr. Nifong was ''very disappointed'' at giving up the case, his lawyer, David B. Freedman, said Saturday, but pleased with Mr. Cooper's assignment of two veteran prosecutors.  Defense lawyers and families of the defendants welcomed the news that the case would be in the hands of the attorney general's office.  ''We are taking a completely new, fresh look at this case, so anything could happen,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''We are looking at all the facts. Whatever charges, if any, are appropriate, they will be pursued.''  Mr. Cooper said his office would obtain the case files next week and then meet with defense lawyers and reinterview witnesses, including the accuser. He said he did not know if a pretrial hearing scheduled for Feb. 5 would have to be postponed.  Mr. Cooper, 49, a Democrat, is a former legislator who wrote a crime victim's bill of rights. He is serving his second term and has announced plans to run for re-election in 2008.  He assigned James J. Coman, head of the attorney general's Law Enforcement and Prosecutions Division, and Mary D. Winstead of the Special Prosecutions Division, to the case. But Mr. Cooper said he would make the final decisions in the case.  ''We accept the case with our eyes wide open to the evidence, but with blinders on for all other distractions,'' Mr. Cooper said.  From the start, the Duke case has been politically charged by race and class. A black woman hired to strip at a Duke lacrosse team party last March 13 accused three white students of gang rape. Protests erupted, and Mr. Nifong expressed with a certainty that a crime had occurred.  But in the last 10 months, his case floundered as defense lawyers offered time-stamped photographs challenging the stripper's account, prosecution reports highlighting the lack of DNA evidence and inconsistencies in the woman's story. Defense lawyers have insisted that the woman, 28, is a false accuser and have painted Mr. Nifong, 55, as a renegade with political motives.  Sexual offense and kidnapping charges are pending against Collin Finnerty, 20, of Garden City, N.Y.; Reade W. Seligmann, of Essex Fells, N.J.; and David F. Evans, 23, of Annapolis, Md. The three were initially charged with rape, but Mr. Nifong dismissed that charge after the accuser told an investigator she could not be sure what had penetrated her.  ",

                    "text": "  The Nets squandered double-digit leads in the fourth quarter and lost each of their first two games of their trip out West, a reflection of their inability to maintain a steady course this season.  The letdowns, 1-point defeats to the Sacramento Kings on Monday night and the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, came on the heels of a four-game winning streak that had the Nets at .500 for the first time in two months. They have followed each apparent turning point this season with a misstep.  With their season past the midway point, the Nets (20-22) were still trying for their first road victory against a Western Conference opponent when they played the Los Angeles Clippers (20-21) on Thursday night.  After the game against the Warriors, ''the mood was not good,'' Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said Thursday morning. ''If you're a competitor, as a player or as a coach, you're very upset about that, about losing two games like that, games that you had in hand.''  Perhaps most disheartening for the Nets is that their five-game trip was getting more difficult. They play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night and the Utah Jazz on Monday.  ''Virtually every game, we're playing a better team,'' Thorn said. ''We've got our work cut out for us.''  Against the Kings, the Nets held a 20-point lead in the third quarter, only to have it evaporate at the hands of Sacramento point guard Mike Bibby, who capped a strong fourth quarter by making the winning shot with 10 seconds remaining.  ''We just quit playing,'' Thorn said. ''We just stood around in the fourth quarter.''  The Nets led the Warriors by 11 points with a little more than four minutes remaining, but Golden State finished the game on a 17-5 run, capped by guard Monta Ellis hitting the winner at the buzzer. It was the seventh time this season the Nets had lost after squandering a double-digit lead.  ''It is hard,'' Nets forward Bostjan Nachbar said after the game. ''It is not easy. We had both games won. We thought we were the better team, at least most of the game. We lost the game down the stretch, and the next couple games will show how tough we are.''  The Nets' grit will have to start with their two stars, Jason Kidd and Vince Carter. That is especially true with their third top-flight player, Richard Jefferson, out for about six weeks after he had arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle Monday.  Kidd has been stellar all season, playing some of the best basketball of his career, but he had eight turnovers against the Warriors.  Carter, after leading by 214,000 votes the last time they were counted, was surpassed in the All-Star voting by the Washington Wizards' Gilbert Arenas for an Eastern Conference starting spot Thursday. Arenas beat out Carter by 3,010 votes, the smallest margin in 17 years. Carter has been voted a starter six times.  Before Thursday night's game, Carter pretended to have thought he had beaten out Arenas. After sarcastically acting as if his feelings were hurt, Carter said he would not be disappointed to go the game as a reserve.  ''It's still an honor to be involved in it,'' he said.  For now, Carter has more pressing things to think about. He scored only 8 points against the Kings. Despite having 23 points and a career-high 13 assists against the Warriors, he did not dominate down the stretch.  The injuries to Jefferson and center Nenad Krstic, who is out for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, have probably affected Carter more than any other player because he faces more double-teams.  As the Nets have struggled this season, Carter has seemed to be the most likely candidate for a trade if Thorn chooses to make drastic changes. Carter can opt out of his contract at the end of the season, meaning the Nets may try to get someone in return for him if they feel he may leave.  But with the Nets' recent success -- they had won 9 of 11 games before losing to the Kings and the Warriors -- much of the trade talk seemed to have settled.  The Nets' ability to make any significant trades by the Feb. 22 deadline could be hampered by the fact that two of their biggest assets, Jefferson and Krstic, are injured.  ''When you're talking about trading, you trade from assets,'' Thorn said. ''If you don't have a lot of assets to trade, it's difficult to make anything but a minor trade.''  BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Donald E. Osterbrock, an astronomer and historian of science who studied the birth of stars and luminous clouds of gas at the core of galaxies outside the Milky Way and wrote an influential textbook about the subject, died on Jan. 11 in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 82.  The cause was a heart attack, his family said.  Dr. Osterbrock, a former director of Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton in California, was interested in clusters of stars and dust within clouds of gas that emit a telltale glow and are collectively known as gaseous nebulae.  In his textbook for graduate students, ''Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei'' (1989), he explained the phenomenon and also described events going on at the center of external galaxies. The book includes descriptions of quasars, the distant and massive black holes whose brightness can sometimes be detected through optical telescopes from Earth. In 2006, the text was published in a revised edition with another astronomer, Gary J. Ferland.  In the early 1950s, while still a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Dr. Osterbrock helped determine the spiral shape of the Milky Way in observations at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin. Working with William W. Morgan and others, he used a wide-angle camera to detect clouds of glowing hydrogen gas and trace the spiraling arms of the galaxy. The landmark discovery was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in 1951.  Late in his career, Dr. Osterbrock augmented his research with historical studies and intellectual biographies of prominent astronomers of the 19th and 20th centuries. He wrote profiles of James E. Keeler and Walter Baade as well as a book-length study, ''Pauper and Prince: Ritchey, Hale and Big American Telescopes'' (1993).  Donald Edward Osterbrock was born in Cincinnati on July 13, 1924. He earned his doctorate in astronomy from the University of Chicago in 1952.  After teaching briefly at Princeton and the California Institute of Technology, he joined the University of Wisconsin as an assistant professor of astronomy in 1958. Dr. Osterbrock was named a professor of astronomy at Wisconsin in 1961 and remained until 1973.  He was director of Lick Observatory from 1973 to 1981, and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, from 1973 to 1992. He became a professor emeritus there in 1993.  He served as president of the American Astronomical Society from 1988 to 1990. The Royal Astronomical Society awarded him a gold medal in 1997.  Dr. Osterbrock is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Irene Hansen. The couple lived in Santa Cruz.  He is also survived by a son, William, of Santa Cruz; two daughters, Laura of Seattle and Carol LePage of Santa Cruz; and three grandchildren.  ",

                    "text": "  A family of five -- two adults and three children -- was found slain in its house in a working-class section of Dutchess County early Friday after firefighters responded to a blaze that gutted the home, the authorities said.  It was unclear Friday night how the family had been killed, or where the bodies were found in the house. A Fishkill police official at the scene said there had been reports of gunfire before the fire broke out, but he would not elaborate. ''It's definitely being investigated as a homicide,'' said the official, who would not give his name.  Maj. William Carey of the state police told The Associated Press that the fire was set ''to cover the killing'' of the family. ''We're just starting the investigation at this point,'' Major Carey said.  Other officials said the youngest child had been bludgeoned and the middle child stabbed.  The state police identified the victims Friday night as Manuel Morey, 33, known as Tony; his wife, Tina, 30; and their three sons: Manuel, 13, also known as Tony; Ryan, 6; and Adam, 10.  The quiet town of Fishkill, about 60 miles north of New York City, was flooded with reporters, photographers and television news trucks. Police officials said homicides were rare in the community. ''This has got to be the biggest thing that's happened in all my years here,'' said a police sergeant, Thomas G. Hurley.  Neighbors said the Moreys moved into a rented rundown Cape-style home on Route 82, a busy two-lane highway, a year ago. Most neighbors said they knew the family members mostly for their raucous summer barbecues and their fondness for riding noisy all-terrain vehicles late at night. The house has a dirt yard, and a woodsy plot in back abuts a 20-foot-wide stream.  Police officers at the scene said the bodies were taken to the Dutchess County medical examiner's office for autopsies.  The fire, which was reported around 3:15 a.m., gutted the house and collapsed part of the roof. It required at least six fire departments to extinguish, and investigators were sifting through evidence late into the night.  Police officials said they were investigating, in connection with the house fire, a car fire that occurred simultaneously half a mile east on Route 82. They would not specify the connection.  Neighbors described the Morey sons as rough-and-tumble kids who liked to help their father fix their all-terrain vehicles, and played in the woods in the back of the house. Manuel was in the seventh grade at Van Wyck Junior High School in Wappingers Falls, where he played on the football team. The other sons attended elementary school.  Neighbors said the elder Manuel and Tina Morey grew up in the area. One neighbor, Cheryl Bianchini, said Mr. Morey irritated the neighbors by riding his A.T.V. ''up and down the block at all hours of the night.''  ''It was really loud and annoying, and the police were called on him a few times, but he kept doing it,'' she said.  A police sergeant said he could not verify that claim on Friday.  ''The family had problems, troubles,'' said Ms. Bianchini, whose daughter Alyssa attended Brinckerhoff Elementary School with Adam.  The owner of the house, Tom Skaarva, 43, who lives a few houses down, said Mr. Morey worked installing fences for a local company and began renting the house last February. Ms. Morey always brought over the rent money, $1,350 in cash, on time each month, but he said they had not paid the rent since Nov. 1, so he had begun eviction proceedings.  ''The wife appeared in court, but Tony never showed,'' Mr. Skaarva said. ''We had not seen him around for a while. I don't know if he moved out or what.''  Mr. Skaarva said he rented to Mr. Morey without checking his background and soon came to regret it.  ''He tore up that lawn with his A.T.V.,'' Mr. Skaarva said. In the summer, he installed a wooden stockade fence and began having raucous barbecues every weekend, he said.  He said Mr. Morey always wore a white T-shirt and leather jacket and jeans. ''He'd never look you in the eye,'' he said. ''He would just keep staring at the ground and pacing.''  ",

''Heroes'' did remain the night's highest-rated show in the 18 to 49 demographic, ahead of second-place ''24.'' For the night, NBC outdrew Fox by a half million total viewers. Its game show at 8, ''Deal or No Deal,'' claimed the title of most-watched show on Monday (16.9 million), but the 10 o'clock hour remained NBC's weakest, as ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' attracted 7 million viewers opposite a repeat of CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (13.4 million). CBS broadcast reruns of its comedy lineup from 8 to 10 and finished third over all. ABC was fourth, despite new episodes of ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.7 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (5.7 million).  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

But museums only recently caught on to the idea that needlework can also make good artwork.

Take whatever ideas you can glean from it to the next meeting of one of New York's Stitch 'n Bitch circles, and get your own radical craft on.

The event started in 2004 as a world-music showcase for concert bookers gathered at the annual conference of the Association of Performing Arts Promoters, and it has outgrown its initial home at the Public Theater. This year it moves to Webster Hall, so there's room for a general audience. A dozen acts are in the lineup, each offering a different perspective on how the traditional meets the present. LENINE, one of Brazil's most beloved songwriters, will play an acoustic set that's likely to merge the maracatu rhythms of Recife with his own gift for melody. SARA TAVARES draws on the Afro-Portuguese rhythms of the Cape Verde Islands, while ANDY PALACIO AND THE GARIFUNA COLLECTIVE play African-rooted music from Central America. LILA DOWNS carries the husky drama of Mexican tradition into songs addressed to both sides of the border. And Lucia Pulido, a Colombian singer based in New York, leads PALENQUE, which weaves jazzy accompaniments around traditional songs.  DENGUE FEVER is a Los Angeles band with a Cambodian lead singer and a taste for 1960s psychedelic rock from both California and Asia. BOOM PAN, an Israeli trio of guitar, tuba and percussion, delivers modal melodies with the twangy reverb of surf guitar. JULIA SARR, a singer from Senegal, and PATRICE LAROSE, a guitarist from France, mingle African vamps, French pop and a touch of flamenco.  A French contingent also includes the peppy BABYLON CIRCUS, which connects the horns and oompah of ska to accordion-driven cabaret, big-band swing and some political thoughts; LES PRIMITIFS DU FUTUR, playing jazzy songs that echo the 1920s and 1930s; and LE TRIO JOUBRAN, Palestinian brothers who adapt Middle Eastern classical pieces for the oud. American tradition is also on the bill with the CAROLINA CHOCOLATE DROPS, a string band revitalizing the African-American roots of old-timey music from the Piedmont. Sunday night at 6, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $40.  ",

                    "text": "  In a devastating condemnation of Consolidated Edison, state regulators have concluded that a failure to adequately maintain, operate and oversee its electrical network was ''the overriding cause'' of the nine-day blackout that paralyzed western Queens last July.  The regulators estimated that 174,000 people lost power in the blackout -- 70,000 more than was previously known. For the first three days of the blackout, Con Edison had insisted that no more than 8,000 people were affected.  In a 185-page draft report posted on its Web site last night, the staff of the New York State Public Service Commission concluded that the company had ''failed to fulfill its responsibilities'' under state law and recommended a formal proceeding that could result in large financial penalties against Con Edison.  The withering assessment and the prospect of hefty fines are all but certain to renew calls for the ouster of Con Edison's chairman and chief executive, Kevin M. Burke, who was widely blamed for failing to discern the magnitude of the blackout, which lasted from July 17 to 25, until three days after it started.  In its relentlessly critical language, the report sharply contradicts Con Edison's own 600-page report, released Oct. 12, which attributed the blackout to a series of events beyond its control, notably an underground fire, malfunctions in an electric breaker and a sudden surge of current.  The state report concludes instead that the primary cause of the blackout was ''the company's failure to address a multitude of pre-existing problems and issues associated with the operations, maintenance and oversight of the Long Island City network,'' which supplies power to about 460,000 people in western Queens.  The report suggests that the blackout lasted as long as it did because of Con Edison's ''failure to shut the network down in light of glaring evidence that the secondary system was experiencing severe damage'' in the early part of the blackout.  On the night of July 18, the second day of the event, top Con Edison managers contemplated shutting down the entire network, which would have caused an even wider blackout but would have caused less damage and been easier and faster to recover from.  Mr. Burke and other executives have since defended their decision not to shut down the network -- a decision that the new report suggests was a grave mistake.  Even as Con Edison's rank-and-file workers ''worked hard to contain the crisis,'' according to the report, ''the company's senior management failed or refused to comprehend the magnitude of the damage to its secondary system and the subsequent impact on customers.''  In a statement last night, a Con Edison spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin, said a controlled shutdown would have ''affected the lives of more than one million people, with no guarantee that power would have been restored any sooner.'' He added, ''We believed then, and still believe, that that would have been a worse situation.''  Mr. Clendenin said the utility was reviewing the report and ''will implement any actions necessary to reduce the likelihood of similar occurrences in the future.''  An analysis by The New York Times last summer, based on Con Edison documents, found that the Long Island City network had the most feeder-cable failures in 2004 and 2005 of any of the 57 networks. The analysis also found that several failures involved components that were 30 to 60 years old.  Con Edison said in response that the network was fine and among the top one-fourth of all underground networks in performance.  The new report rejected that argument. It stated that many of the network's components ''were not in conformance with the company's operating specifications.''  It added that Con Edison failed to understand the effects of load growth and transformer additions on the network. ''The size and complexity of the network,'' it said, ''outpaced the sophistication of the company's primary planning and contingency analysis tools.''  The report also found that that the utility's performance was ''particularly unacceptable'' when it came to communicating with the public.  Con Edison never gave a precise estimate of the number of people affected in the blackout. Its final rough guess was 25,000 customers -- a term that includes residential buildings and businesses and was said to translate to roughly 100,000 people. The new report found that the blackout affected 65,000 customers, or about 174,000 people.  The lack of a reliable estimate delayed Con Edison's response to the blackout and the arrival of emergency resources, according to the report, which called the absence of a system to properly assess damages and outages ''a major failing.''  Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat whose district included much of the area affected by the blackout, said the new report vindicated the utility's critics. ''Clearly, the fiction that Con Edison's decisions were correct has been exposed,'' he said.  Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat and the chairman of a committee that oversees the Public Service Commission, said the draft report should be accompanied by financial penalties. ''There's a lot of criticism, but no action,'' he said. ''That's not good enough.''  The commission's chairman at the time of the blackout, William M. Flynn, ordered the investigation on July 26, a day after the blackout ended. The commission held five days of hearings from August to November.  The staff originally intended to issue the draft report by Dec. 31. Con Edison and others may comment by Jan. 31. Then the commission will approve a final version.  In a related action, the commission yesterday approved the hiring of a consultant, Vantage Consulting of Cudjoe Key, Fla., to conduct an independent audit of Con Edison's electric emergency response program. Con Edison is to cover the cost of the work, which is not to exceed $800,800.  The commission ordered the audit in September and received seven proposals from consultants in November, before selecting Vantage.  ",

                    "text": "  Sometimes I feel that living in New York City, having a good family and friends, and just being alive is a dream, that perhaps this second life of mine isn't really happening. Whenever I speak at the United Nations, Unicef or elsewhere to raise awareness of the continual and rampant recruitment of children in wars around the world, I come to realize that I still do not fully understand how I could have possibly survived the civil war in my country, Sierra Leone.  Most of my friends, after meeting the woman whom I think of as my new mother, a Brooklyn-born white Jewish-American, assume that I was either adopted at a very young age or that my mother married an African man. They would never imagine that I was 17 when I came to live with her and that I had been a child soldier and participated in one of the most brutal wars in recent history.  In early 1993, when I was 12, I was separated from my family as the Sierra Leone civil war, which began two years earlier, came into my life. The rebel army, known as the Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F.), attacked my town in the southern part of the country. I ran away, along paths and roads that were littered with dead bodies, some mutilated in ways so horrible that looking at them left a permanent scar on my memory. I ran for days, weeks and months, and I couldn't believe that the simple and precious world I had known, where nights were celebrated with storytelling and dancing and mornings greeted with the singing of birds and cock crows, was now a place where only guns spoke and sometimes it seemed even the sun hesitated to shine. After I discovered that my parents and two brothers had been killed, I felt even more lost and worthless in a world that had become pregnant with fear and suspicion as neighbor turned against neighbor and child against parent. Surviving each passing minute was nothing short of a miracle.  After almost a year of running, I, along with some friends I met along the way, arrived at an army base in the southeastern region. We thought we were now safe; little did we know what lay ahead.  1994: The First Battle  I have never been so afraid to go anywhere in my life as I was that first day. As we walked into the arms of the forest, tears began to form in my eyes, but I struggled to hide them and gripped my gun for comfort. We exhaled quietly, afraid that our own breathing could cause our deaths. The lieutenant led the line that I was in. He raised his fist in the air, and we stopped moving. Then he slowly brought it down, and we sat on one heel, our eyes surveying the forest. We began to move swiftly among the bushes until we came to the edge of a swamp, where we formed an ambush, aiming our guns into the bog. We lay flat on our stomachs and waited. I was lying next to my friend Josiah. At 11, he was even younger than I was. Musa, a friend my age, 13, was also nearby. I looked around to see if I could catch their eyes, but they were concentrating on the invisible target in the swamp. The tops of my eyes began to ache, and the pain slowly rose up to my head. My ears became warm, and tears were running down my cheeks, even though I wasn't crying. The veins on my arms stood out, and I could feel them pulsating as if they had begun to breathe of their own accord. We waited in the quiet, as hunters do. The silence tormented me.  The short trees in the swamp began to shake as the rebels made their way through them. They weren't yet visible, but the lieutenant had passed the word down through a whisper that was relayed like a row of falling dominos: ''Fire on my command.'' As we watched, a group of men dressed in civilian clothes emerged from under the tiny bushes. They waved their hands, and more fighters came out. Some were boys, as young as we were. They sat together in line, waving their hands, discussing a strategy. My lieutenant ordered a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) to be fired, but the commander of the rebels heard it as it whooshed its way out of the forest. ''Retreat!'' he called out to his men, and the grenade's blast got only a few rebels, whose split bodies flew in the air. The explosion was followed by an exchange of gunfire from both sides.  I lay there with my gun pointed in front of me, unable to shoot. My index finger became numb. I felt as if the forest had turned upside down and I was going to fall off, so I clutched the base of a tree with one hand. I couldn't think, but I could hear the sounds of the guns far away in the distance and the cries of people dying in pain. A splash of blood hit my face. In my reverie I had opened my mouth a bit, so I tasted some of the blood. As I spat it out and wiped it off my face, I saw the soldier it had come from. Blood poured out of the bullet holes in him like water rushing through newly opened tributaries. His eyes were wide open; he still held his gun. My eyes were fixed on him when I heard Josiah screaming for his mother in the most painfully piercing voice I had ever heard. It vibrated inside my head to the point that I felt my brain had shaken loose from its anchor.  I searched for Josiah. An RPG had tossed his tiny body off the ground, and he had landed on a tree stump. He wiggled his legs as his cry gradually came to an end. There was blood everywhere. It seemed as if bullets were falling into the forest from all angles. I crawled to Josiah and looked into his eyes. There were tears in them, and his lips were shaking, but he couldn't speak. As I watched him, the water in his eyes was replaced with blood that quickly turned his brown eyes red. He reached for my shoulder as if to pull himself up. But midway, he stopped moving. The gunshots faded in my head, and it was as if my heart had stopped and the whole world had come to a standstill. I covered his eyes with my fingers and lifted him from the tree stump. His backbone had been shattered. I placed him flat on the ground and picked up my gun. I didn't realize that I had stood up to take Josiah off the tree stump. I felt someone tugging at my foot. It was the corporal; he was saying something that I couldn't understand. His mouth moved, and he looked terrified. He pulled me down, and as I hit the ground, I felt my brain shaking in my skull again, and my deafness gave way.  ''Get down,'' he was screaming. ''Shoot,'' he said, as he crawled away from me to resume his position. As I looked to where he lay, my eyes caught Musa, whose head was covered with blood. His hands looked too relaxed. I turned toward the swamp, where there were gunmen running, trying to cross over. My face, my hands, my shirt and my gun were drenched in blood. I raised my gun and pulled the trigger, and I killed a man. Suddenly all the death I had seen since the day I was touched by war began flashing in my head. Every time I stopped shooting to change magazines and saw my two lifeless friends, I angrily pointed my gun into the swamp and killed more people. I shot everything that moved, until we were ordered to retreat because we needed another plan.  We took the guns and ammunition off the bodies of my friends and left them there in the forest, which had taken on a life of its own, as if it had trapped the souls that had departed from the dead. The branches of the trees seemed to be holding hands and bowing their heads in prayer. In the swamp, crabs had already begun feasting on the eyes of the dead. Limbs and fragmented skulls lay on top of the bog, and the water in the swamp was stagnant with blood. I was not afraid of these lifeless bodies. I despised them and kicked them to flip them and take their guns. I found a G3 and some ammunition. I noticed that most of the dead gunmen and boys wore lots of jewelry on their necks and wrists.  We arrived in the village, our base, with nightfall and sat against the walls of houses. It was quiet, and perhaps afraid of the silence, we began cleaning the blood off our guns, oiling their chambers, and shooting them into the air to test their effectiveness. I went for supper that night but was unable to eat. I only drank water and felt nothing. I lay on my back in the tent with my AK-47 on my chest and the G3 I had taken from a dead rebel leaning on the peg of the tent. Nothing happened in my head. It was a void, and I stared at the roof of the tent until I was miraculously able to doze off. I had a dream that I was picking up Josiah from the tree stump and a gunman stood on top of me. He placed his gun against my forehead. I immediately woke up from my dream and began shooting inside the tent, until the 30 rounds in the magazine were finished. The corporal and the lieutenant came in afterward and took me outside. I was sweating, and they threw water on my face and gave me a few white capsules. They were the same capsules that we'd all been given before we had gone into battle, and to this day, I do not know what they contained. I stayed up all night and couldn't sleep for days. We went out two more times that week, and I had no problem shooting my gun.  Rebel Raids  After that first week of going out on raids to kill people we deemed our rebel enemies or sympathizers of the rebels, our initiation was complete. We stayed put at the base, and we boys took turns guarding posts around the village. We smoked marijuana and sniffed ''brown brown,'' cocaine mixed with gunpowder, which was always spread out on a table near the ammunition hut, and of course I took more of the white capsules, as I had become addicted to them. The first time I took all these drugs at the same time, I began to perspire so much that I took off all my clothes. My body shook, my sight became blurred and I lost my hearing for several minutes. I walked around the village restlessly. But after several doses of these drugs, all I felt was numbness to everything and so much energy that I couldn't sleep for weeks. We watched war movies at night, Rambo ''First Blood,'' ''Rambo, First Blood, Part II,'' ''Commando'' and so on, with the aid of a generator or a car battery. We all wanted to be like Rambo; we couldn't wait to implement his techniques.  When we ran out of supplies, we raided rebel camps in towns, villages and forests. ''We have good news from our informants'' the lieutenant would announce. ''We are moving out in five minutes to kill some rebels and take their supplies, which really belong to us.'' He often made speeches about how we were defending our country, how honorable we were. At these times, I would stand holding my gun and feeling special because I was part of something that took me seriously and I was not running from anyone anymore. The lieutenant's face evinced confidence; his smiles disappeared before they were completed. We would tie our heads with the green cloths that distinguished us from the rebels, and we boys would lead the way. There were no maps and no questions asked. We were simply told to follow the path until we received instructions on what to do next. We walked for long hours and stopped only to eat sardines and corned beef with gari, sniff brown brown and take more white capsules. The combination of these drugs made us fierce. The idea of death didn't cross my mind, and killing had become as easy as drinking water. After that first killing, my mind had stopped making remorseful records, or so it seemed.  Before we got to a rebel camp, we would deviate from the path and walk in the forest. Once the camp was in sight, we would surround it and wait for the lieutenant's command. The rebels roamed about; some sat against walls, dozing off, and others, boys as young as we, stood at guard posts passing around marijuana. Whenever I looked at rebels during raids, my entire body shook with fury; they were the people who had shot my friends and family. So when the lieutenant gave orders, I shot as many as I could, but I didn't feel better. After every gunfight, we would enter the rebel camp, killing those we had wounded. We would then search the houses and gather gallons of gasoline, enormous amounts of marijuana and cocaine, bales of clothes, watches, rice, salt, gari and many other things. We rounded up any civilians -- men, women, boys and young girls -- hiding in the huts and houses and made them carry our loot back to the base. We shot them if they tried to run away.  On one of these raids, we captured a few rebels after a long gunfight and a lot of civilian casualties. We undressed the prisoners and tied their arms behind their backs until their chests were tight as drums. ''Where did you get all this ammunition from?'' the corporal asked one of the prisoners, a man with an almost dreadlocked beard. He spat in the corporal's face, and the corporal immediately shot him in the head at close range. He fell to the ground, and blood slowly leaked out of his head. We cheered in admiration of the corporal's action and saluted him as he walked by. Suddenly, a rebel hiding in the bushes shot one of our boys. We dispersed around the village in search of the shooter. When the young muscular rebel was captured, the lieutenant slit his neck with his bayonet. The rebel ran before he fell to the ground and stopped moving. We cheered again, raising our guns in the air, shouting and whistling.  During that time, a lot of things were done with no reason or explanation. Sometimes we were asked to leave for war in the middle of a movie. We would come back hours later after killing many people and continue the movie as if we had just returned from intermission. We were always either on the front lines, watching a war movie or doing drugs. There was no time to be alone or to think. When we conversed with one another, we talked only about the movies and how impressed we were with the way either the lieutenant, the corporal or one of us had killed someone. It was as if nothing else existed.  The villages that we captured and turned into our bases as we went along and the forests that we slept in became my home. My squad was my family, my gun was my provider and protector and my rule was to kill or be killed. The extent of my thoughts didn't go much beyond that. We had been fighting for more than two years, and killing had become a daily activity. I felt no pity for anyone. My childhood had gone by without my knowing, and it seemed as if my heart had frozen. I knew that day and night came and went because of the presence of the moon and the sun, but I had no idea whether it was a Sunday or a Friday.  Taken From the Front  In my head my life was normal. But everything began to change in January 1996. I was 15.  One morning that month, a truck came to the village where we were based. Four men dressed in clean blue jeans and white T-shirts that said ''Unicef'' in big blue letters jumped out. They were shown to the lieutenant's house. It seemed as if he had been expecting them. As they sat talking on the veranda, we watched them from under the mango tree, where we sat cleaning our guns. Soon all the boys were told to line up for the lieutenant who selected a few of us and asked the adult soldiers to take away our guns and ammunition. A bunch of boys, including my friend Alhaji and me, were ushered to the truck. I stared back at the veranda where the lieutenant now stood, looking in the other direction, toward the forest, his hands crossed behind his back. I still didn't know exactly what was going on, but I was beginning to get angry and anxious. Why had the lieutenant decided to give us up to these civilians? We thought that we were part of the war until the end.  We were on the road for hours. I had gotten used to always moving and hadn't sat in one place idly for a long time. It was night when the truck stopped at a center, where there were other boys whose appearances, red eyes and somber faces resembled ours. Alhaji and I looked at this group, and he asked the boys who they were. A boy who was sitting on the stoop angrily said: ''We fought for the R.U.F.; the army is the enemy. We fought for freedom, and the army killed my family and destroyed my village. I will kill any of those army bastards every time I get a chance to do so.'' The boy took off his shirt to fight, and on his arm was the R.U.F. brand. Mambu, one of the boys on our side, shouted, ''They are rebels,'' and reached for his bayonet, which he had hidden in his army shorts; most of us had hidden either a knife or a grenade before our guns were taken from us. Before Mambu could grab his weapon, the R.U.F. boy punched him in the face. He fell, and when he got up, his nose was bleeding. The rebel boys drew out the few bayonets they had in their shorts and rushed toward us. It was war all over again. Perhaps the na\u00efve men who had taken us to the center thought that removing us from the war would lessen our hatred for the R.U.F. It hadn't crossed their minds that a change of environment wouldn't immediately make us normal boys; we were dangerous, brainwashed to kill.  One boy grabbed my neck from behind. He was squeezing for the kill, and I couldn't use my bayonet effectively, so I elbowed him with all my might until he let go. He was holding his stomach when I turned around and stabbed him in his foot. The bayonet stuck, so I pulled it out with force. He fell, and I began kicking him in the face. As I went to deliver the final blow with my bayonet, someone came from behind me and sliced my hand with his knife. It was a rebel boy, and he was about to kick me down when he fell on his face. Alhaji had stabbed him in the back. He pulled the knife out, and we started kicking the boy until he stopped moving. I wasn't sure whether he was unconscious or dead. I didn't care. No one screamed or cried during the fight. After all, we had been doing such things for years and were all still on drugs.  We continued to stab and slice one another until a bunch of MPs came running through the gate toward the fight. The MPs fired a few rounds into the air to get us to stop, but we were still fighting, so they had to part us by force. They placed some of us at gunpoint and kicked others apart. Six people were killed: two on our side and four on the rebel side.  As MPs stood guard to make sure we didn't start another fight, we, the army boys, went to the kitchen to look for food. We ate and chatted about the fight. Mambu told us that he had plucked an eye out of the head of one of the R.U.F. boys, and that the boy ran to punch him, but he couldn't see, so he ran into the wall, banging his head hard and fainting. We laughed and picked up Mambu, raising him in the air. We needed the violence to cheer us after a whole day of boring travel and contemplation about why our superiors had let us go.  That night we were moved to a rehabilitation center called Benin Home. Benin Home was run by a local NGO called Children Associated With the War, in Kissy neighborhood, on the eastern outskirts of Freetown, the capital. This time, the MPs made sure to search us thoroughly before we entered. The blood of our victims and enemies was fresh on our arms and clothes. My lieutenant's words still echoed in my head: ''From now on, we kill any rebel we see, no prisoners.'' I smiled a bit, happy that we had taken care of the rebel boys, but I also began to wonder again: Why had we been taken here? I walked up and down on the veranda, restless in my new environment. My head began to hurt.  Relearning Boyhood  It was infuriating to be told what to do by civilians. Their voices, even when they called us for breakfast, enraged me so much that I would punch the wall, my locker or anything nearby. A few days earlier, we could have decided whether they would live or die.  We refused to do anything that we were asked to do, except eat. At the end of every meal, the staff members and nurses came to talk to us about attending the scheduled medical checkups and the one-on-one counseling sessions that we hated at the minihospital that was part of Benin Home. As soon as the live-in staff, mostly men, started telling us what to do, we would throw bowls, spoons, food and benches at them. We would chase them out of the dining hall and beat them. One afternoon, after we had chased off several staff members, we placed a bucket over the cook's head and pushed him around the kitchen until he burned his hand on a boiling pot and agreed to put more milk in our tea. During that same week, the drugs were wearing off. I craved cocaine and marijuana so badly that I would roll a plain sheet of paper and smoke it. Sometimes I searched the pockets of my army shorts, which I still wore, for crumbs of marijuana or cocaine. We broke into the minihospital and stole some painkillers -- white tablets and off-white -- and red and yellow capsules. We emptied the capsules, ground the tablets and mixed them together. But the mixture didn't give us the effect we wanted. We got more upset day by day and, as a result, resorted to more violence. We began to fight one another day and night. We would fight for hours for no reason at all. At first the staff would intervene, but after a while they just let us go. They couldn't really stop us, and perhaps they thought that we would get this out of our systems. During these fights, we destroyed most of the furniture and threw the mattresses out in the yard. We would stop to wipe the blood off our lips, arms and legs only when the bell rang for mealtime.  It had been more than a month, and some of us had almost gone through the withdrawal stage, even though there were still instances of vomiting and collapsing at unexpected moments. These outbreaks ended, for most of us, at the end of the second month. But we now had time to think; the fastened mantle of our war memories slowly began to open. We resorted to more violence to avoid summoning thoughts of our recent lives.  Whenever I turned on the faucet, all I could see was blood gushing out. I would stare at it until it looked like water before drinking or taking a shower. Boys sometimes ran out of the hall screaming, ''The rebels are coming.'' Other times, the younger ones sat weeping and telling us that nearby rocks were their dead families.  It took several months before I began to relearn how to sleep without the aid of medicine. But even when I was finally able to fall asleep, I would start awake less than an hour later. I would dream that a faceless gunman had tied me up and begun to slit my throat with the zigzag edge of his bayonet. I would feel the pain that the knife inflicted as the man sawed my neck. I'd wake up sweating and throwing punches in the air. I would run outside to the middle of the soccer field, sit on a stone and rock back and forth, my arms wrapped around my legs. I would try desperately to think about my childhood, but I couldn't. The fighting memories seemed to have formed a barrier that I had to break in order to think about any moment before the war. On those mornings, I would feel one of the staff members wrap a blanket around me, saying: ''This isn't your fault, you know. It really isn't. You'll get through this.'' He would then pull me up and walk me back to the hall.  Past and Present  One day after I'd been in Benin Home for more than three months, I was sent to the minihospital for a checkup. The nurse on duty was named Esther. I had met her once before when I was sent to the minihospital after cutting my hand punching a window. Esther wore a white uniform and a white hat. Her white teeth contrasted with her dark, shiny skin, and when she smiled, her face glowed. She was tall and had big brown eyes that were kind and inviting. She must have been about 30, which I thought was too old.  That day, before Esther examined me, she gave me a present, a Walkman and a Run-DMC tape. I used to listen to rap music a lot before the war and loved it because of its poetic use of words. I put the headphones on and didn't mind being examined because the song had taken hold of me, and I listened closely to every word. But when she began examining my legs and saw the nasty scars on my left shin, she took my headphones off and asked, ''How did you get these scars?''  ''Bullet wounds,'' I casually replied.  Her face filled with sorrow, and her voice was shaking when she spoke: ''You have to tell me what happened so I can prescribe treatment.'' At first I was reluctant, but she said she would be able to treat me effectively only if I told her what happened, especially about how my bullet wounds were treated. So I told her the whole story not because I really wanted to but because I thought that if I told her some of the truth of my war years, she would be afraid of me and would cease asking questions. She listened attentively when I began to talk:  During the second dry season of my war years, we were low on food and ammunition. So as usual, we decided to attack another village, which was a three-day walk away. We left our base that evening, stopping once a day to eat, drink and take drugs. Each of us had two guns, one strapped to our backs, the other held in our hands. On the evening of the third day, the village was in sight.  Surrounding it, we waited for the lieutenant's command. As we lay in ambush, we began to realize that the place was empty. We were beginning to suspect that something was amiss when a shot was fired from behind us. It was clear now: we were being ambushed. We ended up in a fight that lasted more than 24 hours. We lost several men and boys. When we finally seemed to have captured the village, we began to look around for anything we could find. I was filling my backpack with ammunition from a hut when bullets began to rain on the village again. I was hit three times in my left shin. The first two bullets went in and out, and the last one stayed inside. I couldn't walk, so I lay on the ground and released an entire round of the magazine into the bush where the bullets had come from. I remember feeling a tingle in my spine, but I was too drugged to really feel the pain, even though my leg had begun to swell. The sergeant doctor in my squad dragged me into one of the houses and tried to remove the bullet. Each time he raised his hands from my wound, I saw my blood all over his fingers. My eyes began to grow heavy, and I fainted.  I do not know what happened, but when I woke the next day, I felt as if I had nails hammered into the bones of my shin and my veins were being chiseled. I felt so much pain that I was unable to cry out loud; tears just fell from my eyes. The ceiling of the thatched-roof house where I was lying on a bed was blurry. My eyes struggled to become familiar with my surroundings. The gunfire had ceased and the village was quiet, so I assumed that the attackers had been successfully driven away. I felt a brief relief for that, but the pain in my leg returned. I tucked my lips in, closed my heavy eyelids and held tight to the edges of the wooden bed. I heard the footsteps of people entering the house. They stood by my bed, and as soon as they began to speak, I recognized their voices.  ''The boy is suffering, and we have no medicine here to lessen his pain. Everything is at our former base.'' The sergeant doctor sighed and continued. ''It will take six days to send someone to get the medicine and return. He will die from the pain by then.''  ''We have to send him to the former base, then,'' I heard my lieutenant saying. ''We need those provisions from that base, anyway. Do all you can to make sure that the boy stays alive,'' he said and walked out. ''Yes, sir,'' the sergeant doctor said. I slowly opened my eyes, and this time I could see clearly. I looked at his sweaty face and tried to smile a little. After having heard what they said, I swore to myself that I would fight hard and do anything for my squad after my leg was healed.  ''We will get you some help,'' the sergeant doctor said gently, sitting by my bed and examining my leg. ''Just be strong, young man,''  ''Yes, sir,'' I said, and tried to raise my hand to salute him, but he tenderly brought my arm down.  Two soldiers came into the house, took me off the bed, placed me in a hammock and carried me outside. The treetops of the village began to spin around as they carried me out. The journey felt as if it took a month. I fainted and awoke many times, and each time I opened my eyes, it seemed as if the voices of those who carried me were fading into the distance.  Finally we got to the base, and the sergeant doctor, who had come along, went to work on me. I was injected with something. I was given cocaine, which I frantically demanded. The doctor started operating on me before the drugs took effect. The other soldiers held my hands and stuffed a cloth into my mouth. The doctor stuck a crooked-looking scissorslike tool inside my wound and fished for the bullet. I could feel the edge of the metal inside me. My entire body was racked with pain.  Just when I thought I had had enough, the doctor abruptly pulled the bullet out. A piercing pain rushed up my spine from my waist to the back of my neck. I fainted.  When I regained consciousness, it was the morning of the next day, and the drugs had kicked in. I reached my hands down to my leg and felt the bandage before I stood up and limped outside, where some soldiers and the sergeant were sitting. ''Where is my weapon?'' I asked them. The sergeant handed me my G3, and I began cleaning it. I shot a couple of rounds sitting against a wall, ignoring the bandage on my leg and everyone else. I smoked marijuana, ate and snorted cocaine and brown brown. That was all I did for a few days before we went back to the new base we had captured. When we left, we threw kerosene on the thatched-roof houses, lighted them with matches and fired a couple of RPGs into the walls. We always destroyed the bases we abandoned so that rebel squads wouldn't be able to use them. Two soldiers carried me in the hammock, but this time I had my gun, and I looked left and right as we traveled the forest path.  At the new base, I stayed put for three weeks. Then one day, we heard that a rebel group was on its way to attack our village. I tightened the bandage around my shin, picked up my gun and followed my squad to ambush them. We killed most of the attackers and captured a few whom we brought back to base. ''These are the men responsible for the bullet holes in your leg. It's time to make sure they never shoot at you or your comrades.'' The lieutenant pointed at the prisoners. I was not sure if one of the captives was the shooter, but any captive would do at that time. They were all lined up, six of them, with their hands tied. I shot them in their shins and watched them suffer for an entire day before finally deciding to shoot them in the head so that they would stop crying. Before I shot each man, I looked at him and saw how his eyes gave up hope and steadied before I pulled the trigger. I found their somber eyes irritating.  When I finished telling Esther the story, she had tears in her eyes, and she couldn't decide whether to rub my head, a traditional gesture indicating that things would be well, or hug me. In the end she did neither but said: ''None of what happened was your fault. You were just a little boy, and anytime you want to tell me anything, I am here to listen.'' She stared at me, trying to catch my eye so she could assure me of what she had just said. I became angry and regretted that I had told someone, a civilian, about my experience. I hated the ''It is not your fault'' line that all the staff members said every time anyone spoke about the war.  I got up, and as I started walking out of the hospital, Esther said, ''I will arrange a full checkup for you.'' She paused and then continued: ''Let me keep the Walkman. You don't want the others to envy you and steal it. I will be here every day, so you can come and listen to it anytime.'' I threw the Walkman at her and left, putting my fingers in my ears so I couldn't hear her say, ''It is not your fault.''  After that, whenever Esther would see me around, she'd smile and ask me how I was doing. At first I detested her intrusions. But slowly I came to appreciate them, even looked forward to them. It was like this at the center; most boys found a staff member whom they eventually began to trust. Mine was Esther.  Over the next few months, I started to visit Esther occasionally at the minihospital, which was just across the dirt road from the dorm that I shared with more than 35 boys. During that time, Esther got me to tell her some of my dreams. She would just listen and sit quietly with me. If she wanted to say anything, she would first ask, ''Would you like me to say something about your dream?'' Mostly I would say no and ask for the Walkman.  One day Esther gave me a Bob Marley tape and a really nice notebook and pen and suggested that I use them to write the lyrics of the songs and that we could learn them together. After that I visited Esther at the minihospital every day, to show her what I had written. I would sing her the parts of songs I had memorized. Memorizing lyrics left me little time to think about what happened in the war. As I grew comfortable with Esther, I talked to her mainly about Bob Marley's lyrics and Run-DMC's too. She mostly listened.  One night, close to my fifth month at the center, I fell asleep while reading the lyrics of a song. I startled awake after having a dream that involved lots of people stabbing and shooting one another, and I felt all their pain. The room I stood in filled with their blood. In the dream, I then went outside to sit at dinner with my father, mother and two brothers. They didn't seem to notice that I was covered with blood.  It was the first time I dreamed of my family since I started running away from the war. The next afternoon I went to see Esther, and she could tell that something was bothering me. ''Do you want to lie down?'' she asked, almost whispering.  ''I had this dream last night,'' I said looking away. ''I don't know what to make of it.''  She came and sat next to me and asked, ''Would you like to tell me about it?'' I didn't reply.  ''Or just talk about it out loud and pretend I am not here. I won't say anything. Only if you ask me.'' She sat quietly beside me. The quietness lasted for a while, and for some reason I began to tell her my dream.  At first she just listened to me, and then gradually she started asking questions to make me talk about the lives I had lived before and during the war. ''None of these things are your fault,'' she said, as she had repeated sternly at the end of every conversation. Even though I had heard that phrase from every staff member -- and had always hated it -- I began that day to believe it. That didn't make me immune to the guilt that I felt for what I had done. But it somehow lightened my burdensome memories and gave me strength to think about things. The more I spoke about my experiences to Esther, the more I began to cringe at the gruesome details, even though I didn't let her know that. I still didn't completely trust her. I only liked talking to her because I felt that she didn't judge me for what I had been a part of; she looked at me with the inviting eyes and welcoming smile that said I was still a child.  One day during my fifth month at Benin Home, I was sitting on a rock behind the classrooms when Esther came by. She sat next to me without uttering a word. She had my lyrics notebook in her hand. ''I feel as if there is nothing left for me to be alive for,'' I said slowly. ''I have no family, it is just me. No one will be able to tell stories about my childhood.'' I sniffled a bit.  Esther put her arms around me and pulled me closer to her. She shook me to get my full attention before she started. ''Think of me as your family, your sister.''  ''But I didn't have a sister,'' I replied.  ''Well, now you do,'' she said. ''You see, this is the beauty of starting a new family. You can have different kinds of family members.'' She looked at me directly, waiting for me to say something.  ''O.K., you can be my sister -- temporarily.'' I emphasized the last word.  ''That is fine with me. So will you come to see your temporary sister tomorrow, please?'' She covered her face as if she would be sad if I said no.  ''O.K., O.K., no need to be sad,'' I said, and we both laughed a bit.  Rejoining the Civilian World  Soon after, a group of visitors from the European Union, the United Nations, Unicef and several NGOs arrived at the center in a convoy of cars. At the request of the staff, we boys had prepared a talent show for them. I read a monologue from ''Julius Caesar'' and performed a short hip-hop play about the redemption of a former child soldier that I had written with Esther's encouragement. After that event, the head of the center asked me to be the spokesman for Benin Home and to speak about my experiences.  I was at the beginning of my seventh month at Benin Home when one of the field agents, Leslie, came to tell me that he was responsible for ''repatriating'' me -- the term used to describe the process of reuniting ex-child soldiers with their former communities. My family was dead, but I knew that my father had a brother whom I had never met who lived somewhere in Freetown. Leslie said he would try to find him, and if he couldn't, he'd find me a foster family to live with.  One Saturday afternoon about two weeks later, as I chatted with Esther at the minihospital, Leslie walked in, smiling widely. ''What is the good news?'' Esther asked. Leslie examined my curious face, then walked back to the door and opened it. A tall man walked in.  ''This is your uncle,'' Leslie proudly announced.  The man walked over to where I was sitting. He bent over and embraced me long and hard. My arms hung loose at my sides.  What if he is just some man pretending to be my uncle? I thought. The man let go of me. He was crying, which is when I began to believe that he was really my family, because men in Sierra Leone rarely cried.  He crouched on his heels next to me and began: ''I am sorry I never came to see you all those years. I wish I had met you before today. But we can't go back now. We just have to start from here. I am sorry for your losses.'' He looked at Leslie and continued: ''After you are done here, you can come and live with me and my family. You are my son. I don't have much, but I will give you a place to sleep, food and my love.'' He put his arms around me.  No one had called me ''son'' in a very long time. I didn't know what to say. Everyone, it seemed, was waiting for my response. I turned to my uncle, smiled at him and said: ''Thank you for coming to see me. I really appreciate that you have offered me to stay with you. But I don't even know you.'' I put my head down.  ''As I said, we cannot go back,'' he replied, rubbing my head and laughing a little. ''But we can start from here. I am your family, and that is enough for us to begin liking each other.''  I got up and hugged my uncle, and he embraced me harder than he had the first time and kissed me on my forehead. We briefly stood in silence before he began to speak again. ''I will visit you every weekend. And if it is O.K., I would like you to come home with me at some point, to see where I live and to meet my wife and children -- your family.'' My uncle's voice trembled; he was trying to hold back sobs. He rubbed my head with one hand and shook Leslie's hand with the other.  As my uncle promised, he came to visit every weekend. We would take long walks together, and they gave me a chance to get to know him. He told me about what my father was like when he was a child, and I told him about my childhood. I needed to talk about those good times before the war. But the more I heard and talked about my father, the more I missed my mother and brothers too.  About a month or so later at Benin Home, Leslie told me it was time for me to go live with my uncle. I was happy, but I was also worried about living with a family. I had been on my own for years and had taken care of myself without any guidance from anyone. If I distanced myself from the family, I was afraid that I might look ungrateful to my uncle, who didn't have to take me in; I was worried about what would happen when my nightmares took hold of me. How was I going to explain my sadness, which I was unable to hide when it took over my face, to my new family, especially the children?  I lay in my bed night after night staring at the ceiling and thinking, Why have I survived the war? Why was I the last person in my immediate family to be alive? I went to see Esther every day, though, and would say hello, ask how she was and then get lost in my own head thinking about what life was going to be like after the center. At night, I sat quietly on the veranda with my friends. I wouldn't notice when they left the bench that we all sat on.  When the day of my repatriation finally came, I walked to the minihospital building where I was to wait, my heart beating very fast. My friends Alhaji and Mambu and a boy named Mohamed were sitting on the front steps, and Esther emerged, smiling. Leslie sat in a nearby van waiting to take me to my new home.  ''I have to go,'' I said to everyone, my voice shaking. I extended my hand to Mohamed, but instead of shaking it, he leapt up and hugged me. Mambu embraced me while Mohamed was still holding me. He squeezed me hard, as if he knew it was goodbye forever. (After I left the center, Mambu's family refused to take him in, and he ended up back on the front lines.) At the end of the hug, Alhaji shook hands with me. We squeezed each other's hands and stared into each other's eyes, remembering all that we had been through. I never saw him again, since he continually moved from one foster home to another. Esther stepped forward, her eyes watery. She hugged me tighter than she ever had. I didn't return her hug very well, as I was busy trying to hold back my tears. After she let go, she gave me a piece of paper. ''This is my address,'' she said. ''Come by anytime.''  I went to Esther's home several weeks after that. But my timing wasn't good. She was on her way to work. She hugged me, and this time I squeezed back; this made her laugh after we stood apart. She looked me straight in the eyes. ''Come and see me next weekend so we can have more time to catch up, O.K.?'' she said. She was wearing her white uniform and was on her way to take on other traumatized children. It must be tough living with so many war stories. I was living with just one, mine, and it was difficult. Why does she do it? Why do they all do it? I thought as we went our separate ways. It was the last time I saw her. I loved her but never told her.

That is not a big thing for Mr. Watkins, the chief executive of Seagate, which makes hard disk drives. But it is enough space to hold 600,000 songs, 584,000 photographs and 1,000 hours of TV shows.  All of that material can be displayed on the giant flat-panel TV spread across one wall in the media room and distributed to the six TVs and numerous speakers throughout the house.  Call it tech envy, but I wondered if I could set up a system on a wireless home network so my own photos, videos and movies could be viewed from any TV in the house, and an entire collection of music could be summoned from any stereo. Could I do it with equipment available at a big chain like Best Buy or Circuit City?  ''The answer to that is easy: no,'' said Dan Sokol, a technology analyst with the Envisioneering Group, electronic engineering consultants in Seaford, N.Y. The problem, according to Mr. Sokol, is that there are dozens of pieces of incompatible electronic equipment involved in this kind of project.  I refused to take Mr. Sokol's ''no'' for an answer -- and set out to build a home media network for less than $1,000. I understood there would be plenty of hurdles. Devices coming out of the world of information technology, like PCs and networking equipment, are just beginning to communicate with the devices that come out of the world of home electronics, like TVs and stereos.  Both industries have been working out standards through an alphabet soup of trade associations. They are hoping that all of those devices, and cellphones, printers and digital cameras, will start making sense to each other this year. Best Buy just started selling a whole system in a box that will handle entertainment and control your thermostats and lights for $15,000.  Device manufacturers are convinced that consumers will want interconnectivity. Parks Associates, a technology industry consulting firm, estimates that by 2010, some 30 million American homes will have a home entertainment network. (Right now only about half of the 43 million American homes with broadband Internet connections even have a home network, so this seems like an optimistic projection.)  ''Connected entertainment is near and dear to our heart,'' said Jan-Luc Blakborn, director of digital entertainment at Hewlett-Packard. ''We clearly see connected entertainment as an area where we can grow. It is starting to happen.''  At present I can buy a Sonos or Squeezebox device to play music throughout the house -- but those can only handle music. Another device, the Slingbox, can send TV programs to a PC anywhere in the world over the Internet. But I do not want to watch TV on a 15-inch notebook screen when I can watch it on a 42-inch TV.  Then there is TiVo. It had the potential to become the leading home entertainment hub. A free download of TiVo Desktop software to a PC allows video from your TiVo to be watched anywhere and anytime on that PC. If you have a second TV, any program recorded on one TiVo box can stream effortlessly to any other TiVo elsewhere in the house.  But this is really an example of a lost opportunity. TiVo stores video in a proprietary digital format that prevents it from being viewed on non-TiVo devices, and the files are not recognized by other hardware, which is the problem that led Mr. Sokol to declare that my efforts would be futile.  James Denney, vice president for product marketing at TiVo, said the company had not set out to be the center of everything. ''Our approach is that there isn't one hub in the house,'' he said. ''Our role is a display device near the TV.''  TiVo also does nothing for my collection of DVDs. It is difficult to watch a movie on DVD over a home network without first copying it to a hard drive. Software for doing this is widely available, but it is illegal to bypass the copy protection on a DVD, even one that you own. Systems for sending copy-protected video around the house are still largely works in progress.  Another problem I encountered was a lack of advice. Few of the devices needed to assemble my network are even advertised by retailers or manufacturers. Sony, for instance, has a number of devices under the LocationFree name that can be used to move TV shows to a PlayStation Portable game machine or a small TV monitor outdoors, but it seems to be keeping this a secret. Hewlett-Packard is selling what it calls the MediaSmart TV, a 37-inch L.C.D. set that locates your wireless home network and pulls in content. It is a nice product, but it will not work for this project; it costs $2,000.  To build a homemade networked entertainment system, I needed a network, of course. Older wireless routers using the 802.11b standard will move video data so slowly that it will be nearly unwatchable. So the wireless router has to be upgraded to 802.11g or the even newer 802.11n standard.  Here is where this project started getting expensive. Wireless devices anywhere on the network that are still using the older technology will slow the whole network. I have to upgrade them, too, for about $50 each.  Music, movies and photos can be stored on the hard drive of any computer connected to the network. But because TV shows or movies can fill up a PC's hard drive much faster than photos or music files do, it can make sense to centralize everything on an always-available external hard drive.  ''The way I view it, being a nerd, the storage device is as important as the media center,'' said Mike Scott, technical media manager at D-Link, a maker of home networking equipment.  There are now drives on the market that can hold as much as a terabyte, enough space to hold about 90 hours of high-definition TV. That much storage will cost a bit more than $500, but prices keep falling.  I decided to use a kind of external hard drive known as a network-attached storage device. Although they cost about $100 more than regular drives, they come with software that will organize files and help all the devices on the network find the drive. The Maxtor Shared Storage II drive that I chose, which holds 1 terabyte and costs about $680, was up and running in less than 10 minutes.  One alternative is buy a $100 device called a network storage link that is plugged in between a regular external drive and the router. That offers more flexibility if I buy a lower-capacity drive that needs to be upgraded later.  The next step is attaching a media adapter to a TV or a stereo to pick up the programming from the network. D-Link sells one called the MediaLounge Media Player for less than $300. (A fancier model just hit the market for $600.) This is essentially a DVD player with a built-in wireless adapter that enables it to locate photos, movies and music on the network's hard drives. A similar device from D-Link, which costs about $180, can connect to any stereo receiver so that music files are always accessible. The drawback is that I needed one of these adapters for every TV and stereo.  The home entertainment network that I jury-rigged wasn't nearly as slick as Mr. Watkins's setup. But then it only cost me about $850, not including the cost of my existing computers and TV. I spent more time moving music and video files to the hard drive than I spent actually setting it up. Once the content was there, I could do exactly what I wanted to do: view whatever I wanted, wherever I wanted.  If all of this sounds like too much effort, you can always wait. Almost every consumer electronics company is set to announce its answer to home entertainment connectivity at the Consumer Electronics Show next week. As with all consumer electronics, the devices coming out next year will do more for less. I can only hope they will be just a little bit easier to put together.  BASICS  ",

                    "text": "  Seton Hall announced a heaping portion of bad news before Friday night's game against Georgetown. Its starting center and tallest player, the 6-foot-10 Grant Billmeier, was lost for the season.  The Pirates never seemed to rebound -- literally and figuratively.  Georgetown raced to an early lead and it dominated the boards in a 74-58 victory at Continental Arena.  ''I've been a head coach eight years, and I've never seen a stat where we got beat on the boards, 39 to 11,'' Seton Hall Coach Bobby Gonzalez said. ''We had one defensive rebound at halftime.''  It got worse in the second half, when the Pirates (11-7, 3-3 Big East) managed only four rebounds.  Georgetown (13-5, 3-2) had a significant height advantage. It started three players who were 6-8 or taller, including the 7-2 center Roy Hibbert. Seton Hall's tallest starter was Stan Gaines, who was listed at 6-7.  Billmeier, a tri-captain, tore his left anterior cruciate ligament while playing defense during the opening minutes of Wednesday's 69-68 victory against Providence. He started 14 times this season and averaged 3.4 points and 3.4 rebounds a game.  ''He gives you 15, 20 minutes a night,'' Gonzalez said of Billmeier. ''He changes the rotation, he is a senior, he does play hard. He's a great energy guy. And so now you have one less body. It's a small team getting smaller.''  John Garcia, at 6-9, became Seton Hall's tallest player. He came off the bench to grab three rebounds, which tied Paul Gause for the team high. Georgetown, which had been ranked eighth in the preseason but has fizzled out of the Top 25, had six players with at least three rebounds. DaJuan Summers had a game-high 10 rebounds and 17 points.  ''If I'm going to give this team anything, it's rebounds,'' Garcia said. ''I'm not going to make excuses.''  Gonzalez hinted at an excuse anyway, saying that Seton Hall was fatigued from playing four games in nine days. And when the Hoyas raced to a 10-0 lead after just 2 minutes 10 seconds, the Pirates were not able to recover. They trailed, 34-21, at halftime and fell behind by as many as 20 points late in the game.  Jonathan Wallace led Georgetown with a career-high 21 points, and he helped break down Seton Hall's full-court pressure and zone defense.  ''We handled their pressure better than I anticipated,'' Georgetown Coach John Thompson III said. ''Our guys were very poised and pretty attentive and seeing when their teammates were in trouble.''  Brian Laing scored a team-high 19 points for the Pirates. But like five of his teammates, he had no rebounds.  ''We just didn't have the bodies and the energy and the juice to play a team like Georgetown tonight,'' Gonzalez said. ''It's just that simple.''  LOYOLA, MD. 62, ST. PETER'S 55 -- Michael Tuck made four free throws in the final 11 seconds and finished with 14 points as Loyola of Maryland beat host Saint Peter's.  Gerald Brown and Marquis Sullivan also scored 14 points each for the Greyhounds (10-7, 6-1 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference), and Brett Harvey had a game-high eight assists.  Akeem Gooding had 16 points and 6 rebounds -- both game highs -- to lead the Peacocks (3-15, 1-7), who made just 37 percent of their shots. Kevin Spann added 12 points, and Todd Sowell finished with 11 and Raul Orta had 10.  Loyola led for most of the game but had trouble putting away the Peacocks, who rallied late and tied the score at 55-55 when Brandon Brock hit a jumper with 56 seconds left.  But the Greyhounds closed the game with a 7-0 run keyed by Tuck's free throws. (AP)  FAIRFIELD 72, SIENA 67 -- Michael Van Schaick scored 27 points to lead Fairfield in a victory against host Siena.  Fairfield (5-15, 3-5 MAAC) rallied from a 9-point deficit with 5:32 remaining for the victory.  Van Schaick tied the score at 66-66 with his fifth 3-pointer of the game with a minute left.  After Kenny Hasbrouck missed a jumper for Siena, Van Schaick was fouled with 30 seconds left and converted both free throws.  Siena (9-8, 5-3) had a chance to tie, but David Ryan missed the first of two free throws with 22 seconds left.  After Jonathan Han made two free throws to put Fairfield up, 70-67, with 16 seconds to go, the Saints failed to get a shot off.  Hasbrouck led the Saints with 23 points, and Michael Haddix had 14 points and 14 rebounds.  Siena shot 46 percent from the field and 38 percent from 3-point range. The Saints limited the Stags to just 39 percent from the floor and 36 percent from long range. (AP)  WOMEN  MARYLAND 95, VIRGINIA 68 -- Crystal Langhorne had 17 points and 12 rebounds, Laura Harper had 21, and No. 3 Maryland bounced back from its first loss of the season by cruising past visiting Virginia.  Kristi Toliver scored 20 points and Marissa Coleman added 16 for the Terrapins (19-1, 3-1 Atlantic Coast Conference), the defending national champions, who were coming off an 82-61 defeat at Duke on Saturday that dropped them from the top spot in the Associated Press poll.  Lyndra Littles led Virginia (12-6, 2-2) with a career-high-tying 23points. The Cavaliers have lost fourin a row at Maryland. (AP)  COLLEGES  ",

Bloomberg announced yesterday that Coney Island Commons had been selected to develop a community center and moderate-cost housing near Surf Avenue in Coney Island. The project, expected to start in the fall of 2008 and finish the following summer, involves the construction of 152 housing units in two buildings between West 29th and West 30th Streets, of which 75 percent will be for low- and moderate-income people. The $56 million development is also expected to provide a 40,000-square-foot community center that will be operated by the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York.  ",

                    "text": "  Isabel Bayrakdarian, the soprano, and Russell Braun, the baritone, were to have shared a recital on Sunday afternoon at the Morgan Library & Museum. Both singers are Canadian, as are the pianists they work with, and at the last minute, visa problems prevented Mr. Braun from traveling to New York. So Ms. Bayrakdarian and her pianist, Serouj Kradjian (they are also married), added two groups of songs and a solo piano work to the Schubert and Pauline Viardot groups they had planned, and had the recital all to themselves.  The amended program was a tour of national styles filtered through 19th- and early-20th-century sensibilities, and Ms. Bayrakdarian was at her most vivid when the music drew most overtly on folk music and dance roots. She gave a florid account of ''L'Invito,'' the bolero from Rossini's ''Soir\u00e9es Musicales,'' for example, and her reading of the ''Tarantella Napoletana'' from the same set was brisk, fiery and suffused with an undercurrent of sensuality.  Ernesto Lecuona's ''Malague\u00f1a'' was enlivened with a similarly vital performance. Here, and in its companion works in her Spanish set -- ''Del cabello m\u00e1s sutil'' and ''Chiquitita la novia'' by Fernando Obradors -- Ms. Bayrakdarian caught the essence of the music in her subtly shifting tempos and flamenco-tinged vocalise passages.  Spain seemed to exert an unusual pull on Ms. Bayrakdarian and Mr. Kradjian. Two of the Viardot songs, ''Madrid'' and ''Havanaise,'' emphasized the composer's Spanish roots and drew on flamenco figuration as fully as the Obradors songs. On the other hand, in his pastel-hued performance of Granados's ''Quejas o la maja y el ruise\u00f1or,'' from ''Goyescas,'' Mr. Kradjian highlighted the stylistic connections between Granados and his French contemporary Ravel.  Ms. Bayrakdarian put Viardot's Gallic side in the spotlight as well, by way of gracefully turned performances of ''Sylvie,'' the gently macabre ''Enfant et la m\u00e8re'' and the swirling ''Aime-moi,'' a reworking of a Chopin mazurka.  The recital, part of the series that the George London Foundation has presented at the Morgan since 1995, began with a group of Schubert songs in which Ms. Bayrakdarian acclimated herself to the small, acoustically bright new hall. At first she seemed to overestimate the power she needed, but by the third song, she had taken the room's measure, giving a beautifully serene performance of ''Nacht und Tr\u00e4ume'' that showed her interpretive flexibility and expressive sound to fine effect.  The sporano Andrea Gruber and the tenor Russell Thomas will sing the next recital in the George London Foundation's series at the Morgan Library & Museum on March 18.  MUSIC REVIEW  ",

                    "text": "  The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying rules, overcoming bipartisan reluctance to ban many of the favors that lobbyists do for lawmakers and to illuminate the shadowy legislative practice of earmarking money for special projects.  The Senate's action makes the start of the 110th Congress a watershed moment in the history of K Street and Capitol Hill. Interpreting the results of the Nov. 7 election as a reaction to corruption scandals when Congress was under Republican control, the Senate has joined the House in adopting broad new rules that go beyond the proposals Republicans introduced last year, the ones that Democrats campaigned on, or the extensive changes House Democrats recently passed.  The measure passed around 9 p.m. by a vote of 96 to 2. Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, both Republicans, were the only members to vote against the bill.  On Wednesday, Senate Republicans nearly derailed the bill in a dispute over when the Democrats would agree to vote on a Republican proposal, a version of the line-item veto. At a news conference Thursday, a half-dozen Democratic senators competed to belittle the Republicans' line-item veto as ''an excuse,'' ''a ploy,'' ''a subterfuge,'' a ''rabbit out of a hat'' and ''a grand act of ethics hypocrisy.''  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the leader of the new Democratic majority, threatened to postpone any action on ethics until the next election and publicly blame the Republicans if they did not allow a vote Thursday.  But by Thursday evening, Mr. Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had resolved the impasse. They agreed to hold a vote on the line-item veto as part of a minimum-wage debate next week.  ''This legislation has been extremely difficult to deal with,'' Mr. Reid said Thursday night. ''It is difficult because it deals with our lives.''  ''In the short-term, the reforms in this bill may take some getting used to,'' he added, ''but in the long term, we'll be thankful we took these steps.''  Like the new House rules, the Senate bill bars members from accepting gifts, meals or trips from lobbyists or the organizations that employ them. It ends the use by senators of borrowed corporate jets at discount rates.  Also like the House rules, the Senate measure requires disclosure of the sponsors, the purpose and the cost of the pet projects, or earmarks, that lawmakers have been able to tuck anonymously into complicated spending bills.  Unlike the House, the bill would also explicitly prohibit earmarks that would benefit the immediate family of the senator who sponsored it. Many of those changes revise internal Senate rules and do not require House or presidential approval.  Senate Democrats also incorporated into the bill a provision that, if signed into law, would require for the first time that lobbyists disclose the most valuable favors they do for lawmakers: holding campaign fund-raisers, soliciting campaign contributions and bundling checks from clients and friends.  Of all the bill's provisions, it was the disclosure requirements for bundled checks that met the stiffest resistance behind the scenes in the Democratic caucus because of the potential to make it harder for incumbent lawmakers to tap K Street lobbyists as surrogate fund-raisers, aides involved in negotiations over the bill said, speaking anonymously because the talks were confidential.  Addressing another loophole in campaign finance laws, the Senate bill would also bar lobbyists or their employers from giving parties to honor lawmakers at party conventions. House Democrats say they plan to take up the subject of lobbying rules on their side of the Capitol in the next several weeks.  The party leaders began by teaming up to introduce a much weaker bipartisan bill, and lawmakers in both parties acknowledged behind-the-scenes resistance to strengthening it. But many found amendments to strengthen the bill -- a number of them offered by Senators Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin and Barack Obama of Illinois, both Democrats -- politically difficult to oppose.  Fred Wertheimer, president of the ethics group Democracy 21, said, ''These are always difficult battles, but when you get them on the floor you get votes of 96 to 2.''  The bill became a pivotal test for Mr. Reid in his new role trying to manage the Senate. He is a frequent target of Republican accusations of fraternizing with influence-peddlers. Several members of his immediate family have worked as lobbyists, although he says that none have lobbied his office, and he is among the biggest recipients of the discounted use of corporate jets for travel.  Mr. Reid promised vigorous reform as his first act as majority leader. He offered an amendment to bar lawmakers from accepting the discounted use of corporate jets.  But when a Republican senator offered an amendment to match the House's earmark disclosure rules, Mr. Reid miscounted the votes he had on his side when he tried and failed to table the measure. Mr. Reid first argued against moving too fast to match the House Democrats' new rules and then embraced the same idea with token modifications.  Mr. Coburn, one of the two ''no'' votes, said he had been troubled by a lack of openness in the negotiations over the contents of the bill. Senators Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat who is recovering from health problems, and Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, were absent and did not vote.  ",

                    "text": "  The Roman Catholic Church leadership of Poland called Friday for all of the country's bishops to be investigated for past ties to the secret police.  ''We will ask a special commission to check the past of all our bishops,'' the Council of Bishops' chief, Jozef Michalski, told reporters in Warsaw after the episcopate's 45 bishops held an emergency meeting to deal with the worst crisis to hit the Polish church in years. It culminated last Sunday, when Warsaw's archbishop of just two days, Stanislaw Wielgus, resigned after admitting that he had collaborated with the reviled Communist-era Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service.  Newspapers digging into archives of the secret police have followed with reports that other senior clergymen were once collaborators. The Rev. Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski, who has researched the subject, is about to come out with a book naming 39 priests, including three bishops, who collaborated with the secret police between 1944 and 1989.  The scandal, which has already tarnished the Catholic Church's image as an unimpeachable moral authority during the Communist years, has caused chaos in a church already divided between liberal and conservative camps.  ''The situation is so difficult, it would be impossible for the bishops to stay silent,'' the Rev. Jozef Kloch, the spokesman of the bishops' council, said on Friday. He said the bishops were discussing a systematic way of dealing with the files.  The revelations have embarrassed the Vatican, which has complained that Bishop Wielgus misled Pope Benedict XVI about the depth of his ties until the Polish news media published his file.  But the Polish church, together with the Vatican under Pope John Paul II, a Pole, has been criticized for keeping collaboration among the clergy quiet -- even though it was widely known inside the church that up to 10 percent of priests, monks and nuns had some contact with the Polish secret police.  Even after the news media began revealing cases of collaboration after John Paul died, the Polish church chose to treat the matter internally.  With Archbishop Wielgus's resignation, the scandal has forced the church to be more aggressive. It is not clear what the church will do with bishops it finds collaborated.  ",

                    "text": "  American companies sold more goods like airplanes, cars and precious metals overseas in November, helping to narrow the trade deficit for a third consecutive month.  Despite the improvement, the United States is still on track to end 2006 with a record trade imbalance, eclipsing the $716.7 billion deficit in 2005.  The Census Bureau reported yesterday that the trade deficit -- the amount by which the value of America's imports of goods and services exceeded the value of its exports -- fell to $58.2 billion in November, the smallest it has been since July 2005. In October, the deficit was $58.8 billion.  Yesterday's figures surprised many economists, most of whom expected the deficit to widen. Through November, the cumulative deficit for 2006 was $701.6 billion, well within reach of the previous record.  But some economists expect the trade outlook to improve this year as a weaker dollar combined with a slower domestic economy and stronger growth overseas help narrow the disparity between imports and exports.  ''The factors that are causing the improvement are really in the case of exports and the strengths of the economies abroad,'' said Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with the Bank of America. ''Japan continues to grow moderately, and emerging Asia is growing at a good clip, led by China. Then Europe also continues to at least outperform expectations. When you put all of that together, that's a boost to U.S. exports.''  In November, exports grew to $124.8 billion, from $123.7 billion in October. The increase was fairly broad-based. Exports of consumer goods like jewelry and sporting goods rose, as did exports of heavy duty goods like parts for commercial aircraft.  At the same time, imports are slowing. American businesses imported $183 billion worth of goods and services in November, up $500 million from October. That brought the three-month moving average for imports down to $184.3 billion, the lowest level since June.  The gap narrowed in November in part because Americans bought fewer goods from China, one of the nation's main trading partners. The net deficit with China fell to $22.9 billion in November, down from $24.4 billion in October. Also, the trade gap shrank because of the third monthly decline in petroleum imports, a factor that economists expect to help improve the trade gap this year if oil prices continue falling.  The Chinese government reported its full-year trade figures yesterday as well, posting a record surplus of $177.5 billion with the world as a whole in 2006. China's exports, and its surplus, continue to grow rapidly; the 2006 surplus was 75 percent greater than 2005's. Imbalanced trade with China has become an issue straining relations with the United States.  Top American officials, including the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, traveled to China last month to press for a shift in the country's trade and currency policies. China accounts for a larger portion of the deficit than any other country.  A reason that Washington says that trade with China remains one-sided is the exchange rate. China keeps its currency, the yuan, loosely pegged to the dollar and the euro at a level that many economists say is undervalued, making its exports affordable and imported goods more expensive.  But economists expect Chinese imports to have less appeal in the United States as a slowing housing market damps consumer appetites.  ''I imagine as U.S. domestic demand growth slows,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist with Capital Economics, ''the wider trade deficit with China will probably continue to grow, but probably at a slower pace.''  Also yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that inventories at American wholesalers accumulated in November at the fastest pace in three months, a sign that imports could slow further.  Surplus Widens in Canada  OTTAWA, Jan. 10 (Bloomberg News) -- Canada's trade surplus widened more than expected in November to the largest since March, as exports of cars and energy products rebounded.  The surplus widened to 4.67 billion Canadian dollars ($3.97 billion), from a revised 3.76 billion Canadian dollars in October, Statistics Canada said. Exports rose 2.8 percent, to 38.1 billion Canadian dollars ($32.4 billion).  ",

                    "text": "  The McCormick Tribune Foundation, the second-largest shareholder in the Tribune Company, said yesterday that it had hired a buyout firm to advise it on a course of action while the Tribune Company is on the block.  The foundation's five directors are all current or former members of the Tribune Company management and could influence the company's decision whether to sell some or all of its assets. The foundation and the company said they had taken steps to avoid any conflicts of interest.  A person close to the process said bids for the company were due Jan. 17. Its assets include The Los Angeles Times, 10 other newspapers, two dozen television stations and the Chicago Cubs.  Joseph A. Hays, a spokesman for the foundation, said it had hired the Blackstone Group buyout firm as part of its fiduciary responsibilities because 75 percent of the value of the foundation is in Tribune stock. Blackstone is to review the company's financial information and advise it on a course of action.  ''It's a full range of opportunities, from standing pat to divesting stock to acquiring stock, and in between there is infinity,'' Mr. Hays said.  The McCormack Foundation, founded at the death of Col. Robert R. McCormick in 1955, finances an array of charities. It has an 11.7 percent stake in Tribune. The Cantigny Foundation, which is associated with the McCormick Foundation and owns 1.4 percent of the shares, has joined in retaining Blackstone.  Tribune's biggest shareholder is the Chandler family, which owns 20 percent and has expressed interest in buying the company.  The foundation said it had set up a special advisory committee of two of its five board members to direct Blackstone's work. Those two -- James C. Dowdle and John W. Madigan -- are retired Tribune executives. The other three are current members of the Tribune Company management: Dennis FitzSimons, chairman and chief executive; Scott C. Smith, president of Tribune publishing; and David Hiller, publisher of The Los Angeles Times. Colonel McCormick stipulated in his will that the foundation's directors be current or former officers of the Tribune Company, but that has raised questions of potential conflicts of interest.  Daniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a watchdog group in Chicago, said it was not clear where the board's interests began and the company's interests left off. He said it was unusual for a foundation to have so much of its assets invested in one company. He also questioned whether only two of the five directors could decide the foundation's course of action, given that they do not constitute a majority.  In a regulatory filing yesterday, the foundation said that the three current executives ''have been isolated from this process on behalf of the foundation,'' referring to the potential sale of Tribune. In addition, Mr. FitzSimons sent an internal note to employees saying, ''Given our role as current officers of the company, Scott, David and I have voluntarily recused ourselves from any deliberations regarding alternatives'' for the foundation's investment in the Tribune Company.  Mr. Hays said that Mr. Madigan owned stock in Tribune and that Mr. Dowdle did not. He said Mr. Madigan's stock ownership did not pose a conflict because ''his interests are aligned with the foundation.''  Until recently, Mr. Madigan was a special partner at Madison Dearborn, a private equity firm that is considering a bid for Tribune; the firm said yesterday he had left to avoid any appearance of a conflict.  Late in the day, the foundation said it was receiving so many questions about its intentions in establishing an advisory committee that it issued a statement saying the move ''should in no way be construed as a reflection on the management of Tribune Company.'' The committee, it said, ''continues to have complete confidence in Tribune Company management.''  As a philanthropic organization, the foundation could not make a bid itself for Tribune because it has no cash. But it could participate in a deal with a private equity firm or another company. ''This is where a financial adviser would be helpful,'' a person close to the process said.  The Chandlers started the process that led to the auction of the Tribune Company when they expressed displeasure last year at the company's slumping stock price and said management was muddled. The Tribune Company said it would examine its strategic options, including the sale of part or all of its assets.  Correction:  January 6, 2007, Saturday  A picture caption in Business Day yesterday about a decision by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, a large shareholder in the Tribune Company, to hire the Blackstone Group as an adviser while the Tribune is up for sale, misstated the role of the company's chief executive, Dennis FitzSimons, in the sales process. Mr. FitzSimons, who is also chairman of the foundation's board, has recused himself from issues regarding the sale; he is not a member of the special committee dealing with the Blackstone Group.  ",

                    "text": "  Israel transferred $100 million in Palestinian tax revenues to the office of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, as part of a plan to bolster him and keep money out of the hands of the Hamas government, Israeli officials said Friday.  The money is intended to meet needs for food, medicine and other basic expenses but not to pay the overdue salaries of Palestinian government workers, according to Israeli officials.  It was transferred ''to a special account to ensure the money does not reach the Hamas government and cannot be used for perpetrating terror against Israel,'' according to a statement from the office of Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert.  Israel collects more than $50 million a month in taxes and customs money on behalf of the Palestinians under an arrangement dating from the 1990s, when the two sides were holding peace negotiations.  However, Israel began withholding the money after Hamas won the Palestinian elections a year ago, gaining control of the cabinet and legislature. Israel has not said precisely how much money it has withheld, but it is believed to be over $500 million.  At a meeting last month, Mr. Olmert agreed to hand over $100 million as part of a package of moves designed to help Mr. Abbas in his power struggle with Hamas. Israel also has removed some West Bank roadblocks, but Palestinians say they still face many obstacles when they seek to travel.  Palestinians say that the money belongs to their government and that it is not up to Israel to dictate how it should be spent. ''Israel can say whatever it wants,'' said Muhammad Dahlan, a Palestinian legislator and a leading member of Mr. Abbas's Fatah movement. ''This is our money.''  Israel has not said whether it would release more money in the future. Before Israel began withholding the money last year, it was sent to the Palestinian Finance Ministry.  Also on Friday, Defense Minister Amir Peretz of Israel suspended the establishment of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.  When Mr. Peretz said on Dec. 26 that he had approved the Maskiot settlement in the Jordan Valley, it provoked sharp criticism by the Palestinians, as well as American concern.  Mr. Peretz ordered a ''freeze in the plans for Maskiot in order to evaluate them thoroughly,'' his office said in a statement. The plans called for the construction of about 30 homes for settlers to be built on an old army base.  Israel has more than 100 formal settlements in the West Bank and many informal ones. Israel pledged to stop building new settlements in the 1990s, and the so-called road map, the stalled Mideast peace plan introduced in 2003, calls for Israel to freeze settlement activity.  Still, the population of the Israeli settlements on West Bank is increasing by more than 10,000 a year, and is now more than 250,000. The figure does not include residents of East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war and later annexed.  In another development, Mr. Abbas is traveling to Syria, where he will hold talks with President Bashar al-Assad. He will also be looking for a solution to the deadlock between his Fatah movement and Hamas, the two main Palestinian factions.  The factions have been trying, without success, to form a national unity government for months, while gunmen from the two groups have periodically battled in the streets.  Mr. Abbas's envoys have been holding talks with Hamas leaders in Damascus, the Syrian capital, including Hamas's exiled political chief, Khaled Mashal. Palestinian officials say a meeting between Mr. Abbas and Mr. Mashal is possible, though not certain.  In remarks on Friday, Mr. Abbas said again that the Palestinians should establish a government that would be acceptable to the international community, or hold new elections. ''It is very clear how to get a national unity government that can break the siege,'' he said in the West Bank city of Ramallah after playing host to the European Union foreign policy chief, Javier Solana.  A 10-year-old Palestinian girl, Abir Aramin, died Friday from wounds sustained when she was hit by fire from the Israeli border police on Tuesday in the West Bank town of Anata, near Jerusalem, Palestinian witnesses and relatives said. Abir and her classmates were on recess from school when the Israeli forces fired on stone-throwing Palestinians with rubber bullets and stun grenades, according to the Palestinians.  Abir was hit in the head and collapsed, the Palestinians said. The border police said they were investigating the report.  ",

Sunday afternoon, for example, he conducts ''Pioneering Influence: C\u00e9sar Franck.'' The Frenchman Franck, often thought of as a 19th-century also-ran, is presented here as a powerful influence upon French composers who followed him, including Ernest Chausson, Paul Dukas (of ''Sorcerer's Apprentice'' fame) and the little-known Alb\u00e9ric Magnard. The program concludes with Franck's stormy Symphony in D minor. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $27 to $55.  This week the WEILL MUSIC INSTITUTE AT CARNEGIE HALL presents a workshop with the eminent German organist and conductor HELMUTH RILLING. A chorus of volunteers, auditioned and prepared by Kathy Saltzman Romey, will be rehearsed and conducted by Mr. Rilling in a performance of Bach's ''St. Matthew'' Passion on Saturday night, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's and a roster of vocal soloists. Saturday at 7 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $25 to $82.  ERNST KRENEK'S ''REISEBUCH AUS DEN \u00d6STERREICHISCHEN ALPEN'' (''Diary From the Austrian Alps''), a major song cycle inspired by Schubert's ''Winterreise,'' is seldom performed, let alone complete. Krenek (1900-91), the Austrian modernist composer, has yet to get his due. So this concert on Tuesday in the intimate hall of the Austrian Cultural Forum is timely. The tenor Volker Vogel performs, accompanied by the pianist Ann Beckman. 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300; free, but reservations required.  The kinetic conductor ZUBIN MEHTA, once the music director of the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, is back leading the orchestra in a work that will test his profundity, Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. The program includes Elgar's Cello Concerto with the brilliant young Alisa Weilerstein as soloist. Thursday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $28 to $96.

                    "text": "  The Nets will be without Richard Jefferson, their starting small forward, for about six weeks after he has arthroscopic surgery today to remove loose fragments from his right ankle.  Jefferson is the team's second-leading scorer, and the news comes during one of the Nets' most promising stretches of the season. They beat the Orlando Magic on Saturday night for their ninth victory in 11 games and got back to .500 for the first time in two months.  The Nets (20-20) start a five-game trip to the West on Monday night with a game against the Kings in Sacramento. The trip could be an indicator of what direction the Nets, the leaders of the Atlantic Division, will take for the remainder of the season.  Jefferson, who has been bothered by ankle problems all season, chose to have the surgery now because his ankle was not getting better, said Rod Thorn, the Nets' president. Jefferson took two cortisone shots earlier this season, and Thorn said they were not working. Having the surgery now avoids the possibility of Jefferson's ankle becoming so bad that he would have to miss the rest of the season.  ''He's just not able to do the type things that he can do,'' Thorn said during a telephone interview yesterday. ''He's playing about 50, 55 percent. It's tough for him. He's a young guy, still in the early part of his career. It's mentally a tough situation.''  If Jefferson recovers in six weeks, he should be back by early March, when the Nets have a six-game trip.  Coach Lawrence Frank said his team needed to find a way to cope with Jefferson's absence.  ''Injuries happen throughout the course of the season, so regardless of how you're playing, where you're playing, that's the unfortunate reality of pro sports,'' he said by telephone.  Regardless of who plays in place of Jefferson, Frank added, ''We understand we have to be consistent.''  Jefferson missed five games early in the season after rolling his left ankle, and the second-year swingman Antoine Wright started in his place.  But Wright has fallen out of the rotation and Frank said he was not sure who would replace Jefferson. Frank said matchups could dictate his starting lineup, which may change from game to game.  Jefferson was averaging 16.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists this season, all below his career averages. But he seemed to be battling through the pain and was showing flashes of his usual explosiveness. In a victory against the Knicks on Friday night, he scored 21 points.  Many credited Jefferson's improved play at times for the team's turnaround from an 11-18 record.  Jefferson's problems date to last season's playoffs, when he sprained his right ankle in the second round against the Miami Heat. He tweaked the ankle again in the off-season. The problems with the ankle resurfaced during a game against the Milwaukee Bucks in mid-December. Jefferson sat out the second half of that game because it was sore, and he missed the next game, at Toronto.  Jefferson, 26, has always prided himself on his ability to play through pain, and the nagging injury has frustrated him.  Last month, Jefferson said of his statistics: ''We're looking at some of the lows of my career. It's not acceptable.''  And after Saturday night's game, Jefferson dismissed a question about whether he would make the trip, saying: ''You're not asking me any questions about this. Come on, guys.''  Thorn said he did not believe that Jefferson's ankle problems would threaten his career.  Jefferson will be the fifth Nets player to have surgery this season. The most serious injury has been to their starting center, Nenad Krstic, who will miss the rest of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in late December. Krstic was the Nets' second-leading scorer at the time of his injury.  ''You can't lose players like Richard now, on top of Nenad,'' Thorn said. ''It's going to affect your team, obviously. We are just coming into one of the most difficult periods of our schedule. The players are going to have to play an increased role.''  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Introduced on Monday: Changfeng Liebao CS7  Is it real? Since 1999, Changfeng has been churning out Mitsubishi-based S.U.V.'s and pickups for China and other markets, but not the United States, Japan or Europe. The CS7 is its latest concept S.U.V.  What's the point? To crush Detroit's spirit and suck out its manufacturing soul. Just kidding -- though automakers in Detroit, Europe and Japan are tripping over themselves to strike partnerships with companies like Changfeng to manufacture cars in China.  What they said: Liebao means cheetah in Chinese, and as the company's inspiring video noted, ''The cheetahs are leaping into the new century.'' Li Jianxin, the company's chairman, noted Chanfeng's rapid 10-year transformation from a small military repair company to China's No. 1 seller of S.U.V.'s, with more than 23,000 sales in 2006.  What they didn't say: No word on when Changfeng might cross the Great Wall between  it and buyers in the United States. Company officials acknowledge the brand must overcome hurdles, including setting up a dealer network and meeting pollution and safety standards.  What makes it tick? A Mitsubishi-derived 2-liter 114-horsepower engine delivers power to a four-wheel-drive system.  How much, how soon? Liebao may sell a similar production model around 2008  in China, Africa, South America and other markets, for roughly $15,000.  How's it look? Sitting on the display stand in the cellar of Cobo Hall, it looked like a rejected Kia design, circa 1995, rescued from a Seoul wastebasket and smuggled to Hunan.  ",

                    "text": "  WHEN I last had fondue, it was at a bustling place in Geneva, where the supercilious waiter knew we were tourists and treated us accordingly. I declared then that I wouldn't be craving bread dunked in melted cheese for a very long time.  A very long time turned out to be 16 months. But this time I didn't have to endure an all-night flight and navigate a foreign language. Pheasants Landing, which has a Swiss chef, Andre Gross, serves a fine fondue and several other tasty dishes as well.  The restaurant is owned by Heinz Keller, who closed his Auberge Swiss in Berkeley Heights in 2001 to open this party-friendly place in Hillsborough the following year, according to Vicky Starace, the manager. Set well off the road and surrounded by lawns, it is brightly lighted and easily seen from a distance. Parking is plentiful, but first-timers are left wondering how to get in, because there are no signs directing diners to the entrance, in the back.  Inside, the mood warms considerably. Floors are honeyed wood, lighting is hearthlike, and rooms are home-scale.  A cheese fondue seemed equally cozy, and it was. Spiked with Kirschwasser (a cherry liqueur) and white wine, it was served with bread and apples for dipping, and did double duty as food and conversation piece. There's a proper way to stir fondue, with a queenly wave, a figure-eight motion, to keep it from sticking on the bottom, said one member of our party. Then there was the discussion of etiquette surrounding the retrieval of food gone missing in the depths.  Appetizers, which lent themselves to less social interaction, were successful anyway. They included a duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 with its fruity Cumberland sauce and accompanying salad of celery and walnuts; roasted red peppers over fresh mozzarella, drizzled with a basil vinaigrette; and Swiss onion soup, topped with Emmenthal cheese.  The Caesar salad was more compelling than the Greek version, possibly because the Parmesan used in the Caesar was more noticeable than the feta in the Greek. Crab cakes were overly seasoned and overworked, with no visible chunks of meat; house-made spinach dumplings were delicately flavored, once they had been fished from their sea of sauce. The pasta encircling a pheasant filling in the ravioli special, however, was less than tender.  Main dishes were more consistent, particularly the European specialties: the slab of tender sauerbraten, marinated steak, in brown gravy, accompanied by a heap of steaming hot spaetzle and marinated red cabbage; the hunter schnitzel, a tender disc of fried veal served with a typical Burgundy-mushroom sauce, again with cabbage and spaetzle; and the wiener schnitzel, the fried veal without the gravy.  There were a few standouts among the game specials, which are offered in winter and change weekly. Venison stew was delicious, the meat made tender by a red wine marinade and braising with mushrooms, pearl onions and bacon and served with more of the spaetzle. A close second was the game sampler, which included a sweetish smoked duck sausage infused with apple brandy, a tender venison loin and wild boar medallions wrapped in bacon.  A New York strip steak was nicely cooked as well, though the garlic mashed potatoes seemed rote next to the beautiful, golden-brown, crisp-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside r\u00f6sti, a Swiss version of hash browns that was enriched with bacon and onions. Pheasant, however, was a disappointment, overcooked and dry on two separate visits.  Among the many menu items I didn't try, the fish and chips, made with cod in a beer batter, is atop my list. The best bet for dessert is not the house-made apple strudel, which had a floppy crust and steaming filling, but Mr. Gross's walnut and caramel-fudge tart. Order it when you place your meal order and ask the server to allow your piece to sit out of the refrigerator during dinner. That way the flavors enhance each other -- just the way the satisfying food at Pheasants Landing complements a winter evening.

This week, in his review of Barbara Ehrenreich's ''Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy,'' Pinsky considers the cultural importance of Carnival, rock concerts and other celebratory mass events -- phenomena not as far from the world of poetry as it might seem. ''The emotional force of mass gatherings has profound importance,'' he explained in an e-mail message. ''I think we are desperate for something to counterbalance performances, great though they may be, that we experience electronically. We crave something else, something more personal as well as communal.'' The public readings sponsored by the Favorite Poem Project, he says, ''are among the most interesting group events I have witnessed: less performance than participation, and with a spirit hard to name, but unforgettable, and generated not just by each reader or poem, but by everyone there, together.'' His review begins on Page 10.  The Editors  ",

                    "text": "  Several Somali Islamist fighters and possibly some of their leaders were arrested trying to escape into Kenya, Kenyan authorities said Wednesday, raising the possibility of a sticky asylum issue.  ''We have detained a number of people, but we are still trying to determine their identities,'' said Alfred Mutua, the spokesman for the Kenyan government.  Somali officials said Kenyan soldiers might have captured Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, the second in command of the defeated Islamist forces.  According to Ismail Qasim Naji, a Somali general, Sheik Sharif's briefcase was recently discovered at a jungle hide-out in southern Somalia.  ''It had some important documents in it,'' General Naji said at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia's seaside capital. When asked what documents, the general replied, ''Top secret.''  Ethiopian-led forces routed Somalia's Islamist army last month after the Islamists attacked Baidoa, the seat of Somalia's transitional government. The American military jumped in last week, bombing two areas in southern Somalia where the Islamist leaders and several terrorist suspects were believed to be hiding. A small contingent of American Special Operations soldiers have been deployed on Somali soil to help track down suspects and identify any bodies.  Since then, the Islamists have been caught between the advancing Ethiopian-led army and the heavily fortified Kenyan border near the Indian Ocean, which is being patrolled by American warships.  United Nations officials said the Kenyan government was deliberating whether to grant Islamist leaders political asylum, in the interest of bringing the fighting across the border to a close by allowing the Islamist leaders a graceful exit from the country. Somalia's transitional government officials have agreed to give amnesty to rank-and-file fighters but said that they wanted the top Islamists handed over to them.  ''Any members of the upper echelons of the Islamists who still pose a threat to our security will face due process of the law in Somalia,'' said Abdirizak Adam Hassan, chief of staff for the transitional president, Abdullahi Yusuf. ''As for terrorists, we will give them to the Americans or the U.N.''  In Baidoa, lawmakers on Wednesday ousted the speaker of Parliament, Sharif Hassan Sheik Adan.  Mr. Adan, an illiterate livestock trader, was recently one of the most powerful men in Somalia. But he fell out of favor with President Yusuf and Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi after he tried to strike a peace deal between the Islamists and the transitional government. He also demanded that Ethiopian troops leave Somalia.  Members of Parliament accused him of being a traitor and voted 183 to 9 to remove him. A replacement has yet to be named.  Mr. Adan rejected the vote, telling a Somali radio station on Wednesday, ''The country is illegally occupied by Ethiopia, and the M.P.s were probably forced to vote against me.''  ",

I'd like to say a few words  In defense of our country  Whose people aren't bad nor are they mean  Now the leaders we have  While they're the worst that we've had  Are hardly the worst this poor world has seen  Let's turn history's pages, shall we?  Take the Caesars for example  Why within the first few of them  They had split Gaul into three parts  Fed the Christians to the lions  And burned down the City  And one of 'em  Appointed his own horse Consul of the Empire  That's like vice president or something  That's not a very good example, is it?  But wait, here's one, the Spanish Inquisition  They put people in a terrible position  I don't even like to think about it  Well, sometimes I like to think about it  Just a few words in defense of our country  Whose time at the top  Could be coming to an end  Now we don't want their love  And respect at this point is pretty much out of the question  But in times like these  We sure could use a friend  Hitler. Stalin.  Men who need no introduction  King Leopold of Belgium. That's right.  Everyone thinks he's so great  Well he owned The Congo  He tore it up too  He took the diamonds, he took the gold  He took the silver  Know what he left them with?  Malaria  A president once said,  ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself''  Now it seems like we're supposed to be afraid  It's patriotic in fact and color coded  And what are we supposed to be afraid of?  Why, of being afraid  That's what terror means, doesn't it?  That's what it used to mean  The end of an empire is messy at best  And this empire is ending  Like all the rest  Like the Spanish Armada adrift on the sea  We're adrift in the land of the brave  And the home of the free  Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.  ",

                    "text": "  In March, necessity moved Carmen Laureano and her two daughters from Florida to New York City.  Ms. Laureano, 36, lost her job when the day care center where she had worked for about three years came under new ownership. ''Everything changed for me; everything was down,'' she said.  She moved with her girls, Luz and Franchesca Rivera, 12 and 10, to the Bronx, hoping to stay with her mother. But the young family could not stay in her mother's housing complex for the elderly. She and the girls quickly found themselves homeless and entered the shelter system.  ''For the people living in the shelter it's not that easy to get out,'' Ms. Laureano said. But she did. With persistence, determination and some help from Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, Ms. Laureano has made a new city her family's new home.  In June, they moved into a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, and Ms. Laureano gave the bedroom to her daughters so they ''could have privacy.'' Framed family photos hang in the living room, where Ms. Laureano sleeps.  For a year, the $925 monthly rent is covered by Housing Stability Plus, a Department of Homeless Services program that offers a five-year subsidy that decreases gradually each year. Ms. Laureano is already worried about paying next year's rent.  ''I'm going to start studying because in one year I have to work,'' she said. Since moving here in the spring, Ms. Laureano has spent her time finding housing, schools and medical services for her family and caring for her daughters. She plans to take computer classes with the help of Catholic Charities. ''I have to start paying rent by myself.''  Her willingness to work is real, but so are her worries. Caring for Franchesca takes a special effort. ''Franchesca is a special girl,'' Ms. Laureano said. A lack of oxygen to her daughter's brain during birth caused mild mental retardation and behavioral problems. Ms. Laureano must be home when Franchesca returns from school. ''I have to be here, at 3; I have to be downstairs,'' she said.  Finding the right school to meet her daughter's needs was also a challenge. When they arrived in New York, Franchesca was mistakenly put in mainstream classes.  ''My daughter was in regular class and it was a mess,'' Ms. Laureano said. Franchesca was disruptive and could not do the work. ''It was hard for her, for the teacher, for the students.''  Ms. Laureano found help and a feeling of home, at the Thorpe Family Residence in the Bronx, where the family lived while it was homeless. The Thorpe residence is affiliated with Catholic Charities, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Thorpe staff connected Ms. Laureano to the services she needed. ''They give you support,'' she said. ''They help you out a lot. They are like a family.''  Counselors at Thorpe referred her to medical and educational services for Franchesca, and Ms. Laureano did considerable work following through. ''I have to start from the shelter, then I have to talk with the social worker to see if she could help me,'' she said, ''I went to two schools before I get that school.''  The school is Public School 161, where Franchesca started in the fall. She is in Spanish-language special education classes with her peers, working at a first-grade level. The family is from Puerto Rico, and Ms. Laureano taught herself English in Florida. Luz, in the sixth grade, speaks both Spanish and English, but is in some bilingual classes to provide better comprehension.  Franchesca, who speaks Spanish, was crying on the first day. But, by the second day, ''she was the friend of the teacher,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Being taught in Spanish and working with children at her level has made a big difference for Franchesca.  ''Mommy, Mommy, I know how to read!'' Ms. Laureano remembered her daughter announcing one day after school. The family celebrated, ''We made a party,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Ms. Laureano was also referred to a clinic for her daughter's mental health issues, and Franchesca received new medication to control her behavior. Now, Franchesca is calm and more focused, Ms. Laureano said. ''She could really learn. She could hear. Without the medication she just wants to fight.''  The family's monthly income is limited to $145 in public assistance and $255 in food stamps. With the help of staff members at Thorpe, Ms. Laureano is applying for Social Security supplemental income for Franchesca.  Two weeks after school began, the family received $425 in Neediest Cases money for school clothes, shoes, socks and underwear. The family also bought four folding chairs to put around a dining table. ''Thank you for all the help,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Franchesca is shy around strangers. She stayed in the bedroom and sometimes hid under the covers. She is not shy with her family. ''No way,'' Ms. Laureano laughed. ''It's different when we three are alone.''

                    "text": "  The Roman Catholic Church in Poland was in turmoil on Monday as a second prelate stepped down because of his Communist-era secret police ties, after Sunday's resignation of this city's archbishop over similar allegations.  Questions spread about just how broad and deep a stain secret-police collaboration has left on a church long regarded as a beacon of faith and freedom during the Communist era. Many people also have asked how or why the Vatican could have invited the storm by appointing a man to such a sensitive post despite knowing that he had a clouded past.  ''The people responsible for the procedure of appointing such candidates applied the traditional way of doing it, which means it was without an investigation and was based on their confidence in the truthfulness of the candidate,'' said the Rev. Dariusz Kowalczyk, head of the Jesuits in Warsaw.  In short, church officials from Warsaw to Rome suggested that the archbishop, Stanislaw Wielgus, alone was to blame.  But many people here worry that a mishandling of the affair could permanently damage the last major bastion of Roman Catholic faithful in Europe at a time when the Polish church is already facing the secularizing trend that has emptied churches in Italy, France and Spain.  While cases of Communist collaboration by Polish clergy members have made headlines before, the latest threatens to set off what some worry could be a pernicious cycle of exposures that could erode the church's image.  Just a day after Archbishop Wielgus resigned after admitting that he had collaborated with the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, the Rev. Janusz Bielanski resigned as rector of Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, the burial site of Polish kings and queens. Father Bielanski cited ''repeated allegations about his cooperation with the secret services'' in his resignation.  The archbishop's resignation has divided the church between those, like Cardinal Jozef Glemp, who were angered that public pressure had scuttled the appointment and the 60 percent who wanted him to step down, according to a recent survey.  The cardinal, who held the archbishop's post before the appointment of Bishop Wielgus and was reappointed to the job temporarily after the resignation, publicly defended Bishop Wielgus on Sunday.  Poland's conservative Dziennik daily newspaper called Cardinal Glemp's defense a ''huge mistake,'' writing that ''he didn't even mention that the archbishop lied to the last minute. That he lied to the pope, bishops and faithful.''  The turmoil in Poland reverberated back to the Vatican, amid deepening questions of why officials gave such strong support to Bishop Wielgus's contentious appointment in a place of such importance to the Catholic Church.  One of Pope Benedict XVI's greatest concerns is the rapidly declining church attendance around Europe. In May, he visited Poland to urge the nation not to uproot itself from the church as it modernized in other ways. ''Stand firm in your faith!'' he exclaimed.  Any deep erosion of faith in Poland as a result of disclosures that priests collaborated with the Communists would be troubling for a pope elected to re-evangelize Europe as a whole.  George Weigel, a Catholic writer who has taught in Poland for the last 15 years, said he did not believe that the Wielgus case alone could provoke such wide distrust.  ''The danger is for the future,'' he said. ''If you don't acknowledge that there were problems with a very small minority of people, and that some of them included the clergy, then you run the risk of seeming to be avoiding the truth.''  Mr. Weigel said the Polish church should appoint its own commission to review the secret-police files -- and to explain publicly what it finds.  The case has also raised questions among church experts about Benedict's papacy. While some experts like Mr. Weigel maintain that the case says more about the difficulties inside Poland, others drew similarities with the uproar Benedict caused after he delivered a speech in September that seemed to equate Islam with violence.  In both cases, they say, a pope with an impeccable grasp of theology and doctrine seemed tone-deaf to politics. They say they believe that either he has been ill served by his advisers or, as has been reported often in the Italian news media, makes many important decisions alone.  ''I think this hurts the pope's credibility, and I think we will see more of this if he continues to try to do it alone,'' said Robert Mickens, a Vatican expert for The Tablet, a liberal British Catholic magazine.  In a letter to Polish bishops on Saturday, Bishop Wielgus wrote that soon after his nomination to the archbishop's post he had informed the pope and other Vatican officials of ''being entangled in contacts with the secret services of past times.''  The Vatican could have asked the bishop for access to any files related to his entanglement that might have existed in the secret-police archives. It is not clear whether the Vatican did so before it appointed him to the job. Such files did exist and were eventually leaked to the Polish news media, leading to the archbishop's resignation.  Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the Vatican official responsible for appointing bishops, said that in this case, church officials simply did not know the full story of Bishop Wielgus's past.  Joaqu\u00edn Navarro-Valls, until earlier this year the Vatican's chief spokesman, wrote an article in the Italian daily La Repubblica on Monday outlining the difficulties imposed by the Communists, which often forced priests and others to become compromised.  ''Wielgus would never have been allowed to study abroad if he had not agreed to the compromise offered him by the regime,'' he wrote. ''And this situation was common for many of his compatriots, whether priests or not.''  An exception, he said, was Karol Wojtyla, the Polish priest and cardinal who became Pope John Paul II in 1978. While Father Wojtyla was permitted to study in Rome in the late 1940s and also attended the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s, Dr. Navarro-Valls said in an interview that it was ''absolutely impossible'' that he was compromised, though he was regularly approached by the police.  But in his article, he said John Paul urged understanding of the difficulties the Communists posed to Poles. ''One must learn and forgive,'' he quoted the pope as saying.  ",

Ms. Novalle plans to open another T Salon in the Chelsea Market, 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street), in about eight weeks.

A warning by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- that looming Social Security and Medicare deficits would burden the economy for years to come if they were not addressed -- pulled down the markets on Thursday. His comments came at a Senate hearing.  On top of that, Wall Street was disappointed by technology earnings reports, including those of bellwethers like Apple, Intel and I.B.M. Apple's shares fell 7.7 percent for the week, among the worst performances in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Among the Dow industrials, I.B.M.'s drop of 2.5 percent and Intel's decline of 5 percent were among the worst for the week.  For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.45 points, or 0.08 percent, to close at 12,565.53. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.23 point, or 0.02 percent, to close at 1,430.50. The Nasdaq composite index fell 51.51 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 2,451.31. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.78 percent from 4.77 percent the previous week.  JEFF SOMMER  ",

                    "text": "  It is an open secret that many members of Congress from both parties would be relieved to scuttle proposed changes in ethics rules. After all, the changes tend to limit the personal perks and political advantages of their positions.  In the Senate, that wish appeared to come true on Wednesday. A proposed ethics overhaul collapsed when a procedural question turned into a feud between the Democratic and Republican leaders, each accusing the other of failing to address a major theme of the fall elections.  By about 10 p.m., the proposals appeared dead for now after 46 Senate Republicans blocked a vote on a broad ethics and lobbying bill. Fifty Democrats and one Republican, Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, supported going ahead with the vote, but under Senate rules, 65 votes were needed to prevail.  In an interview after the vote, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and majority leader, said, ''The Republicans killed ethics reform, period. There is no way to put frosting on this. This is as sour as any piece of legislation.''  Mr. Reid said he would give the Republicans another chance to vote for the bill Thursday afternoon, but then would set the measure aside if they did not come around. The 21 Republican senators who will be up for re-election in 2008 ''for the next two years are going to have to go home and explain what they did to try to destroy the most significant ethics and lobbying reform since Watergate,'' Mr. Reid said.  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, called Mr. Reid's accusations spin. He said the issue was Mr. Reid's refusal to hold a vote on a Republican proposal to include in the ethics bill a version of a presidential line-item veto, a provision that Mr. Reid said was irrelevant to ethics.  Mr. McConnell argued that such a veto power would help eliminate waste or corruption from the pet spending projects known as earmarks, which lawmakers tuck into complicated legislation.  Although Mr. Reid publicly vowed to hold another vote on a presidential line-item veto, Mr. McConnell said the Republicans would block passage of the ethics-and-lobbying rules package unless Mr. Reid allowed a vote on the proposal as an amendment.  ''No amount of spin is going to convince anyone that Republicans don't want to pass this bill,'' Mr. McConnell said in a speech on the floor.  The Senate ethics and lobbying reform bill under debate was introduced by the leaders of both parties and closely resembles a bill passed under Republican control last year. It is considerably weaker than a counterpart bill that the House recently passed. But roll calls on a series of proposed amendments are forcing lawmakers to choose between casting embarrassing no votes or accepting more sweeping changes.  The new House rules, for example, includes a prohibition on House members' accepting gifts, meals or trips paid for by lobbyists; a ban on accepting discounted use of corporate jets; and a requirement of public disclosure of the sponsor, cost and purpose of each earmark.  The original Senate ethics bill included looser restrictions and major loopholes. Mr. Reid, one of the biggest users of discounted corporate jet trips, introduced an amendment to roughly match the House rules on gifts, meals or jet use.  But when a Republican introduced a proposed amendment to match the House requirement on earmarks, Mr. Reid tried unsuccessfully to block it. Then he embraced it with small modifications.  Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi and a former party leader, said he was ''amused'' by the fracas. ''I guess there is a little bit of a manhood thing here where one side is going to show the other,'' Mr. Lott said.  Still, Mr. Lott, who oversaw the weaker bill that was introduced last year, also acknowledged some impatience with the zeal for new rules.  ''It's gotten out of control,'' Mr. Lott said. ''We're involved in a long process of self-flagellation.''  Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, agreed. ''I think this whole process has gotten out of control,'' he said. ''Only in Washington, when somebody like Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham breaks the law, you suddenly have to change the law.''  THE 110TH CONGRESS  ",

NATO said up to 150 insurgents might have been killed in the fighting.  Two large groups of insurgents were spotted gathering on the Pakistan side of the border and were tracked as they crossed into Afghanistan, NATO said in a statement released in Kabul.  Afghan Army soldiers and NATO troops laid an ambush for the groups about half a mile inside Afghanistan, using air and ground forces, said Gen. Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.  The insurgents were in trucks loaded with men and weapons and crossed the border about 2 a.m., General Azimi said. Afghan and NATO forces set up an ambush in a deserted area near the border, he said. He reported no Afghan or NATO casualties, but estimated that about 80 insurgents were killed. The clash occurred in the Barmal district of Paktika Province, which borders the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, one of the most lawless areas of the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Militants from both countries, along with hundreds of foreign fighters, operate Taliban training camps there and mount frequent attacks across the border into Afghanistan.  The Pakistani military guards the border but has failed to stem cross-border attacks; NATO officials say there has been a marked increase in infiltration at the border since September compared with last year.  ''Pakistani military liaison officers were kept fully informed throughout the operation,'' NATO said in its statement.  ",

                    "text": "  By the time Robbie Gould lined up for Sunday's game-winning field goal in overtime, some of his teammates were more nervous than he was.  ''I didn't want to watch it,'' Chicago Bears quarterback Rex Grossman said. ''I didn't see the hold or anything.''  What happened next sent Chicago into celebration. Thanks to Gould's 49-yard field goal, the longest in Bears postseason history, Chicago edged the Seattle Seahawks, 27-24, and will play host to the New Orleans Saints next Sunday for the National Football Conference championship.  Gould's kick, which came 4 minutes 58 seconds into overtime and equaled his career long, did more than just win a playoff game. It lifted a psychological burden from the Bears, who had been beaten at home during their previous two playoff appearances and had not won a playoff game since Jan. 1, 1995. Had the Bears lost this game, it would have cheapened their 13-3 regular season and their N.F.C. North title, sending them into another off-season feeling as if they had underachieved.  Instead, Chicago has a chance to reach the Super Bowl for the first time in 21 seasons. The Bears were far from dominant against the Seahawks, allowing running back Shaun Alexander to rush for 108 yards, and falling behind, 24-21, in the fourth quarter. But when it mattered, Gould delivered. He kicked a 41-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to tie the score, then followed with his game-winner.  The Bears mobbed Gould afterward, knowing that his kick had liberated them from heavy criticism.  ''We didn't play good the whole game, we played good enough to win,'' Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher said. ''It's like a monkey off our back. That was a good big kick -- bad field, 49 yards, windy. That's why he's first-team All-Pro.''  Gould has been a clutch performer for the Bears all season, making his first 24 field-goal attempts, and 32 of 36 over all during the regular season. On Dec. 17, Gould kicked a 25-yard field goal to defeat Tampa Bay in overtime.  Despite the pressure and the importance of Sunday's kick, he tried to treat it as routinely as possible.  ''It wasn't an easy kick, but you want the opportunity,'' said Gould, in his second season with the Bears since going undrafted out of Penn State.  ''This is obviously a big win for our team, keeping our season alive.''  For Chicago, it was a narrow escape. Gould's winning field goal completed the Bears' first possession in overtime, after Seattle won the overtime coin toss but stalled on its drive. Seahawks punter Ryan Plackemeier muffed a punt that traveled only 18 yards, giving the Bears a first down on their 34-yard line. Moments later, Grossman (21 for 38, 282 yards, one touchdown, one interception) completed a key 30-yard pass to Rashied Davis, and the Bears eventually drove to Seattle's 32, setting up Gould's winning kick.  The Bears will play in the conference championship game for the first time since the 1988 season.  Most of the pregame focus was on Grossman's inconsistent play all season, but this game was about all of the Bears. After last season's playoff loss, 29-21 to Carolina, the Bears came back strong, finishing with the best record in the conference. But another one-and-done playoff experience would have been more anguishing.  ''Last night I talked to the team about finishing,'' Bears Coach Lovie Smith said. ''Last year we were in this position, and we weren't able to finish the season the way we wanted. We talked about all we've gone through this year, how it would be a shame not to finish the game on a high note.''  The Seahawks did not go easily. Trailing by 21-14 at halftime, Seattle scored 10 consecutive points to take its first lead. After a 40-yard field goal by Josh Brown cut Seattle's deficit to 21-17, the Seahawks put together a seven-play, 51-yard touchdown drive. On third-and-10 from Chicago's 13-yard line, Alexander found a gaping hole in Chicago's defensive line and rumbled into the end zone, putting the Seahawks ahead, 24-21, with just under five minutes left in the third quarter.  One could almost hear the doubt creeping into Soldier Field when Seattle took the lead, but the Bears showed their resiliency. Grossman's pass was intercepted by Pete Hunter deep in Seattle's territory to end a drive early in the fourth quarter, but the Bears did not panic.  Chicago almost took the lead a few minutes later, but an apparent 66-yard punt return for a touchdown by Devin Hester was nullified because of an illegal block in the back. Once again, the Bears responded, driving 48 yards to Seattle's 23, setting up Gould's 41-yard field goal into the wind that barely sneaked over the crossbar with 4:24 left in regulation, tying the score.  The Seahawks had chances to win in regulation, but they were thwarted on their final two fourth-quarter possessions. Just after the two-minute warning, Seattle had fourth-and-1 from Chicago's 44. Seahawks Coach Mike Holmgren elected to go for the first down, but the play's timing was thrown off after Matt Hasselbeck bobbled the snap. When Alexander finally received the handoff from Hasselbeck, he was thrown for a 2-yard loss by linebacker Lance Briggs.  After stopping the Bears and getting the ball back, the Seahawks threatened again, driving from their 20 to Chicago's 45 with 30 seconds left in regulation. But Chicago defensive tackle Tank Johnson, who was arrested last month on misdemeanor weapons charges, sacked Hasselbeck for a 9-yard loss with 24 seconds to play in regulation.  ''We know what Tank is as a football player,'' Urlacher said. ''It was a big play.''  Time expired in regulation, and after the Bears stopped Seattle and got the ball in overtime, Grossman set up Gould's kick with his 30-yard completion to Davis.  ''The pattern was open all game,'' Davis said. ''Rex was waiting for a big play to come my way. I'm just elated.''  All the Bears were elated, because their season was still alive.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  To reach the Super Bowl, to finally fill in the blanks on the glittering r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that lacked postseason glory, even the Indianapolis Colts conceded it was only appropriate that they would have to vanquish their greatest tormentors.  The New England Patriots had used the Colts as doormats on two of their three Super Bowl runs, stepping over them on the way to constructing a dynasty. But Sunday night, like the kids who had had enough of being beaten up by the class bullies, the Colts fought back. They rallied from an 18-point deficit, then traded scores with the Patriots in a thrilling second half to win the American Football Conference title, 38-34, and advance to Super Bowl XLI on Feb. 4 in Miami.  There, the Colts will play the Chicago Bears, who won the National Football Conference championship game earlier in the day, creating a meeting of great significance: Colts Coach Tony Dungy and Bears Coach Lovie Smith, Dungy's close friend, will become the first black head coaches to lead teams at the Super Bowl.  The victory also sent quarterback Peyton Manning to the Super Bowl for the first time, and he and Dungy can leave behind some of their baggage -- that their successful careers may never be capped by their sport's greatest honor. This was an especially meaningful performance by Manning (27 of 47 for 349 yards and a touchdown), who was criticized for his previous postseason failures as much as he was praised for his statistical dominance.  But he recovered from a shaky start to produce scoring drive after scoring drive in a relentless second half that included a total of eight scores, four of them Colts touchdowns.  The comeback was the biggest in championship game history, and the brilliance of Manning's regular-season play finally transferred to the postseason with a winning drive that may rival the one produced by John Elway against Cleveland 20 years ago. The seven-play, 80-yard drive, which included a pinpoint-perfect 32-yard pass to tight end Bryan Fletcher on the left sideline, ended with the winning touchdown -- a 3-yard run by Joseph Addai with one minute left. It was the first time the Colts led in the game.  Celebration of Dungy's historical milestone, he said, could wait for another day. He wanted the Colts, who had struggled with a leaky run defense all season and had lost three of their last five regular-season games, to enjoy their first trip to the Super Bowl since the Colts moved to Indianapolis in 1984.  ''We had to do it the hard way,'' Dungy said. ''We had to go through a great champion. It's fitting. Our team went the hard way the whole year.''  The Colts endured a remarkable early onslaught by the Patriots, who took a 21-3 lead in the second quarter when Patriots cornerback Asante Samuel returned an interception 39 yards for a touchdown. Manning said later that he had wanted to make up for that play, and he would get his chance much later. But the beginning of the comeback was nearly unnoticed by Colts fans, who were stunned into silence by the yawning deficit.  The Colts kicked a field goal just before the end of the first half, cutting their deficit to 21-6, and that, Dungy said, infused the locker room with energy during halftime. He spoke to his players about being just two scores down, and said that if they could get a good kickoff return and score on their opening drive, they would trail by just one score. Dungy's calm permeates the Colts, and when Manning scored on a 1-yard sneak on the first Colts drive of the third quarter, a blowout was on its way to becoming an instant classic.  ''You don't envision getting down, 21-3, to the New England Patriots,'' Manning said. ''It didn't feel like things were going that bad. It was my fault it was 21-3.''  It was the defense's fault that the Colts had played so poorly at the end of the regular season, losing their bid to have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. But the defense, with the fireplug safety Bob Sanders back from a knee injury, righted itself when the playoffs began, carrying the team to victories against the Chiefs and the Ravens even as Manning struggled. The Colts relied on the defense again to start the comeback.  When they held the Patriots to three downs and out on their first drive of the third quarter, Dungy's halftime speech proved prophetic in the most improbable way. The Colts are laden with offensive talent, but Manning's first touchdown pass of the game did not go to one of his high-profile receivers. It went instead to Dan Klecko, a backup defensive tackle who used to play for New England. Manning rolled to his right and hit Klecko for the 1-yard touchdown pass.  When Marvin Harrison, who was held to four receptions for 41 yards by the Patriots, spun around to catch a 2-point conversion, the score was suddenly -- and very briefly -- tied.  Patriots cornerback Ellis Hobbs had set up that touchdown when he bumped receiver Reggie Wayne in the end zone, giving the Colts first-and-goal on the 1. Redemption came quickly. Hobbs returned the ensuing kickoff 80 yards to put the Patriots at the Colts' 21.  On third-and-goal from the 6, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady saw Jabar Gaffney in the back of the end zone. Gaffney leaped and caught the pass, coming down with his left foot inbounds. Officials ruled that he was pushed out, so the touchdown counted. But a replay on the RCA Dome's video screen indicated that Gaffney might have stepped out of bounds before he leaped for the ball. The touchdown stood and the Patriots led again.  The scoring continued until the Colts finally halted the Patriots at the Colts' 25. The Patriots rookie kicker Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 43-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 34-31 lead with 3:49 remaining.  ''We let too many opportunities get away,'' Brady said. ''We had the ball in good field position at certain times. We should have got the ball in the end zone.''  In years past, a 3-point lead would have been enough for the Patriots to cling to. But they have been unusually erratic this season, and of all things, their defense failed them this time. They looked exhausted, and that was just enough of an opening for Manning, whose record-setting career had lacked a defining moment.  By hitting Fletcher on a play that Fletcher called for himself, the triumphs that had so often belonged to Brady and the Patriots in the past six years were finally snatched away by Manning. When Addai ran in untouched to put Indianapolis ahead, Manning worried that the Colts had left too much time on the clock. He got to the bench and bowed his head, praying, as the Patriots took over with only a minute left.  When cornerback Marlin Jackson intercepted Brady's pass at the Colts' 35 with 16 seconds to play, the Patriots' stranglehold on the Colts was over, and so was Manning's postseason futility. The dynasty was put aside while the monkey was removed from Manning's back.  ''I don't know if you're supposed to pray for things like that,'' Manning said. ''I can remember the disappointment of three years ago, when we lost the A.F.C. championship in Foxborough. I don't get into monkeys or vindication. I don't play that card.''  But Manning had gotten those 7 points back. And he had, at long last, led the Colts to the Super Bowl. Prayers answered.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  MANY investors have been heeding market strategists' advice to reduce portfolio risk by putting more money into stable, high-quality, dividend-paying stocks.  But instead of plowing this money into large-capitalization companies based in the United States, investors have redirected much of it into shares of blue-chip foreign companies based largely in Western Europe and Japan.  Indeed, foreign large-cap blend funds -- which primarily invest in blue-chip growth and value stocks in developed markets -- were the most popular category of funds through the first 11 months of 2006, according to the Financial Research Corporation in Boston.  Foreign large-blend funds attracted $43.8 billion of net new money during this stretch. By comparison, highflying diversified emerging-market stock funds attracted $6.6 billion and domestic large-blend funds drew $4 billion, according to Financial Research.  But does investing in blue chips abroad achieve the same results for a portfolio as investing in big, high-quality domestic stocks?  The answer is still no, given the currency risks that you inevitably take on when investing abroad. Yet a growing number of people argue that foreign and domestic stocks are becoming more alike, given the increased correlation among the world's markets.  Since 1970, for example, the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index, for European, Australian and Far Eastern stocks, has returned 11.6 percent a year, on average. That is nearly identical to the annualized gain of 11.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of domestic blue chips.  But keep in mind that those slightly higher gains came with slightly higher risk, as foreign stocks on their own are still more volatile than domestic equities.  Sometimes, a modest dose of a risky asset can make an entire portfolio less volatile. From 1970 to 2005, a 100 percent stock portfolio invested in the S.& P. 500 would have earned 11.1 percent, annualized, according to S.& P. And that is with a so-called standard deviation -- a popular measure of volatility -- of 16.8. But by moving 25 percent of that money from the S.& P. 500 to the EAFE index, the portfolio would have earned 11.4 percent a year, on average, with a slightly lower standard deviation of 16.4.  Add too much, however, and more volatility enters the mix. In this case, had 75 percent of the equity stake been invested in the EAFE index and 25 percent in the S.& P. 500, the portfolio would have earned the same 11.4 percent, annualized, from 1970 to 2005. But the portfolio's volatility would have shot up to 19.1.  This shows that while the global markets may be moving more in sync, ''the world markets aren't completely integrated yet,'' said James D. Peterson, vice president of the Schwab Center for Investment Research in San Francisco.  Consider the recent performance of foreign and domestic blue chips. Over the last five years, the average foreign large-blend fund returned 13.8 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracker, as many foreign economies have grown faster than that of the United States and as the dollar has weakened of late.  By comparison, domestic large-cap blend funds advanced only 6.3 percent a year, on average, during this stretch. And last year, foreign blue-chip funds soared 25.1 percent, beating the returns of domestic blue-chip funds by more than 10 percentage points.  Arguably, much of the investor interest in foreign blue chips can be attributed to their outperformance, not to their similarities to their domestic counterparts.  ''A lot of people just want to be exposed to foreign because it's been doing so well,'' said Ronald W. Rog\u00e9, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y. ''It's performance chasing.''  To be sure, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the EAFE index has been 0.8 over the last three years, according to Morningstar. On paper, that is fairly high, because a correlation of 1.0 implies that two assets are moving in perfect tandem.  But consider that over this same stretch, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the Russell 2000 index of small domestic stocks was actually greater, 0.83, according to Morningstar. Yet investors take it on faith that large-cap and small-cap stocks are entirely different asset classes.  There are several reasons for continuing to treat foreign and domestic blue-chip stocks separately. ''A big reason is the issue of currency,'' Mr. Peterson said.  Investors who put money to work in a foreign market should consider that market's volatility, as well as that of the currency in which its stocks trade.  In 2006, the EAFE index rose 13.8 percent when measured in local currencies, according to MSCI. But for Americans to make an investment abroad, money must first be converted from dollars to those local currencies to buy the securities. And when it comes time to sell, the money has to be reconverted back into dollars.  In dollar terms, the EAFE index actually returned much more last year: 23.5 percent. That is because the dollar lost value against the euro. A weakening dollar is a tailwind for Americans investing abroad because each share of their foreign stock becomes worth that much more in dollars.  SO isn't this good news for domestic investors? It certainly was last year. But what happens if the dollar turns around this year and appreciates, as it did in 2005?  In that case, investors could see a big chunk of their foreign stock market gains evaporate -- even if the global stock markets are highly correlated -- simply because the dollar gained value.  This is one reason that investors should always assess several factors in the risk and return of a particular stock, said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in the investment counseling and research department at the Vanguard Group. These include its industry, its value or growth orientation, its market cap and the region where it operates.  ''While issues of style and cap size are always important, in many cases they would be secondary to geographic regions,'' Mr. Kinniry said, because stocks will always be affected by their regional economies and local currencies.  In other words, while geography may not be as important a subject as it used to be for investors, it is still one to be studied.  FUNDAMENTALLY Paul J.

                    "text": "  DEAR DIARY:  Walking hand in hand with Jordie, age 7, and Adam, age 5, Grandpa Fred was heard to say:  ''I'm sorry, boys. I told you, Grandpa doesn't go to see movies where the animals talk.''  Evelyn Malina  Dear Diary:  The other day I got off the Lexington Avenue subway train at 68th Street, and as I trudged up the steep flight of stairs toward the street exit, a black patent-leather high-heeled shoe tumbled down the steps and came to rest at my feet.  I looked up to see an attractive young woman hobbling back down the stairs, where she'd obviously come out of her shoe as she was ascending.  ''Just bought them today, and I knew I should have held out for the smaller size,'' she explained, red-faced.  I kneeled, picked up the shoe, and set it upright on the landing to allow her to slip her foot into it. As she did, I refrained from asking whether it would be a better fit for her wicked stepsisters.  Instead, I cautioned her, ''Be sure you get home before the clock strikes 12.''  Richard Curtis  Dear Diary:  When I arrived home and unpacked my purchases from Staples, I realized that an inexpensive calculator was missing from the bag. I immediately called the store and spoke with the manager, who actually located the calculator at the cash register station I had used.  ''I'll put it in a bag with your name on it'' he said. I gave him my name.  After a moment's silence I heard him say, sotto voce, ''Anybody got a pen? You got something to write with? I need a pen.''  Barry Levine  Dear Diary:  Exiting the subway at Wall Street, I was a little worried at an overheard conversation between a buttoned-down mom and her 5-ish-looking son:  Mom: ''not doing well in school? You need to do well in school, so that you can get into a good college''  Uh-oh, I thought, here comes the guilt trip.  Mom (continuing): ''so that you can become a professional football player.''  Oh. Nicely done, Mom.  Keith Herron  Dear Diary:  As I crossed Broadway above Columbus Circle during the morning rush, with a horde of fellow pedestrians on their way to work, I heard a horn blaring, emanating from an approaching white van.  The van was forced to stop as the group of commuters flocked across Broadway, paying no attention to the vehicle, which in fact had the right of way.  The screech of the horn continued for what seemed like an eternity, so I turned around to get a better look at the culprit. On the side of the van was a painted sign advertising the trade of the vehicle's occupant: Soundproof Window Installation.  Nothing like drumming up a little business whenever the opportunity arises.  Ian M. Waxman  Dear Diary:  While walking along Columbus Avenue, I had the distinct feeling that I was being followed by a large truck to my right.  I then heard my name being called, and there on the street was a fire truck with the driver calling out my name: ''Susan!''  It was a firefighter whom I have known for many years; he plays basketball at the 92nd Street Y, where I work.  As I approached the corner, the fire truck made a left turn, and all the firemen called out ''HELLO SUSAN'' while waving and teasing me. They all sounded like little girls saying hello!  It brought a lot of smiles to all the people around me.  Susan Grucci  Dear Diary:  Car, van and pedestrian traffic through the intersection at 53rd and Lexington during lunch hour is usually very heavy. I was crossing on the south side of the street, heading west.  As I reached the far corner, I noticed pedestrians watching a biker swing around a van that had just run a red light to take a parking space. He continued onto the sidewalk as the van's youngish driver opened his door and stepped down to the sidewalk.  The biker said in a surprisingly even voice, ''That was almost a really bad accident.'' The driver stared at the biker and said simply, ''I'm sorry.'' At that, the biker completed his circling of the van and headed north.  I was stunned. A peaceful exchange that may have made an impact on the van driver, not counting the many bystanders who may have expected a shouting match.  Good grief, I thought. What has this boisterous city come to?  Robert Swain  Metropolitan Diary  ",

                    "text": "  Rather than drifting through another big, bland blockbuster this week, why not focus on small shows? You can still see ''ART OF THE LEGA: MEANING AND METAPHOR IN CENTRAL AFRICA'' at AXA Gallery through Jan. 14. Lega men and women, from Congo, enter an initiation society at an early age to learn life skills and gain wisdom, and most Lega art is created as an instrument of moral teaching. The process of growth is complex and stimulating, on the evidence of the elegant sculptures and haunting masks here. 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 554-4818.  With a little traveling, you can piece together a mini-retrospective of the contemporary artist ELLSWORTH KELLY. In Chelsea all of Matthew Marks's galleries (at 522 West 22nd Street, 523 West 24th Street, 521 West 21st Street and 526 West 22nd Street) are devoted to him: two spaces with new abstract relief paintings, another with a single panoramic print, and yet another with a terrific series of shadow-derived notebook drawings from the 1950s that have much to say about the way this artist has related abstraction and the world. They are all on view through Jan. 27 (matthewmarks.com). Through February, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (philamuseum.org) has its own Kelly festival, notable for landmark pieces from his formative years in Paris.  Speaking of small surveys, one of the best, and most moving, shows of political art around is at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (through Feb. 25). ''DISSENT!'' brings together familiar pieces and rarely seen work. If all you know about Sister Corita (1918-86) is big strokes of abstract paint, check out the visually passionate topical prints here. Most interesting, though, are the relics of political activism at Harvard itself: a T-shirt with a raised-fist emblem was hand-printed in 1969 during a campus strike by design students. They worked around the clock, printing a political message on any object brought to them, for free. (617) 495-9400 or www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/fogg.  ",

                    "text": "  In a devastating condemnation of Consolidated Edison, state regulators have concluded that a failure to adequately maintain, operate and oversee its electrical network was ''the overriding cause'' of the nine-day blackout that paralyzed western Queens last July.  The regulators estimated that 174,000 people lost power in the blackout -- 70,000 more than was previously known. For the first three days of the blackout, Con Edison had insisted that no more than 8,000 people were affected.  In a 185-page draft report posted on its Web site last night, the staff of the New York State Public Service Commission concluded that the company had ''failed to fulfill its responsibilities'' under state law and recommended a formal proceeding that could result in large financial penalties against Con Edison.  The withering assessment and the prospect of hefty fines are all but certain to renew calls for the ouster of Con Edison's chairman and chief executive, Kevin M. Burke, who was widely blamed for failing to discern the magnitude of the blackout, which lasted from July 17 to 25, until three days after it started.  In its relentlessly critical language, the report sharply contradicts Con Edison's own 600-page report, released Oct. 12, which attributed the blackout to a series of events beyond its control, notably an underground fire, malfunctions in an electric breaker and a sudden surge of current.  The state report concludes instead that the primary cause of the blackout was ''the company's failure to address a multitude of pre-existing problems and issues associated with the operations, maintenance and oversight of the Long Island City network,'' which supplies power to about 460,000 people in western Queens.  The report suggests that the blackout lasted as long as it did because of Con Edison's ''failure to shut the network down in light of glaring evidence that the secondary system was experiencing severe damage'' in the early part of the blackout.  On the night of July 18, the second day of the event, top Con Edison managers contemplated shutting down the entire network, which would have caused an even wider blackout but would have caused less damage and been easier and faster to recover from.  Mr. Burke and other executives have since defended their decision not to shut down the network -- a decision that the new report suggests was a grave mistake.  Even as Con Edison's rank-and-file workers ''worked hard to contain the crisis,'' according to the report, ''the company's senior management failed or refused to comprehend the magnitude of the damage to its secondary system and the subsequent impact on customers.''  In a statement last night, a Con Edison spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin, said a controlled shutdown would have ''affected the lives of more than one million people, with no guarantee that power would have been restored any sooner.'' He added, ''We believed then, and still believe, that that would have been a worse situation.''  Mr. Clendenin said the utility was reviewing the report and ''will implement any actions necessary to reduce the likelihood of similar occurrences in the future.''  An analysis by The New York Times last summer, based on Con Edison documents, found that the Long Island City network had the most feeder-cable failures in 2004 and 2005 of any of the 57 networks. The analysis also found that several failures involved components that were 30 to 60 years old.  Con Edison said in response that the network was fine and among the top one-fourth of all underground networks in performance.  The new report rejected that argument. It stated that many of the network's components ''were not in conformance with the company's operating specifications.''  It added that Con Edison failed to understand the effects of load growth and transformer additions on the network. ''The size and complexity of the network,'' it said, ''outpaced the sophistication of the company's primary planning and contingency analysis tools.''  The report also found that that the utility's performance was ''particularly unacceptable'' when it came to communicating with the public.  Con Edison never gave a precise estimate of the number of people affected in the blackout. Its final rough guess was 25,000 customers -- a term that includes residential buildings and businesses and was said to translate to roughly 100,000 people. The new report found that the blackout affected 65,000 customers, or about 174,000 people.  The lack of a reliable estimate delayed Con Edison's response to the blackout and the arrival of emergency resources, according to the report, which called the absence of a system to properly assess damages and outages ''a major failing.''  Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat whose district included much of the area affected by the blackout, said the new report vindicated the utility's critics. ''Clearly, the fiction that Con Edison's decisions were correct has been exposed,'' he said.  Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat and the chairman of a committee that oversees the Public Service Commission, said the draft report should be accompanied by financial penalties. ''There's a lot of criticism, but no action,'' he said. ''That's not good enough.''  The commission's chairman at the time of the blackout, William M. Flynn, ordered the investigation on July 26, a day after the blackout ended. The commission held five days of hearings from August to November.  The staff originally intended to issue the draft report by Dec. 31. Con Edison and others may comment by Jan. 31. Then the commission will approve a final version.  In a related action, the commission yesterday approved the hiring of a consultant, Vantage Consulting of Cudjoe Key, Fla., to conduct an independent audit of Con Edison's electric emergency response program. Con Edison is to cover the cost of the work, which is not to exceed $800,800.  The commission ordered the audit in September and received seven proposals from consultants in November, before selecting Vantage.  ",

Peyton Manning can counter the Ravens' heralded defense by passing quickly from short drops or handing off to the rookie Joseph Addai. ''We never feel we can go anyplace and not move the ball,'' Colts Coach Tony Dungy said.  But the Ravens' offense has come a long way since Brian Billick fired Jim Fassel as offensive coordinator and took over himself. Steve McNair looks like the McNair of old.  The Colts have lost four straight games on the road, where Manning is 1-4 in playoff games. The Ravens have won four games in a row and 9 of their past 10.  Reporter's Pick: Ravens  Philadelphia (11-6)  at New Orleans (10-6)  8 p.m., Channel 5  The Eagles have the playoff experience and momentum. Most of the Saints have never been to the playoffs, but they have game-breakers on offense, a smart new coach in Sean Payton and a feel-good story.  The Eagles have won six in a row with Jeff Garcia at quarterback, and Brian Westbrook, with his elusive running, is no longer a hidden treasure. The offense must carry the Saints, and the weapons are there in quarterback Drew Brees, Reggie Bush, Deuce McAllister and receivers Joe Horn and Marques Colston.  The Eagles must contend without Lito Sheppard, the Pro Bowl cornerback who has a dislocated elbow. That makes the Saints' offense even more dangerous.  Reporter's Pick: Saints  Seattle (10-7)  at Chicago (13-3)  1 p.m., Channel 5  Both teams have problems at quarterback. When the Bears overwhelmed the Seahawks three months ago, they sacked Matt Hasselbeck five times and had two interceptions. Hasselbeck has 10 interceptions in his past 7 games.  Shaun Alexander's running has carried the load for the Seahawks, but as he said, ''Our offense has some things to do.'' So does the injury-riddled defense, but it may get unintended help from Rex Grossman, who had a passer rating of 0 in the Bears' season finale.  The Bears have been able to afford his bad days because they run well and their defense is good. But that defense is showing signs of weakness, yielding 300 or more yards in each of the past six games.  Reporter's Pick: Bears  New England (13-4)  at San Diego (14-2)  4:30 p.m., Channel 2  This could be the best game of the playoffs. The Chargers have been the league's strongest team and have the best record. The Patriots have won three Super Bowl titles in the past five years.  The Patriots have won seven of their past eight games and are 7-1 on the road. They will need a big game from quarterback Tom Brady to counter Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson, who led the league with 1,815 rushing yards and an N.F.L.-record 31 touchdowns.  ''We're usually looking at the back of his jersey,'' Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said. ''He's killed a lot of people besides us, and he's killed us.''  The Chargers have won 10 in a row and are playing at home, where they are 8-0.  Reporter's Pick: Chargers  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  FISH served with red wine has long stopped being a culinary faux pas. But for this pairing I wanted the fish to be in red wine, not just with it.  Just days after we tasted the alluring 2003 wines from St.-\u00c9milion, I was at a dinner party where bottles of fine Bordeaux were poured.  One of the dishes served with them was a classic matelote, prepared by Ronan Cardorel, who works for Daniel Boulud. A matelote is a stew in which eel is cooked in a wine sauce with fingerling potatoes, button mushrooms and bacon lardons. Though red wine fish dishes are served all over France, matelotes are typical of the southwest, near the Bordeaux region.  Then, dining at Alain Ducasse at the Essex House one night, the menu included a matelote of Thai snapper in red wine.  Shortly thereafter, at Gordon Ramsay at the London, line-caught turbot in St.-\u00c9milion sauce was on the menu. That clinched it. How could I resist the notion of pairing our earthy, complex 2003 St.-\u00c9milions with fish in red wine sauce?  I was surprised to find turbot in a couple of markets, both Canadian wild (fillets) and French farm-raised (whole). Neil Ferguson, Gordon Ramsay's chef de cuisine, said sea bass fillets would be a fine stand-in.  In reproducing the Ramsay recipe, I simplified it somewhat, leaving out the salsify that garnished the fish.  Nevertheless, the dish requires the full attention of the cook the whole time, with nothing suitable for advance preparation.  Though you do not have to use a St.-\u00c9milion for the sauce, a Bordeaux-style wine, especially one with a generous component of merlot, is particularly appropriate. The same goes for your choice to pour at the table.  Turbot Poached in St.-\u00c9milion  Adapted from Gordon Ramsay at the London  Time: 1 hour  8 medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, about 1 pound  Salt  7 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche  8 tablespoons unsalted butter, preferably high-fat European style, diced  Freshly ground black pepper  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  16 pearl onions, peeled  1 large shallot, finely chopped  2 cups St.-\u00c9milion or other dry red wine, preferably merlot  2 cups fish stock  1 pound turbot or sea bass fillets, skinned, in four pieces  1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves.  1.  Place potatoes in boiling salted water and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, peel and mash in a ricer. Return to pan, heat briefly and add 5 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and 1 1/2 tablespoons butter. Season with salt and pepper and set aside in pan, covered.  2.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet, add onions and saut\u00e9 over medium heat until lightly browned and tender. Set aside, covered.  3.  Heat remaining oil in a wide saucepan or a saut\u00e9 pan that can hold fish in a single layer. Add shallots and saut\u00e9 over low heat 5 minutes. Add wine and stock and bring to a simmer. Slip fish pieces into pan. Poach 3 to 4 minutes, until just firm. Remove fish, draining well. Place on a warm plate and cover to keep warm.  4.  Boil cooking liquid until reduced to about 1 cup. Whisk in remaining cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and season to taste with salt and pepper. Over low heat add remaining butter bit by bit, whisking it in. Sauce will thicken somewhat and turn glossy.  5.  Reheat potato pur\u00e9e and spoon into center of each of 4 dinner plates. Place a piece of fish on top and place onions around. Gently reheat sauce and spoon over each portion. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.  Yield: 4 servings.  PAIRINGS  ",

                    "text": "  North Carolina's attorney general said Saturday that his office would immediately assume control of the Duke lacrosse sexual assault case referred to him on Friday by the Durham County district attorney.  ''I wish I could tell you that this case would be resolved quickly,'' the attorney general, Roy A. Cooper, said at a news conference here on Saturday afternoon. ''Since we have not been involved in the investigation or the prosecution of these cases, all of the information will be new to our office. Any case with such serious criminal charges requires a careful and deliberate review.''  The district attorney, Michael B. Nifong, had asked Mr. Cooper to take over the prosecution, citing the conflict of interest he faced from having to respond to an ethics complaint from the North Carolina Bar Association. Mr. Nifong was ''very disappointed'' at giving up the case, his lawyer, David B. Freedman, said Saturday, but pleased with Mr. Cooper's assignment of two veteran prosecutors.  Defense lawyers and families of the defendants welcomed the news that the case would be in the hands of the attorney general's office.  ''We are taking a completely new, fresh look at this case, so anything could happen,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''We are looking at all the facts. Whatever charges, if any, are appropriate, they will be pursued.''  Mr. Cooper said his office would obtain the case files next week and then meet with defense lawyers and reinterview witnesses, including the accuser. He said he did not know if a pretrial hearing scheduled for Feb. 5 would have to be postponed.  Mr. Cooper, 49, a Democrat, is a former legislator who wrote a crime victim's bill of rights. He is serving his second term and has announced plans to run for re-election in 2008.  He assigned James J. Coman, head of the attorney general's Law Enforcement and Prosecutions Division, and Mary D. Winstead of the Special Prosecutions Division, to the case. But Mr. Cooper said he would make the final decisions in the case.  ''We accept the case with our eyes wide open to the evidence, but with blinders on for all other distractions,'' Mr. Cooper said.  From the start, the Duke case has been politically charged by race and class. A black woman hired to strip at a Duke lacrosse team party last March 13 accused three white students of gang rape. Protests erupted, and Mr. Nifong expressed with a certainty that a crime had occurred.  But in the last 10 months, his case floundered as defense lawyers offered time-stamped photographs challenging the stripper's account, prosecution reports highlighting the lack of DNA evidence and inconsistencies in the woman's story. Defense lawyers have insisted that the woman, 28, is a false accuser and have painted Mr. Nifong, 55, as a renegade with political motives.  Sexual offense and kidnapping charges are pending against Collin Finnerty, 20, of Garden City, N.Y.; Reade W. Seligmann, of Essex Fells, N.J.; and David F. Evans, 23, of Annapolis, Md. The three were initially charged with rape, but Mr. Nifong dismissed that charge after the accuser told an investigator she could not be sure what had penetrated her.  ",

                    "text": "  By the time Robbie Gould lined up for Sunday's game-winning field goal in overtime, some of his teammates were more nervous than he was.  ''I didn't want to watch it,'' Chicago Bears quarterback Rex Grossman said. ''I didn't see the hold or anything.''  What happened next sent Chicago into celebration. Thanks to Gould's 49-yard field goal, the longest in Bears postseason history, Chicago edged the Seattle Seahawks, 27-24, and will play host to the New Orleans Saints next Sunday for the National Football Conference championship.  Gould's kick, which came 4 minutes 58 seconds into overtime and equaled his career long, did more than just win a playoff game. It lifted a psychological burden from the Bears, who had been beaten at home during their previous two playoff appearances and had not won a playoff game since Jan. 1, 1995. Had the Bears lost this game, it would have cheapened their 13-3 regular season and their N.F.C. North title, sending them into another off-season feeling as if they had underachieved.  Instead, Chicago has a chance to reach the Super Bowl for the first time in 21 seasons. The Bears were far from dominant against the Seahawks, allowing running back Shaun Alexander to rush for 108 yards, and falling behind, 24-21, in the fourth quarter. But when it mattered, Gould delivered. He kicked a 41-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to tie the score, then followed with his game-winner.  The Bears mobbed Gould afterward, knowing that his kick had liberated them from heavy criticism.  ''We didn't play good the whole game, we played good enough to win,'' Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher said. ''It's like a monkey off our back. That was a good big kick -- bad field, 49 yards, windy. That's why he's first-team All-Pro.''  Gould has been a clutch performer for the Bears all season, making his first 24 field-goal attempts, and 32 of 36 over all during the regular season. On Dec. 17, Gould kicked a 25-yard field goal to defeat Tampa Bay in overtime.  Despite the pressure and the importance of Sunday's kick, he tried to treat it as routinely as possible.  ''It wasn't an easy kick, but you want the opportunity,'' said Gould, in his second season with the Bears since going undrafted out of Penn State.  ''This is obviously a big win for our team, keeping our season alive.''  For Chicago, it was a narrow escape. Gould's winning field goal completed the Bears' first possession in overtime, after Seattle won the overtime coin toss but stalled on its drive. Seahawks punter Ryan Plackemeier muffed a punt that traveled only 18 yards, giving the Bears a first down on their 34-yard line. Moments later, Grossman (21 for 38, 282 yards, one touchdown, one interception) completed a key 30-yard pass to Rashied Davis, and the Bears eventually drove to Seattle's 32, setting up Gould's winning kick.  The Bears will play in the conference championship game for the first time since the 1988 season.  Most of the pregame focus was on Grossman's inconsistent play all season, but this game was about all of the Bears. After last season's playoff loss, 29-21 to Carolina, the Bears came back strong, finishing with the best record in the conference. But another one-and-done playoff experience would have been more anguishing.  ''Last night I talked to the team about finishing,'' Bears Coach Lovie Smith said. ''Last year we were in this position, and we weren't able to finish the season the way we wanted. We talked about all we've gone through this year, how it would be a shame not to finish the game on a high note.''  The Seahawks did not go easily. Trailing by 21-14 at halftime, Seattle scored 10 consecutive points to take its first lead. After a 40-yard field goal by Josh Brown cut Seattle's deficit to 21-17, the Seahawks put together a seven-play, 51-yard touchdown drive. On third-and-10 from Chicago's 13-yard line, Alexander found a gaping hole in Chicago's defensive line and rumbled into the end zone, putting the Seahawks ahead, 24-21, with just under five minutes left in the third quarter.  One could almost hear the doubt creeping into Soldier Field when Seattle took the lead, but the Bears showed their resiliency. Grossman's pass was intercepted by Pete Hunter deep in Seattle's territory to end a drive early in the fourth quarter, but the Bears did not panic.  Chicago almost took the lead a few minutes later, but an apparent 66-yard punt return for a touchdown by Devin Hester was nullified because of an illegal block in the back. Once again, the Bears responded, driving 48 yards to Seattle's 23, setting up Gould's 41-yard field goal into the wind that barely sneaked over the crossbar with 4:24 left in regulation, tying the score.  The Seahawks had chances to win in regulation, but they were thwarted on their final two fourth-quarter possessions. Just after the two-minute warning, Seattle had fourth-and-1 from Chicago's 44. Seahawks Coach Mike Holmgren elected to go for the first down, but the play's timing was thrown off after Matt Hasselbeck bobbled the snap. When Alexander finally received the handoff from Hasselbeck, he was thrown for a 2-yard loss by linebacker Lance Briggs.  After stopping the Bears and getting the ball back, the Seahawks threatened again, driving from their 20 to Chicago's 45 with 30 seconds left in regulation. But Chicago defensive tackle Tank Johnson, who was arrested last month on misdemeanor weapons charges, sacked Hasselbeck for a 9-yard loss with 24 seconds to play in regulation.  ''We know what Tank is as a football player,'' Urlacher said. ''It was a big play.''  Time expired in regulation, and after the Bears stopped Seattle and got the ball in overtime, Grossman set up Gould's kick with his 30-yard completion to Davis.  ''The pattern was open all game,'' Davis said. ''Rex was waiting for a big play to come my way. I'm just elated.''  All the Bears were elated, because their season was still alive.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

I'd like to say a few words  In defense of our country  Whose people aren't bad nor are they mean  Now the leaders we have  While they're the worst that we've had  Are hardly the worst this poor world has seen  Let's turn history's pages, shall we?  Take the Caesars for example  Why within the first few of them  They had split Gaul into three parts  Fed the Christians to the lions  And burned down the City  And one of 'em  Appointed his own horse Consul of the Empire  That's like vice president or something  That's not a very good example, is it?  But wait, here's one, the Spanish Inquisition  They put people in a terrible position  I don't even like to think about it  Well, sometimes I like to think about it  Just a few words in defense of our country  Whose time at the top  Could be coming to an end  Now we don't want their love  And respect at this point is pretty much out of the question  But in times like these  We sure could use a friend  Hitler. Stalin.  Men who need no introduction  King Leopold of Belgium. That's right.  Everyone thinks he's so great  Well he owned The Congo  He tore it up too  He took the diamonds, he took the gold  He took the silver  Know what he left them with?  Malaria  A president once said,  ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself''  Now it seems like we're supposed to be afraid  It's patriotic in fact and color coded  And what are we supposed to be afraid of?  Why, of being afraid  That's what terror means, doesn't it?  That's what it used to mean  The end of an empire is messy at best  And this empire is ending  Like all the rest  Like the Spanish Armada adrift on the sea  We're adrift in the land of the brave  And the home of the free  Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.  ",

                    "text": "  Most bridge deals would cease to be interesting if everyone knew where all of the cards were located -- what is called playing double-dummy. If declarer could peek into his opponents' hands, he would almost always make his contract. But since he is not blessed with X-ray vision, sometimes the defenders can nudge declarer off the road to Rome and onto a dead end.  The diagramed deal, from the Swiss Teams at the Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional in Midtown Manhattan last Saturday, is one of those deals.  The winners were Franco Baseggio, John Diamond, Jim Krekorian and Andrew Stark of New York. The runners-up were John Fout, Michael Kopera and John Rengstorff of New York and William Ehlers of West Orange, N.J. Third were Rozanne and Bill Pollack of Basking Ridge, N.J.; Martin Fleisher of New York; and Michael Kamil of Holmdel, N.J.  What do you think of North's one-spade opening bid?  Distributional hands are worth much more than their face value if a fit is found. The drawback with opening this hand is the potential difficulty in showing both suits. If North had, for example, the majors, it would be much easier. Some would pass, planning to make a two-suited bid on the next round. And a few would open one club, but it is dangerous not to mention a five-card major immediately. If, for example, West bids hearts, North passes, and East raises to four hearts, this hand is not strong enough unilaterally to compete with four spades.  Both auctions were effectively the same, although at the other table Stark (North) rebid two hearts to show a normal two-spade rebid, and Baseggio (South) bid three no-trump over three clubs. West led the heart king, asking his partner either to unblock an honor or to give count. (This was dangerous without the heart ten. If East had played the queen from a three- or four-card suit, it might have sacrificed the setting trick.)  Here, though, East signaled an even number of hearts by playing his five. Now West shifted to a spade. Baseggio took the trick on the board and ran the diamond ten. West won with the queen and persevered with his second spade, but declarer won on the board and played a diamond to his jack. West, after winning with his king, cashed the heart ace, and South claimed the remainder. The defenders took two hearts and two diamonds.  Krekorian (West) led the heart ace, asking for an attitude signal. When Diamond (East) played a discouraging deuce, West wondered how East could gain the lead to push a heart through South's queen.  West shifted to the club queen, playing his partner for three to the jack.  The operation was a success, and the declarer did die, but he might have lived. If South had won with his club king and returned a club to dummy's ten, he would have made his contract. The defenders could have taken only three hearts and one club.  But declarer decided it was better to play on diamonds. He won the second trick with dummy's club ace, then ran the diamond ten. Now, with careful defense, the contract would always fail. West won with his diamond queen and led a second club to South's king. Declarer took his five spade tricks, but West kept the heart king, two diamonds and a club. South, sensing what was happening, played a diamond to his ace, hoping to drop the king, and conceded down one.  Plus 400 and plus 50 gave the winners 10 international match points on the board.

The attack occurred as Afghan laborers were lining up for security checks at the pedestrian entrance of the base known as Camp Salerno. The bomber was trying to enter the base, NATO said, but detonated the vest when he reached the search point.  Arsalah Jamal, the Afghan provincial governor of Khost, visited the scene after the bombing and confirmed the deaths of eight civilian laborers and two Afghan security guards, though a NATO statement put the toll at six Afghan civilians and two policemen.  ''I confirm 10 people, including two Afghan security guards, were killed in a suicide attack at the entrance of the military base,'' Mr. Jamal said.  He said 14 others had been wounded in the attack, all Afghan civilian daily workers for the military base. NATO said only five had been wounded.  Khost, in eastern Afghanistan, borders tribal areas in Pakistan that Afghan and Western officials contend offer a haven for militants organizing suicide attacks.  ''Suicide attack is not an Afghani phenomenon,'' Mr. Jamal said by telephone. ''There are madrasas and camps on the other side of the border where some elements promise passport and visa'' to ''young people for killing themselves and others.''  The attack was one of the deadliest since Sept. 30, 2006, when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the gates of the Interior Ministry in Kabul, killing 12 people and wounding up to 40.

You also claim that ''many charter schools do a superb job.'' Where is the evidence?  In most of Connecticut's charter schools, the percentage of students meeting targets on the Connecticut Mastery Test and Connecticut Academic Performance Test is below the state average -- sometimes well below. This evidence is consistent with the conclusions of studies conducted across this country -- that students in charter schools do no better than those in traditional public schools, on state tests and on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The one, admittedly limited, study finding promise in Connecticut's charter schools attributes a large part of this success precisely to the state's strict limits on expansion that you decry.  Where charter schools succeed in Connecticut, there is no evidence that ''educational innovation'' is at play, as you claim, rather than longer school hours, smaller schools and smaller class sizes than those in traditional public schools. These conditions have been long known to educators and parents to raise student achievement. They should be made available to all of our public school children, not just the select few who attend charter schools.

                    "text": "  LOW-INCOME residents of Connecticut towns, especially here in the northwest corner of the state, are finding it more and more difficult to afford the homes they've lived in for decades. A big part of the problem: property taxes.  Unlike New York, Connecticut has no county governments. As a result, its towns rely more heavily on property taxes than perhaps any others in the nation. This may be fine for New Yorkers who are wealthy enough to invest in weekend homes within driving range of Manhattan, but it creates a heavy financial burden on low-income families. This inequity could be greatly ameliorated if Connecticut were to adopt a resident homeowner tax exemption like those already in place in other states, including Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois and Georgia.  A homeowner tax exemption is usually a fixed amount that is deducted from the assessment of every eligible property before its real estate tax is set. The initial impact of a Connecticut town adopting a resident homeowner tax exemption would be to reduce the town's grand list, or tax base, by the total amount of the exemptions. Then, because exemptions don't reduce the town's budget, the property tax rate must be raised to cover town expenses unless the state provides aid to compensate the town for the exemptions.  An across-the-board homeowner exemption would lower the relative burden of property taxes on lower-valued properties. Because the owners of lower-valued properties also tend to have low incomes, much of the benefit from any homeowner tax exemption would flow to low-income homeowners.  The benefit can be enhanced by targeting the exemptions on residents with low incomes. This would be especially appropriate in Connecticut because the state's income tax law already provides a tax credit of up to $500 to anyone who pays at least that much in real estate taxes. To benefit from this credit, a taxpayer must owe at least as much income tax as the credit. But families with incomes below $24,000 are exempt from income taxes, and thus get no benefit from the state's property tax credit. A targeted homeowner tax exemption would help compensate for this omission.  Before Connecticut towns could adopt a resident homeowner tax exemption, the State Legislature would have to enact enabling legislation. There are many forms that such legislation might take, but the most feasible would be a law that allowed ''home rule,'' which essentially allows localities discretion in whether to accept a homeowner tax exemption. Thus, a town could offer a homeowner tax exemption only if its residents voted to do so.  How would a homeowner tax exemption work in Connecticut? As a test, I calculated how it might apply to Cornwall, the small rural town where I live. I used data from the town's grand list and the mill rate, which is the property tax rate voted on by the town's finance board to support the town budget. Cornwall has about 800 dwellings, about 600 occupied on a year-round basis and the others by weekenders. I assumed that a homeowner tax exemption of $50,000 would be targeted so as to apply only to the 150 lowest-assessed properties occupied year-round.  The exemption would cut the annual property tax on the median of these lowest-assessed properties in half, from just over $2,000 to about $1,000. It would cost the state about $150,000 to provide financial aid to Cornwall to compensate for the benefit. However, if state aid was not forthcoming, the town would have to distribute the cost of the exemption among all taxpayers, which would mean a 3 percent increase in taxes.  Cornwall has a property tax rate that is among the lowest in Connecticut (just over 21 mills, or about 2 percent of the assessment). It also has a substantial number of generally well-off weekend and year-round residents who would probably not strongly oppose a 3 percent increase in their taxes. Cornwall is a fairly typical town for the northwest corner of Litchfield County, but other towns in the state might not choose to adopt a homeowner tax exemption, or might adopt it in a less targeted form -- that's why home rule is essential.  Inevitably, rural towns across Connecticut are going to continue to rely heavily on property taxes to meet their budget needs, and as a result low-income families are going to continue to suffer. Giving the towns some independence by allowing them to implement a targeted homeowner tax exemption would help make rural towns more affordable for their more hard-pressed residents.

You can still see ''ART OF THE LEGA: MEANING AND METAPHOR IN CENTRAL AFRICA'' at AXA Gallery through Jan. 14. Lega men and women, from Congo, enter an initiation society at an early age to learn life skills and gain wisdom, and most Lega art is created as an instrument of moral teaching. The process of growth is complex and stimulating, on the evidence of the elegant sculptures and haunting masks here. 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 554-4818.  With a little traveling, you can piece together a mini-retrospective of the contemporary artist ELLSWORTH KELLY. In Chelsea all of Matthew Marks's galleries (at 522 West 22nd Street, 523 West 24th Street, 521 West 21st Street and 526 West 22nd Street) are devoted to him: two spaces with new abstract relief paintings, another with a single panoramic print, and yet another with a terrific series of shadow-derived notebook drawings from the 1950s that have much to say about the way this artist has related abstraction and the world. They are all on view through Jan. 27 (matthewmarks.com). Through February, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (philamuseum.org) has its own Kelly festival, notable for landmark pieces from his formative years in Paris.  Speaking of small surveys, one of the best, and most moving, shows of political art around is at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (through Feb. 25). ''DISSENT!'' brings together familiar pieces and rarely seen work. If all you know about Sister Corita (1918-86) is big strokes of abstract paint, check out the visually passionate topical prints here. Most interesting, though, are the relics of political activism at Harvard itself: a T-shirt with a raised-fist emblem was hand-printed in 1969 during a campus strike by design students. They worked around the clock, printing a political message on any object brought to them, for free. (617) 495-9400 or www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/fogg.  ",

They are small and versatile backs, and whoever has the better game will most likely be headed to the next round of the playoffs -- unless they cancel each other out, as they have done twice this season. The Eagles have the 26th-ranked rush defense, but held Barber to 126 yards on 40 carries in two meetings. The Giants, under their new play-caller, Kevin Gilbride, have vowed to be more committed to the run. While Eli Manning has played relatively well against the Eagles, and quarterback Jeff Garcia has sparked the Eagles' five-game winning streak, each team would like to put its chances in the hands of its ball carriers.  BY THE NUMBERS, GIANTS vs. EAGLES  3.15  Average gain per rush by Giants running back Tiki Barber in two games against the Eagles. In 14 other games, Barber averaged 5.4 yards a carry.  8  Sacks of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by the Eagles on Sept. 17. He was not sacked more than twice in any other game, including the Dec. 17 rematch, when he was sacked once.  23  Points scored by the Giants in the fourth quarter and overtime on Sept. 17 to overcome a 24-7 fourth-quarter deficit.  22  Points scored by the Eagles in the fourth quarter on Dec. 17, leading to a 36-22 victory.

This is particularly onerous for many retirees who frequently pay some 20 percent of their pension and Social Security income for property taxes, yet on the block where they live, a wealthier person with the same property assessment may pay only 5 percent of his income for property taxes.  Property taxes are regressive in that payments reflect property values rather than income, thus favoring the wealthy over the middle class and poor.  Reform will not occur through plans to reduce benefits for state employees because the prospect of labor unrest and political retribution in an election year will surely deter legislators from provoking a significant part of the electorate.  The fair and appropriate way to achieve property tax reform is to require those with the highest incomes to pay a higher state income tax and use that money to substantially finance education while reducing property taxes.

                    "text": "  TWO weeks ago, President Bush called for a long-term plan to increase the size of the armed forces. As our leaders consider various options for carrying out Mr. Bush's vision, one issue likely to generate fierce debate is ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the policy that bars openly gay service members from the military. Indeed, leaders in the new Congress are planning to re-introduce a bill to repeal the policy next year.  As was the case in 1993 -- the last time the American people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly gay men and lesbians should serve in the military -- the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides. The debate must be conducted with sensitivity, but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14 years.  When I was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I supported the current policy because I believed that implementing a change in the rules at that time would have been too burdensome for our troops and commanders. I still believe that to have been true. The concern among many in the military was that given the longstanding view that homosexuality was incompatible with service, letting people who were openly gay serve would lower morale, harm recruitment and undermine unit cohesion.  In the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve. President Bill Clinton, who promised to lift the ban during his campaign, was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition, which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take. The compromise that came to be known as ''don't ask, don't tell'' was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve.  The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much evidence suggests that it has.  Last year I held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines, including some with combat experience in Iraq, and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew. These conversations showed me just how much the military has changed, and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers.  This perception is supported by a new Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people. And 24 foreign nations, including Israel, Britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism, let gays serve openly, with none reporting morale or recruitment problems.  I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces. Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.  But if America is ready for a military policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, the timing of the change should be carefully considered. As the 110th Congress opens for business, some of its most urgent priorities, like developing a more effective strategy in Iraq, share widespread support that spans political affiliations. Addressing such issues could help heal the divisions that cleave our country. Fighting early in this Congress to lift the ban on openly gay service members is not likely to add to that healing, and it risks alienating people whose support is needed to get this country on the right track.  By taking a measured, prudent approach to change, political and military leaders can focus on solving the nation's most pressing problems while remaining genuinely open to the eventual and inevitable lifting of the ban. When that day comes, gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are, and the military will no longer need to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose.  Op-Ed Contributor John M. Shalikashvili, a retired army general, was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997.  ",

                    "text": "  A new study suggests that having many siblings may increase the risk for certain stomach cancers and that younger siblings may be more at risk than older ones.  Researchers gathered blood samples from 7,429 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii from 1967 to 1975 to determine whether they were infected with Helicobacter pylori, a childhood infection known to increase the risk for stomach cancer much later in life. They followed the men for 28 years, during which 261 developed gastric cancer.  From that group, the researchers selected the cases of those infected with H. pylori -- 239, or 92 percent -- and compared them with a group of cancer-free, but also infected, controls. The team then looked at family size and birth order in both groups.  Among the cases with the most the virulent strain of H. pylori, called cagA, those from families with seven or more children were more than twice as likely to develop cancer as those from families with one to three children, and younger children had a higher risk than older ones.  The study appears in the January issue of PloS Medicine.  ''It's remarkable that something that's happening in the early years of life affects the risk of a cancer happening seven decades later,'' said Dr. Martin J. Blaser, the lead author and a professor of medicine at New York University. ''It's my hypothesis that this may be a model system for other cancers.''  The authors acknowledge that some factor other than family size or birth order may be the cause of the findings. But they suggest that the germ is transmitted among siblings, and that the immature immune systems of younger children may make them more susceptible.  VITAL SIGNS: AT RISK  ",

The so-called Saatchi 17 quit Saatchi & Saatchi en masse in February 2005, three days after their boss, Michael Burns, the former worldwide director of the General Mills account, left the agency.  The employees were all hired by Interpublic, which denied it was hoping that General Mills would follow them to One Seven. Although General Mills never hired One Seven, the agency landed accounts from marketers like ConAgra and Gorton's. Mr. Burns joined One Seven as chairman after the settlement last July of a lawsuit brought against him by Saatchi & Saatchi, which claimed he had arranged the simultaneous departures of the employees.  Interpublic, in a statement Friday, said it would try to find jobs at other Interpublic agencies for some One Seven employees, adding that others were planning to open agencies of their own.

                    "text": "  Gov. Eliot Spitzer vowed yesterday to make health insurance available to all children and enroll all eligible adults in Medicaid. If carried out fully, his pledges would cut the number of uninsured New Yorkers in half.  But those promises may not turn out to be as ambitious as described. How far they go will depend on details the governor and his staff said would not be made public until late this month.  At their most far-reaching, the governor's plans would give New York the lowest percentage of uninsured people in the country, and would mark a sharp increase in coverage for the poor. Even so, such promises would not be as hard or as expensive to carry out as most people would guess, according to people who study the politics and economics of health care.  People who have no health insurance tend to be young and healthy, cheaper to care for and cheaper to cover than those who are currently covered. As a result, the United Hospital Fund, a policy research group, has estimated that covering all of the uninsured in New York would cost $4.1 billion a year -- less than one-tenth of what the state already spends on Medicaid, the health plan for the poor. Most of the uninsured are also poor, and already qualify for Medicaid or a similar program, Child Health Plus, so experts said that easier enrollment and more aggressive recruitment in those programs would almost certainly be at the center of Mr. Spitzer's plans.  The biggest obstacle, they said, could be new federal requirements that people signing up for Medicaid produce birth certificates or other proof of citizenship.  In his first address to the Legislature, Mr. Spitzer said, ''We will introduce a budget that in the very first year, guarantees access to health insurance for all of New York's 500,000 uninsured children.''  But to guarantee access to insurance and to guarantee actual coverage could be two very different things. Many people have access to government programs, at least in theory, but do not take advantage of them. Again, the governor did not say precisely what he meant by his promise.  In New York, children qualify for free health insurance through either Medicaid or Child Health Plus, in households that earn up to 160 percent of the federal poverty line -- about $21,000 a year for a family of four. Above that limit, up to 250 percent of the poverty line -- about $33,000 for a family of four -- they are eligible for Child Health Plus for a premium of $15 a month or less.  About two-thirds of New York's uninsured children already qualify for one of the programs on those terms. Danielle Holahan, senior health policy analyst at the United Hospital Fund, said, ''That, plus the fact that children are pretty cheap to insure,'' suggests that getting most of them enrolled ''is something we could tackle pretty easily.''  State law also says that any child, no matter how high the family income, can be enrolled in Child Health Plus by paying a premium that averages less than $200 a month, much less than a commercial insurance policy. Officials in the Pataki administration argued that that means New York already guarantees access to coverage for all children.  Ms. Holahan said the state could draw middle-income children into Child Health Plus by putting the premiums on a sliding scale as incomes rise, rather than having an abrupt jump up from $15 a month.  Mr. Spitzer said that within four years, ''we will enroll the 900,000 Medicaid-eligible adults'' by simplifying the paperwork.  That promise could be tougher to keep, experts said, because he is promising not mere access but actual coverage. Each year, about one-third of the people on Medicaid in New York fail to renew their enrollment, though they remain eligible, so policy analysts say that an easier renewal process would keep some people enrolled. They also proposed tying Medicaid enrollment to food stamps, welfare, schools and other public services.  But some people are reluctant to sign up, particularly immigrants who mistrust the government or just cannot be bothered.  ''The only way you ever get to really universal coverage is with some sort of individual mandate requiring people to enroll,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.  Almost 14 percent of New Yorkers are uninsured, according to the Census Bureau, below the national average of nearly 16 percent but well above Minnesota, with the lowest rate, less than 9 percent. If Mr. Spitzer succeeds in insuring all children and all people eligible for Medicaid, the number of uninsured in New York would drop below 7 percent.  Medicaid spends more than $45 billion a year to insure 4.2 million New Yorkers, but most of those costs are spent on older and disabled patients.  An estimated 1.2 million people qualify for Medicaid or Child Health Plus but are not enrolled. They are disproportionately healthy young adults and children.  ''Low-income people who have serious health needs end up in a hospital emergency room, and they enroll in Medicaid at that time, if they're not enrolled already,'' Ms. Rowland said. ''So the remaining uninsured tend to be healthier than those who are insured.''  CHANGEOVER IN ALBANY  ",

                    "text": "  If you would like to start with a test, look only at the West hand in the diagramed deal and the auction. What would you lead against six hearts?  After you have decided, study all four hands and see if you can guess how South failed to make six hearts without doing anything unreasonable.  There are days when we can seem to do no wrong. Athletes say that they are in the zone. Zia Mahmood calls it being in Heat 1 (out of 3) at the bridge table. It happens rarely, but when it does, it is thrilling.  This deal was played six days ago at Thebridgeplace in Lake Park, Fla., and was sent in by the ''victim,'' Claire Tornay (South) of Palm Beach Gardens. She opened two clubs, strong, artificial and forcing. North responded two diamonds, which normally shows 0-7 points but might be stronger when having no good long suit to bid. North's four-heart rebid was incorrect. Her hand should contain at least four-card heart support but no first- or second-round control -- no ace, void, king or singleton. (North should have bid three hearts.) South, hoping her partner would table a black-suit queen or doubleton, jumped to six hearts.  Sitting West was Harold Rosenson of West Palm Beach, who was at least momentarily in Heat 1. His opening lead was the heart five; what adjective would you apply?  South won East's ten with her king and cashed the heart ace, being shocked to see the queen fall on her left. To make the contract now, declarer had to guess that East held the queen and ten of spades. Being in Heat 2, though, she did not do that, playing off the ace and king of spades. When West discarded, South played a heart to dummy's jack and ran the club nine through East. West won with his queen and returned a club, leaving declarer with a spade loser. Down one gave East-West 11 match points out of 12.  Rosenson was unlucky that declarer had no fast dummy entry; otherwise he surely would have taken a trump trick. But he had avoided giving away a trick. Notice that South would have had an easy time after any other lead. She would ruff the diamond ace and have a discard for her spade loser on dummy's diamond king. A club would be away from the queen, and South would lose only one spade. And if West selected his singleton spade, declarer would pick up that suit successfully.  Rosenson and his partner, Ellen Kaye Miller of Highland Park, Ill., had a creditable 61.2 percent game, but that was good enough only for second, 11.4 percentage points behind Deborah Drury of Vero Beach and Gail Nye of Palm City.

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  In ''Legislature: Learn to Say No'' (editorial, Dec. 31), you advocate the ''simple step'' of raising the restriction on charter school enrollment to ease the burden of education costs on localities. You also claim that ''many charter schools do a superb job.'' Where is the evidence?  In most of Connecticut's charter schools, the percentage of students meeting targets on the Connecticut Mastery Test and Connecticut Academic Performance Test is below the state average -- sometimes well below. This evidence is consistent with the conclusions of studies conducted across this country -- that students in charter schools do no better than those in traditional public schools, on state tests and on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The one, admittedly limited, study finding promise in Connecticut's charter schools attributes a large part of this success precisely to the state's strict limits on expansion that you decry.  Where charter schools succeed in Connecticut, there is no evidence that ''educational innovation'' is at play, as you claim, rather than longer school hours, smaller schools and smaller class sizes than those in traditional public schools. These conditions have been long known to educators and parents to raise student achievement. They should be made available to all of our public school children, not just the select few who attend charter schools.

                    "text": "  Four men, their backs to the audience, stand in a line upstage at the beginning of George Balanchine's ''Agon.'' Then they turn, and Stravinsky's bright fanfare of trumpets heralds the start of the ballet that, in Balanchine's words, used history as ''the takeoff point.''  Stravinsky used a French Baroque dance manual as the basis for his score; Balanchine deployed the academic vocabulary of classical ballet. And yet dance history was changed by ''Agon,'' with its angular, tensile movements that perfectly matched the composer's astringent forays into 12-tone technique.  Audiences must have been hardly able to register visually the compressed, unconventional movement when the ballet had its premiere in 1957; even today the choreography, with its unexpected transitions and acrobatic tension, can surprise, and in the best performances always does.  One of those performances came from an almost all-new cast at the New York City Ballet on Thursday night, when ''Agon'' was danced with a uniformly spiky intensity and a sensitivity to the rhythmic interplay between the music and the movement. Andrew Veyette gave a lovely sinuousness to his ''Sarabande'' solo, and Ellen Bar was coolly seductive in her ''Bransle Gay'' solo and the subsequent pas de trois, balancing unworriedly in arabesque as her two partners switched sides.  But it was Maria Kowroski, more familiar with her part, who electrified the whole work in the pas de deux that is at its heart. With her long, hyper-flexible limbs, Ms. Kowroski can sometimes look unanchored in space, but here every movement was diamond sharp and dazzling. S\u00e9bastien Marcovici, making his debut, partnered with subtlety and skill.  Another explosive performance came at the end of the evening, from Sterling Hyltin, new to her role in ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' and just as riveting. Ms. Hyltin came flying onto the stage with huge, traveling jumps -- Balanchine's jazzy knees-together surprise opener to another major Stravinsky score -- and she often looked as if she might rocket offstage. In a good way.  Amar Ramasar, new to the cryptic yet poignant central pas de deux, worked well with Jennie Somogyi -- curiously sluggish in her solo sections -- and nicely conveyed the wit and humor within the ballet's jagged, lighting-bolt aesthetic.  Also on the all-Stravinsky-Balanchine program was ''Monumentum Pro Gesualdo'' and ''Movements for Piano and Orchestra,'' both authoritatively headed by Charles Askegard and Rebecca Krohn; and ''Duo Concertant,'' in which Nikolaj Hubbe, partnering Yvonne Borree, was a spirited delight.  The orchestra, conducted by Fay\u00e7al Karoui, occasionally sounded patchy, but gave ''Symphony in Three Movements'' a fine, propulsive performance.  The New York City Ballet performs through Feb. 25 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 870-5570, nycballet.org. ''Stravinsky and Balanchine: An Eternal Partnership'' will be performed again tomorrow.  DANCE REVIEW  ",

                    "text": "  Thrift is often the best catalyst for culinary invention. Penny-pinching dishes like panzanella, poule au pot and beef rag\u00f9 were all responses of wily cooks to hard times. Likewise, the recipe for these pork chops with rye-bread stuffing, which The Times published in 1959, was billed as a dinner on the cheap. Pork chops are an inexpensive cut of meat, and bread stuffing was used, as it has been for hundreds of years, to stretch the portions.  Using rye bread, with its strong grain flavor, and seasoning it with saut\u00e9ed onion, garlic, parsley and caraway, give the stuffing distinction far beyond its means. From here the technique is pure 1950s: the chops are browned in the oven, and a sauce is made with the brown but succulent drippings. The result is very ... brown. But toothsome -- like a better-dressed cousin of pastrami on rye.  Nowadays supermarket pork chops have become so thin and industrially produced that they yield a dish with the texture of particle board. It's worth the effort to find a butcher who carries good, fat-marbled chops and who can cut them thickly -- an inch is best. (Also, I've reworked the recipe a bit, cooking the meat covered in the oven to keep it moist, then finishing it under the broiler.)  I gave the recipe to Marco Canora, the chef at Hearth in New York, to try, and he was surprised by how much he liked the pork chops. ''I'm not just saying this,'' he added. ''They were delicious.''  When Canora modernized the recipe, he turned to an even cheaper cut: pork belly. First he brined it, then braised it in a combination of thick, cloudy apple cider and stock infused with garlic, thyme and caraway. ''I've always liked cabbage with pork,'' he said, so he also braised a little red cabbage with apple, mustard seeds, cider vinegar and more caraway. The finished dish -- a square of meat and a tangle of wilted red cabbage shored up with braising juices (pink on red on brown) -- is an intoxicating blend of pork, caraway and cider vinegar. It's pastrami on rye's urbane, wholesome cousin.  On first read, Canora's recipe is cheflike and daunting. But while its steps stretch over three days -- brining, braising, finishing -- the total amount of work involved is little more than that for the pork chops. Still skeptical? The night Canora put the dish on his menu, it sold out in half an hour.  1959: Pork Chops With Rye-Bread Stuffing  This recipe appeared in The Times in an article by Craig Claiborne.  6 bone-in, 1-inch-thick loin chops  3 tablespoons butter  1 medium onion, finely chopped  1 large clove garlic, minced  3 1/2 cups soft rye-bread crumbs  (a mix of large and small pieces, without caraway seeds)  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds  3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley  Salt and pepper  1 large egg, lightly beaten with 3 tablespoons water  1 tablespoon flour  3/4 cup chicken broth.  1. Have a butcher cut a generous pocket in each chop or a slit to butterfly the chops for stuffing.  2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a saut\u00e9 pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a large bowl and add the bread crumbs, caraway seeds, parsley, teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Add the beaten egg and mix with a fork until blended.  3. Fill the chops with the stuffing, then seal the pockets with toothpicks. Season on all sides with salt and pepper. Arrange in a braising pan or other shallow baking dish fitted with a lid. Bake, covered, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, not the stuffing, reaches 155 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes.  4. Remove the lid and place the pan under the broiler just until the chops are browned and the temperature in the thickest part of the meat is 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm.  5. Set the braising pan on the stove over medium heat and reduce the pan juices to a thick glaze. Add the remaining tablespoon butter. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer, scraping up the pan drippings, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; strain. Season to taste. Serve the pork chops with the sauce. Serves 6.  Brined-and-Braised Pork Belly With Caraway  By Marco Canora, the chef and co-owner of Hearth  For the brine:  1 cup caraway seeds  3 tablespoons fennel seeds  3 tablespoons whole black peppercorns  3 tablespoons coriander seeds  1 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more as needed  1 cup packed dark brown sugar  6 cloves garlic, crushed  2 cups cider vinegar  2 pounds pork belly (center cut)  For the braise:  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons canola oil  1 carrot, chopped  1 stalk celery, chopped  1 onion, chopped  4 cloves garlic, crushed  6 sprigs thyme  3 tablespoons caraway seeds, toasted  4 cups apple cider  4 cups chicken broth.  1. Two days before serving the pork, prepare the brine: In a large skillet over low heat, toast the caraway seeds. Cool and grind in a spice grinder. In a large plastic container, combine the caraway, fennel, peppercorns, coriander, salt, brown sugar, garlic, cider vinegar and 4 cups water. Add the pork, cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.  2. The next day, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Remove the pork from the brine and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper. In a braising pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the pork and brown on all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add the carrot, celery, onion, garlic, thyme and 2 tablespoons toasted caraway seeds to the pan. Brown the vegetables until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return the pork to the pan, skin side up. Pour in the apple cider and enough broth to cover the meat by three-fourths. Bring to a boil, then cover and braise in the oven until the pork is very tender, about 2 hours. Cool the pork in its cooking liquid and refrigerate overnight.  3. The next day, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Scrape off and discard excess fat from the braising liquid. Remove the pork and discard loose gelatin. Cut the pork into serving pieces and place in a wide saut\u00e9 pan with a heatproof handle. Bring the braising liquid to a boil and reduce by about two-thirds, or until it lightly coats the back of a spoon; strain. Pour just enough liquid over the pork to submerge halfway. Sprinkle with the remaining caraway seeds, then place the pan in the oven and heat through, basting occasionally. Top pork with sauce and serve with braised cabbage, a recipe for which can be found at nytimes.com/magazine. Serves 4.  ",

                    "text": "  Jerome Robbins choreographed two of his late ballets to Bach in the first few months of 1994, and both were on the third themed program of the New York City Ballet's winter season, ''Jerome Robbins: An American Icon.''  In a sense, the two pieces are very different: ''2 & 3 Part Inventions'' is an ensemble, created for teenage students at the School of American Ballet; ''A Suite of Dances'' is a solo for Mikhail Baryshnikov, then in his 40s. But both works capture the radiance of spirit and the translucent purity of intention of thoroughbred bodies dedicated to joyous motion.  In ''2 & 3 Part Inventions,'' set to some of the piano exercises Bach wrote for one of his young sons, Mr. Robbins provides an effect of simplicity and playfulness. His choreography is studded with unusual rhythmic dynamics and inconspicuous technical difficulties throughout the 12 sections. And although there are solos and pas de deux, the emphasis is on counterpoint and canon within the group.  On Sunday afternoon the dancers -- Rebecca Krohn, Tyler Angle, Sterling Hyltin, Tiler Peck, Ana Sophia Scheller, Jonathan Stafford, Amar Ramasar and Seth Orza -- paid tribute to Robbins's famous perfectionism with an impeccably polished and charming performance. The equally fine pianist was Nancy McDill, who had played at this work's premiere.  Damian Woetzel was no less charming in ''A Suite of Dances,'' performed to excerpts from Bach's Suites for Solo Cello, played onstage by Ann Kim. The beginning is tentative and inward-looking, as Mr. Woetzel sketches out the steps. By the end, however, he is flirting with the audience, spinning through bravura pirouette sequences and finally cartwheeling into place at the cellist's feet. Mr. Woetzel often seems hesitant about being a star, but there was no doubt about it here.  A young girl doomed to an untimely death is the theme of ''In Memory of ,'' to Berg's Violin Concerto from 1935, beautifully played by Kurt Nikkanen. The ballet can feel formulaic, but Wendy Whelan, tenderly partnered by Seth Orza and threatened by a subtly menacing Charles Askegard, was quietly luminous in the central role.  ''I'm Old Fashioned,'' to a score by Morton Gould, based on a theme by Jerome Kern, is an unabashed crowd pleaser that is also a serious ballet, perhaps a little too serious, as Robbins dissects the lovely duet by Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth, shown on film as the ballet begins, at considerable length.  But Ms. Krohn, Maria Kowroski and Jenifer Ringer, partnered by Mr. Angle, Philip Neal and Stephen Hanna, were just as glamorous as they needed to be, and the showstopping finale -- a plethora of Astaires and Hayworths dancing beneath the film -- is sigh-worthy pleasure. Maurice Kaplow led the orchestra, in fine form.  The New York City Ballet performs through Feb. 25 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com. ''Jerome Robbins: An American Icon'' will be performed again tomorrow night.  DANCE REVIEW  ",

                    "text": "  WHEN Republican leaders meeting in Albany on Nov. 30 named Joseph N. Mondello their state chairman on the heels of an election in which Republicans took a historic drubbing, Mr. Mondello, in a flash of candor, said he was taking over a party that had hit rock bottom.  ''We've got almost no place further down that we can go,'' Mr. Mondello, the longtime Nassau Republican chairman, said in an interview that day.  Now, a little more than a month but a political eternity later, it appears Mr. Mondello may have spoken too soon.  Never mind that Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate leader and, with the end of the Pataki era, the most powerful Republican in the state, has since disclosed that he is under federal investigation for his outside consulting work.  With a new Democratic governor, Eliot Spitzer, reaching across party lines in late December to name a Republican, State Senator Michael A. L. Balboni of East Williston, to head up homeland security, Mr. Mondello is abruptly facing a bruising special election in his home base to fill Mr. Balboni's seat. Mr. Spitzer will set the date for the election, probably for early to mid-February.  If a Democrat wins the northwestern Nassau district, where Democrats hold a slight registration edge, it would be a major embarrassment for Mr. Mondello, the first chipping away of the Republican grip on all nine State Senate seats for Long Island. It would also further narrow the slender majority Republicans hold in the Senate.  But if a Republican wins, Mr. Mondello would gain luster. And if Mr. Bruno, who chose Mr. Mondello for state chairman, were forced out, Mr. Mondello has close ties to the heir apparent, State Senator Dean G. Skelos, of Rockville Centre.  Anthony Santino, a spokesman for Mr. Mondello, said last week that no decision had been made on a candidate. But Mr. Mondello's widely expected choice is Maureen O'Connell, 56, of East Williston, a former registered nurse and lawyer who served in the State Assembly from 1999 to last January, when she took over as Nassau County clerk.  Ms. O'Connell did not answer calls to her office. Mr. Santino said Mr. Mondello was unavailable. ''We're certainly going to wage a very aggressive campaign to keep the seat Republican,'' Mr. Santino said.  Jay S. Jacobs, the Nassau Democratic chairman, said Mr. Spitzer's landslide election on a reform platform gave local Democrats momentum. He said federal scrutiny of Mr. Bruno would be an issue. ''Joe Mondello was handpicked by Joseph Bruno, so you do the math,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''Their candidate would be critical of Bruno at his or her peril.''  Craig M. Johnson, 33, of Port Washington, who is a third-term Nassau County legislator and whose district is within the senatorial district, was seen as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination.  Mr. Johnson, a lawyer with a practice in bankruptcy and commercial law, earned notice in March when he endorsed Mr. Spitzer for governor at a time when Nassau's top Democratic official, County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, was seeking the office. Mr. Johnson declined to comment last week on his candidacy.  Other leading candidates are Michelle Schimel, the North Hempstead town clerk, and Matthew Cuomo, a cousin of State Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo and nephew of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Nassau County Legislator Roger H. Corbin and Rocco Iannarelli, the North Hempstead tax receiver, were also on the list. State Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli of Great Neck could also emerge as a candidate unless Mr. Spitzer names him to succeed State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned last month in an ethics scandal involving misuse of state money to chauffeur his wife.  Desmond Ryan, a veteran political lobbyist, said Mr. Spitzer's reform initiatives and Mr. Bruno's legal situation played strongly to the advantage of the Democrats. ''Their candidate will be able to say, 'Elect me and I will help you reform state government,' '' he said. He added that Long Island Republicans ''never do well in special elections.''

                    "text": "  THE flow of earnings reports will pick up this week, but the earnings themselves are expected to show a dip in growth from past quarters. Any impact on share prices may depend on investors' expectations about those expectations.  Standard & Poor's estimates that earnings for companies in its 500-stock index rose by 9 percent, year over year, in the fourth quarter. That would be a healthy gain, but also the worst one in nearly five years, said Sam Stovall, S.& P.'s chief investment strategist.  ''This would be the first quarter in 19 where we've had a single-digit advance,'' he said.  But it has not been 19 quarters, or even two, since analysts last forecast single-digit growth.  Earnings estimates started off low for just about every quarter during the four-year bull market and then nudged up continually as fresh numbers came in. S.& P.'s forecast is close to those of other research firms, Mr. Stovall noted, but investors may still be disappointed if results meet expectations and nothing more.  ''Earnings are not going to grow at double digits forever,'' he said. ''The real question is: Is Wall Street prepared for the first single-digit advance in 19 quarters?''  One of the first big-name companies to report is Alcoa, which Mr. Stovall likened to a corporate Iowa for its status as a periodic bellwether.  S.& P. projects 150 percent earnings growth for aluminum producers, of which Alcoa is the biggest, and a result in that neighborhood on Tuesday would augur well for fourth-quarter earnings generally, and for 2007 economic activity, he said.  No triple-digit, or even double-digit, gain is foreseen for smaller companies. After increasing earnings at an annual rate of 17 percent or more in each quarter of last year, the S.& P. 600 index of smaller companies is expected to show growth of just 5 percent for the last quarter.  The gap in earnings growth is just one reason that Mr. Stovall expects investors to find larger companies more appealing than smaller ones this year. Smaller companies' run of outperformance is looking long in the tooth after seven years, he said, and indications of softening economic conditions could steer investors toward the comparative safety that blue chips are thought to offer.  ''It's getting later in the stock market and economic cycle,'' he said. ''When sailing into an impending storm, sailors prefer a larger ship.''  DATA WATCH -- The highlight of a thin post-holiday economic calendar may be the report on Wednesday of the nation's trade balance for November.  A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts a widening deficit, to $60 billion from $58.9 billion in October.  Retail sales for December, to be reported on Friday, are expected to rise by 0.6 percent after a 1.0 percent increase in November.  MARKET WEEK  ",

                    "text": "  With Michigan's new ban on affirmative action going into effect, and similar ballot initiatives looming in other states, many public universities are scrambling to find race-blind ways to attract more blacks and Hispanics.  At Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, a new admissions policy, without mentioning race, allows officials to consider factors like living on an Indian reservation or in mostly black Detroit, or overcoming discrimination or prejudice.  Others are using many different approaches, like working with mostly minority high schools, using minority students as recruiters, and offering summer prep programs for promising students from struggling high schools. Ohio State University, for example, has started a magnet high school with a focus on math and science, to help prepare potential applicants, and sends educators into poor and low-performing middle and elementary schools to encourage children, and their parents, to start planning for college.  Officials across the country have a sense of urgency about the issue in part because Ward Connerly, the black California businessman behind such initiatives in California and Michigan, is planning a kind of Super Tuesday next fall, with ballot initiatives against racial preferences in several states. He is researching possible campaigns in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, and expects to announce next month which states he has chosen.  Ann Korschgen, vice provost at the University of Missouri, said in a recent interview, ''Just this morning, we had a conversation along the line of how we would continue to ensure diversity at our campus if we could not consider race.''  The issue is already heating up in Colorado. This month, two Republican representatives in Colorado asked the state to examine the University of Colorado's spending on diversity, after a libertarian group questioned the expenditures.  Mr. Connerly said that a decade ago, when California passed its ban, Proposition 209, he thought the state was ahead of its time, but that now, he believes ''the country is poised to make a decision about race, about what its place in American life is going to be -- and I really believe the popular vote may be the way to achieve that.''  Both defenders and opponents of affirmative action say the lesson of last fall's campaign in Michigan -- where Proposition 2, banning race and gender preferences in public education, employment and contracting, passed by 58 percent to 42 percent despite strong opposition from government, business, labor, education and religious leaders -- is that such initiatives can succeed almost anywhere.  ''Certain things become popular as state initiatives, like the ban on gay marriages, and restrictions on affirmative action could become one of those things,'' said Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education.  If so, he said, private universities, with their wide discretion in admissions and financial aid, could have a competitive advantage regarding diversity, reshaping the landscape of higher education.  ''Private universities can do whatever they want, consistent with federal law and the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Hartle said. ''Where minority students have a choice between selective public universities that cannot use affirmative action, and selective private universities with strong affirmative action programs, the private universities may seem like the more hospitable places, which would give them an advantage in drawing a diverse student body.''  To many educators, that would be a troubling turnabout.  ''You'd think public universities are charged with special responsibility for ensuring access, but it could come to be exactly the opposite, if there are a lot of these state initiatives,'' said Evan Caminker, the dean of the University of Michigan Law School, adding, ''in terms of public values, it's a big step backward.''  Mr. Connerly is unbothered: If black and Hispanic students are rare at selective universities, the solution is better academic preparation, not special treatment in admissions. ''Every individual should have the same opportunity to compete,'' he said. ''I don't worry about the outcomes.''  Legally, affirmative action has been a moving target. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in cases involving the University of Michigan that race could be one of many factors in admissions, although admissions offices could not give extra points to minority candidates. Many colleges nationwide then moved to ''holistic'' review, considering applicants' ethnicity, but not awarding a set number of points. In states that could face a ballot initiative campaign, though, that standard could fall.  Nationwide, after 30 years of debate, and litigation, over affirmative action, universities have made strikingly little progress toward racially representative student bodies. And recently, with growing awareness that affluent students are vastly overrepresented at selective colleges, the longstanding focus on racial diversity has been joined by a growing concern about economic diversity.  Currently, four states with highly ranked public universities -- California, Florida, Michigan and Washington -- forbid racial preferences, either because of ballot propositions or decisions by elected officials.  Texas banned affirmative action for seven years. The University of Texas resumed consideration of race after the 2003 United States Supreme Court ruling. ''We need every tool we can get,'' concluded Dr. Bruce Walker, the university's director of admissions.  In California and Texas, the first two states to ban racial preferences, underrepresented minorities at the flagship universities declined -- even though both states, and Florida, adopted plans giving a percentage of top high school graduates guaranteed admission to state universities.  In Texas, students admitted through the Top 10 percent plan swamped the flagship Austin campus. But the plan, now being rethought by the Legislature, never brought in many minority students. Last fall, with both race-conscious admissions and the Top 10 plan, blacks made up an all-time high of 5 percent of the freshman class, and Hispanics 19 percent.  A decade after the California ban, only 2 percent of this year's freshmen at the University of California, Los Angeles, are black: a 30-year low. Hispanic representation at U.C.L.A. has dropped, too. At Berkeley, the number of blacks in the freshman class plunged by half the year after the ban, and the number of Hispanics nearly as much.  Systemwide, blacks make up only 3 percent of U.C. freshmen, although about 7 percent of the state's high school graduates are black. Most top black students choose private institutions over state campuses. Over all, of the top third of all students offered admission to the University of California class of 2005, most enrolled and only 19 percent went instead to selective private colleges. But among blacks in that group, 51 percent chose selective private colleges. Meanwhile, up the coast, Stanford University is enrolling more underrepresented minority students. Among this year's freshmen, 11 percent are African-American, up from 8 percent in 1995; Hispanic enrollment has risen, too.  ''Folks look for a place that's comfortable,'' said Richard Shaw, Stanford's admissions dean. ''They want a sense that there's kids like them at the institution.''  The University of Michigan, with other state institutions, tried to win a delay of the ban so it would not hit in the middle of this year's admissions cycle.But the courts rejected this effort, so officials have stopped considering race and gender as factors in admissions, and worry that next year's entering class will be less diverse. Many officials worry that they will lose top minority candidates to selective private universities.  ''We know from colleagues in Texas and California that if we can't take race into account, we're at a competitive disadvantage,'' said Julie Peterson, a spokeswoman for the University of Michigan, where two-thirds of the applicants are from out of state.  Since most of Michigan is overwhelmingly white, said Mary Sue Coleman, the university's president, a plan guaranteeing admission to a percentage of top high school graduates would have little impact, and nothing short of affirmative action will maintain the university's racial diversity.  ''Of course, you want to look at family income, and being the first in the family to attend college and those kinds of factors, of course we do that, but it doesn't get us to a racially diverse student body,'' Dr. Coleman said.  At the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, a program guaranteeing that low-income students can graduate debt-free helped to increase the percentage of blacks in the freshman class to 12 percent, and to increase both economic diversity and the enrollment of underrepresented minority students. Other states have started similar programs.  In Detroit, Wayne State University Law School recently adopted a new admissions policy. Jonathan Weinberg, the professor assigned last year to draft a contingency policy, looked at other states with race-blind admissions and found that instead of race, they look to ''a set of broader diversity concerns that go to socioeconomic status.''  Last month, the faculty adopted his policy, eliminating any mention of race, but broadening the factors the admissions office may consider. Those include being the first in the family to go to college or graduate school; having overcome substantial obstacles, including prejudice and discrimination; being multilingual; and residence abroad, in Detroit or on an Indian reservation.  Frank Wu, the law school's dean, said Wayne State's effort to comply with the law could bring a legal challenge.  ''There's a new fight building,'' Mr. Wu said, ''and that's going to be whether the mere fact that you're striving for diversity means you're somehow trying to get around the ban and find proxies, or pretexts, for race, and that that's impermissible. It's ironic, but in some quarters our effort to adopt a new policy to comply with Prop 2 has been interpreted as an effort to circumvent it.''  Roger Clegg, president of the Council for Equal Opportunity, which opposes racial preferences, said policies like Wayne State's do raise questions.  ''I have a real problem when schools adopt what on their face are race-neutral criteria, if they are doing so to reach a predetermined racial and ethnic goal,'' Mr. Clegg said. ''Both in law and in common sense, the motivation matters.''  At Ohio State University, where admissions are increasingly selective, officials are looking for a long-term answer. ''When we saw what was coming down the road, we started looking to other models, but no other model results in as much diversity,'' said Mabel Freeman, assistant vice president at Ohio State. ''The only long-term solution is to do better in the pipeline and make sure all kids get the best education possible, K-12.''  Correction:  January 31, 2007, Wednesday  A front-page article on Friday about efforts by public colleges to attract minority students misstated the name of the organization headed by Roger Clegg that opposes racial preferences. It is the Center for Equal Opportunity, not the Council for Equal Opportunity.  ",

                    "text": "  A new study estimates that employers cheat New York State's workers' compensation system by not paying $500 million to $1 billion a year in required insurance premiums, forcing other employers to pay higher premiums.  The study by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, found that these illegal underpayments represent 15 percent to 20 percent of all the workers' comp premiums that are supposed to be paid each year statewide.  Some companies pay no premiums while others underpay by underreporting the size of their work force to qualify for lower premiums, the study said.  Government, business and labor leaders say the noncompliance hurts the state's business climate by forcing law-abiding companies to pay higher workers' comp premiums when many corporations are already complaining that their premiums are too high.  ''We were surprised to find this magnitude of noncompliance,'' said James Parrott, the chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute. ''This noncompliance has helped cause at least two things: very low benefits for injured workers in New York, which are among the lowest in the country, and second, despite these low benefits, workers' comp premiums that are considered very high.''  Mr. Parrott said inadequate data made it hard to pinpoint the exact amount of cheating.  The report asserts that if more companies paid their full premiums, the extra money would enable the state to cut workers' comp premiums over all and increase benefits for injured workers. The report maintains that a lack of enforcement has emboldened employers to cheat.  ''Not being honest on payroll has become almost an accepted practice in New York State,'' said Art Wilcox, a workers' comp expert with the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''It hurts the competitiveness of a business that does the right thing. It hurts the competitiveness of an insurance broker who refuses to play games with payroll. And it certainly hurts any insurance carrier who won't bend the rules because they're competing against people who will.''  Michael Moran, a spokesman for the American Insurance Association, said he found it difficult to believe the level of noncompliance found by the study. ''It is very important for insurance companies to be paid correctly for all the people they cover,'' he said. ''They work at it very hard. They try to audit to make sure that things are right.''  The Fiscal Policy Institute based its calculations on financial numbers filed with state agencies. It bolsters the finding of a report last year by the state's association of insurance agents, which estimated, based on inside knowledge of industry practices, that up to 20 percent of New York's employers did not pay all their required premiums.  ''New York's honest businesses who are playing by the rules have had to subsidize those who don't even cover their employees or those who seriously underpay for the coverage they do have,'' said David Dickson, president of the association, Professional Insurance Agents of New York State. ''It approaches plain fraud.''  Gov. Eliot Spitzer has pledged to make major changes in the workers' comp system, hoping to hold down premiums and increase benefits. The maximum benefit an injured worker can now obtain is $400 a week.  ''Although we do not know the magnitude of the underreporting of workers' comp obligations, we recognize that it is a serious problem,'' said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for the governor.  Insurance experts say that a company with, say, 100 employees might tell its insurer that it has only 70 workers and then pay premiums for only 70.  But if any of the company's 100 employees are injured on the job, they would be likely to qualify for worker's comp benefits -- either medical coverage and weekly benefits in lieu of wages -- when they are out of work. This means that the amount collected in premiums might fall short of the amount spent on benefits. As a result of such a shortfall statewide, insurers often pressure New York officials to increase premiums for all employers in an effort to balance total premiums paid in with total benefits paid out.  ''The lack of aggressive enforcement forces everybody in the process to bend the rules,'' said Mr. Wilcox of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''If insurance company A enforces the law but all the rest don't, then the client will end up with insurance company B or C or D.''  In finding underpayments, the Fiscal Policy Institute first looked at the total amount of employee payroll -- $389 billion -- that the state's employers reported for 2003 to the Labor Department and Tax Department when they paid their unemployment insurance taxes. Then the institute examined the total payroll reported to the state agencies and the industry association that handle payroll data for employers paying workers' comp insurance. The total payroll reported for workers' comp came to just $311 billion (after the policy institute made some adjustments to account for excluded job categories.)  ''Manufacturers are paying significant amount of workers' comp, and they obviously pay more than they need to because it looks like a large percentage of companies aren't paying into the system,'' said Randall Wolken, president of the Manufacturers Association of Central New York. ''If we're inadvertently increasing some companies' costs, we inadvertently drive some companies out of the state.''  Last July, the state's insurance superintendent, Howard Mills, denied a request by insurers to increase workers' comp premiums, saying, ''The insurers' efforts to fight fraud -- both claimant and employer fraud -- can be said to be anemic at best.''  At the time, Mr. Mills, who stepped down last month, said that without a greater commitment by insurers to fight fraud, it would be hard to justify any overall increase in premiums.  One common practice, insurance experts say, is for companies, often taxi or trucking companies, to say that their drivers are independent contractors (who are not required to be part of the workers' comp system) when by many definitions they are actual employees.  As part of the campaign against fraud, Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and the State Insurance Fund, a state agency that provides workers' comp coverage to 194,000 employers, arrested Anthony Spychalsky last month and charged his company, NY Ceiling & Drywall, with underpaying premiums by at least $207,000. Mr. Spychalsky pleaded guilty on Jan. 8 to insurance fraud.  Many industry experts say the State Insurance Fund, which focuses on providing coverage to small business, is more aggressive in pursuing premium fraud than private insurance carriers.  Robert Lawson, the insurance fund's spokesman, said that in 2006, the fund's 200 auditors did 88,398 field audits. All the audits yielded an additional $89 million in revenues, coming to $493,000 per auditor, Mr. Lawson said.  Mr. Dickson, the head of the insurance agents' group, said, ''The level of audits that are conducted by the commercial carriers and the frequency of the audits, I don't see that at the same standard as the State Insurance Fund's efforts.''  Kenneth Adams, president of the Business Council of New York State, said, ''Whatever can be put in place to limit and reduce fraud by employers or injured workers, that will produce benefits throughout the system.''

                    "text": "  Martina Rosario and Antonio Colon would like nothing better than to move from the two small, dingy rooms they have lived in for more than 20 years, 15 of them with their daughter, Tabitha Colon. And the management of their building, on the Lower East Side, would certainly like them to move, which it made clear last year in its attempt to evict them.  But as cramped as they are in their fourth-floor space, and as difficult as it is for the ailing Ms. Rosario and partly paralyzed Mr. Colon to trudge up to it in their walkup building, they have fought to stay there.  They have done this, the financially struggling couple and a social worker aiding them say, despite the conditions -- and despite a rent that consumes half their annual income of less than $15,000 -- because the only option they see, moving into public housing, is not now available.  One reason is that the city's Housing Authority ''said they have a sketchy history'' of paying the rent in their current building, said the social worker, Sister Lucita Cangemi of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  Indeed, a representative of the building's management and Ms. Rosario recently agreed that the management had taken the couple to court several times because of rent disputes, and that they were currently behind in their rent by about $3,000. The rent is $700 a month, and their obligation is about $630, while the city's welfare program pays the rest, said Ms. Rosario, 43.  Translating from Spanish for Mr. Colon, her companion, who is 71 and speaks little English, she said that aside from their difficulties in affording the rent, Mr. Colon ''wants them to take him to court so he can fight them for a new lease and to fix the apartment.''  Among the problems, she said, is that the stove cannot be used because it leaks gas when it is turned on. Their lease has expired, and they occupy the apartment month to month, according to the management's papers in the eviction case last year. Eviction was avoided then, Ms. Rosario said, when the city's welfare system paid the arrears.  Sister Lucita said she would seek to get the couple free legal help with their rent and occupancy problems. But resolving those problems in their favor would still leave many more. For one thing, they would still be in their two cramped rooms, one of which, about 12 feet by 12 feet, serves as the bedroom for all of them, with Ms. Rosario and Tabitha, 15, sleeping in one bed and Mr. Colon in the other. The other room, similar in size, is a kitchen and a living room.  ''There's no privacy,'' Ms. Rosario said, sitting in the combination room, where pots, pans and other household items were stacked on shelves running high up on the walls or piled atop furniture that was chockablock with kitchen appliances. These included a microwave oven, which Catholic Charities bought for the family, using Neediest Cases money, so they could have warm meals without the expense of ordering in.  The family's housing situation reflects its poverty, which is deepened by the medical handicaps that Mr. Colon and Ms. Rosario say keep them from working. ''I had two knee replacements because of arthritis,'' she said, adding that she is also being treated for severe heart disease and high blood pressure.  Mr. Colon said recently that much of his left side, including his arm, was paralyzed, and he lost the sight in his left eye, 45 years ago, when, as a passer-by, he was shot on the Lower East Side. On Saturday, he was hospitalized with pneumonia, Ms. Rosario said last night.  The family lives on $1,234 a month, Ms. Rosario said: the parents' total of $894 in federal Supplemental Security Income benefits and $340 in food stamps. Sister Lucita helped the family get supplies from a food pantry and clothing donated for charity. Medicaid covers their health costs.  The couple told of hard lives as children in Puerto Rico and then New York, and of not having gone beyond elementary school. Ms. Rosario had a daughter with another man when she was 18. The next year, she met Mr. Colon, then 47.  They have lived in their apartment for the entire 24 years of what they refer to as their common-law marriage. Before Tabitha, they had a daughter who was mentally retarded and died at 12, Ms. Rosario said.  But all the past troubles and present grimness do not keep them from aspiring to a brighter future, hoping the Housing Authority will change its mind. ''We hope to get into the projects and leave this building,'' Ms. Rosario said, ''and our nerves will calm down, and we'll get a better life.''

                    "text": "  For all the heartache the Nets suffered in the early part of this five-game Western trip, vindication came in the sweetest form Monday night.  Vince Carter made a 3-pointer from 31 feet at the buzzer to lift the Nets to a 116-115 victory against the Utah Jazz. His basket gave the Nets a 2-3 trip after they lost each of the first three games by a point on their opponent's final shot.  ''Sometimes what goes around comes around,'' Coach Lawrence Frank said. ''Our guys deserve a great deal of credit for staying together.''  The shot capped a magnificent 33-point night for Carter, who over the past three games has played like a superstar that one would be silly to trade. Carter scored 16 points in the fourth quarter.  He got the opportunity for the winner after Jazz point guard Deron Williams, who had been terrific all game and finished with 25 points, made 1 of 2 free throws.  Without any timeouts, the Nets had to go the length of the court in five seconds. Carter did just that, pulling up from way out. He was mauled by his teammates after the shot.  ''About midway, I felt it was going in,'' Carter said. ''it's just a great feeling to actually see it going in.''  The Nets also received a big game from Jason Kidd (22 points, 10 assists) and the reserve guard Eddie House, who scored 19 points.  Carter saved most of his aggression for a fourth quarter in which the teams traded baskets and played at a very quick pace.  During one stretch, Carter scored 11 consecutive points. Although it is difficult to take the ball from his hands when he is that hot, the approach might have become somewhat predictable.  On one possession in the final two minutes of the game, Carter tried to work off a screen from the top of the key. When he reached the lane, the Jazz clogged it and Carter passed the ball to Mikki Moore, who gave it back to Carter. With the shot clock running down, Carter had to settle for a long fadeaway jump shot that missed.  The Jazz marched down the court and Williams made a jumper to give the Jazz a 114-110 lead with 1 minute 22 seconds to play.  That was as far as the Nets would fall in the closing minutes.  The Nets (22-23) began this trip at .500 and with the news that one of their best players, small forward Richard Jefferson, could miss up to six weeks after ankle surgery.  Under those circumstances, the expectations might not have been very high.  But the manner in which the Nets lost the first three games of this trip, meant that they had a lot to play for in the final two games, namely mental stability.  That is exactly what they gave themselves.  ''It's just a relief for our team,'' Carter said. ''We've been on the other side of the ball.''  They had a terrific defensive performance against the Denver Nuggets, who boasted two of the league's three leading scorers -- Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson. The Nets also were able to see the super abilities of Carter that have been missing at times. He scored 40 points against the Nuggets.  In the Jazz, the Nets were facing one of the surprise teams in the league. Utah entered the night leading the Northwest Division and with the fourth-best record in the Western Conference.  Kidd kept the Nets in the game in the first half with 20 points, 5 assists and 5 rebounds.  Early in the second quarter, the Nets' defense went sour and the Jazz took advantage, scored on six of seven possessions in a stretch of about four minutes. Utah received a boost on the inside from power forward Paul Millsap, who had 6 points and 6 rebounds in 15 minutes in the first half.  Earlier in the day, Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan raved about Millsap's performance against the Hornets on Saturday night. In that game, Millsap scored 15 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, 10 on offense, even though not a single play was called for him. Millsap kept several possessions alive for the Jazz by muscling his way around the basket.  Williams's jump shot with 6:16 to play in the first half capped a 13-5 run that put Utah ahead by 13 points.  That is when Kidd took charge. He had two 3-pointers, two layups and a pair of free throws during a 24-14 run to close the first half and cut the deficit to 56-53.  Kidd received help in the third quarter from Carter, who scored only 4 points and reached the free throw line once in the first half, and the Nets were collectively hot on offense throughout the period. Carter scored 13 points on 4-of-7 shooting and the team shot 64.7 percent in the quarter.  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, had created Sprint Nextel campaigns aimed at consumers. The assignment to create campaigns aimed at businesses is handled by Publicis & Hal Riney in San Francisco, part of the Publicis Groupe, which wants to take part in the review. Sprint Nextel spends about $1.5 billion a year on advertising.  Although Sprint Nextel had been the largest account at the TBWA/Chiat/Day New York office, the agency decided against participating in the review, according to a statement, ''with a clear understanding of Sprint's challenged business situation.'' The TBWA/Chiat/Day office in Playa del Rey, Calif., works with Apple, which is collaborating with a Sprint Nextel competitor, AT&T, on the new iPhone.  ADDENDA  ",

                    "text": "  To the Editor:  In his review of Florence Noiville's biography of Isaac Bashevis Singer (Dec. 24), D. T. Max quotes from Saul Bellow's English translation of Singer's ''Gimpel the Fool'': ''I had seven names in all: imbecile, donkey, flax-head, dope, glump, ninny and fool.'' This, he claims, sounds ''more like Augie March than someone from the old country,'' and he ''wonders'' about what Singer may have thought.  It is surely relevant to note that Bellow's English is a close and direct translation of Singer's Yiddish. The fact is that Yiddish speakers in the ''old country'' had plenty of words for fool, and presumably many occasions to use them. Singer's seven examples, each well rendered by Bellow, far from exhausted the storehouse. If you look in Nahum Stutchkoff's Yiddish thesaurus of 1950, published by YIVO, you will find 11 dense columns under the heading ''narishkayt.''  Paul Needham  Summit, N.J.  ",

                    "text": "  WORK on replacing the Roslyn Viaduct is expected to continue unabated now that the contractor and the Village of Roslyn Harbor are near agreement on how to transport large concrete beams to the construction site.  The replacement of the three-quarter-mile-long viaduct, which was built in 1948 and carries Route 25A, known locally as Northern Boulevard, has long been planned. But Gerson Strassberg, the village mayor, said that village officials were not told until November that 412 large concrete sections of the bridge would be transported along Roslyn Harbor streets from midnight to 5 a.m.  The plan called for the beams, some weighing 60 tons, to be taken to Roslyn Harbor from Virginia by barge and then placed on a flatbed truck and driven 1.3 miles to the viaduct along Glenwood Road and Bryant Avenue.  Mr. Strassberg said that village officials were also not told that because of the height of the beams -- some of them 17 feet high -- utility wires along the truck route had to be raised to 22 feet off the ground and tree limbs had to be cut.  After four meetings with the contractor, the Tully Construction Company, of Flushing, Queens, and the State Department of Transportation, Mr. Strassberg said it was agreed to minimize inconvenience to the village by using other roads to transport the smaller beams to the viaduct.  The viaduct is a main section of Route 25A, carrying 38,000 vehicles a day, but it has no shoulders, the sightlines are poor, and heavy trucks are prohibited.  Gerard Terry of Jericho, the lawyer for Tully Construction, said plans agreed to on Dec. 20 called for only about 60 percent of the beams to be transported through the village. He said the route for the other beams had yet to be determined.  Plans call for four beams to be moved each night using two flatbed trucks making two trips each. Typically, Mr. Terry said, the shipments will be made on a weeknight.  ''So we will be making about 120 trips through the village over the course of one year, and each trip takes approximately 10 minutes,'' Mr. Terry said.  The company and the village were still completing their agreement, with hopes of beginning the truck runs sometime this month.  The $120 million project is scheduled for completion in 2008.

NATO also said Wednesday that NATO-led troops and the Afghan National Security forces had detained a Taliban commander, whom it did not identify, in a raid on Tuesday in Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan.  The Afghan Intelligence Service said that it had detained the Taliban spokesman with two of his associates on Monday as they entered Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan from Pakistan.  The videotape showed a young Afghan who introduced himself as Abdul Haq and said he had been a spokesman for the Taliban for the past 14 months under the fictitious name of Dr. Muhammad Hanif. He said that Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, was in Quetta, Pakistan, with the support of Pakistan's security service.  The Afghan government and President Hamid Karzai have repeatedly accused Pakistan of sheltering Taliban leaders and fighters. Pakistan denies it. It was not known whether the statement on the tape about Mullah Omar, who has not been seen since 2001, was made under duress.  Also on Wednesday, a remotely controlled mine struck an Afghan National Army vehicle in Khost Province in the east, killing three soldiers and wounding four others, said Gen. Zahir Azimi, a Defense Ministry spokesman.  The blast occurred while Mr. Karzai was in Khost to inaugurate an national army installation, but he was miles from the site of the attack.  ",

The woman, visiting with her husband from out of state, had been waiting for him in a rented 2006 Chevrolet Equinox outside an apartment building on Park Place in Crown Heights at 2:45 a.m. when two strangers climbed in, pushed her into the passenger seat and drove off, the police said. The husband, who saw the men jump in, called 911, then called his wife on her cellphone, the police said. Apparently, the carjackers overheard him tell her that the police were on their way. They pulled over and fled on foot, taking only a wallet, the police said.  EMILY VASQUEZ  ",

                    "text": "  With very few exceptions, travelers in search of soft sand, crystal-clear waters and balmy breezes will find a good beach on almost any island in the West Indies. And everyone has a favorite.  There are a few standouts however, which www.frommers.com does a good job of summarizing in its list of ''best beaches.'' Those include Seven Mile Beach, a stretch of sugar-fine sand lined with condos and high-end resorts on Grand Cayman; Grace Bay Beach on Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos, which is conveniently fringed by a reef for snorkelers; and Grenada's Grand Anse Beach, which is within walking distance of most of the island's best hotels.  One island that's not on that list -- and thus might offer a better chance to find a beach of your own -- is Eleuthera, one of the so-called Out Islands of the Bahamas, about 60 miles from Nassau. There are few direct flights from the United States to this sickle-shaped island: you either have to fly down to Florida first, and get a connecting flight from there, or else fly to Nassau, where you can catch a flight or a ferry. (It's also not technically in the Caribbean; any geographer will tell you it's too far north to qualify. But who cares?)  Once there you'll have your pick of beaches. About 110 miles long and roughly a mile wide, the island is basically one big sand bar. There is Surfer's Beach for wave riders, Winding Bay for windsurfers, and Ten Bay Beach has soft sand and shallow waters for young children or people who prefer not to get their hair wet. You can also take a water taxi to Harbour Island, a three-and-a half-mile long cay just off Eleuthera's northern shore with pink sands that run along the island's eastern side. In the last decade, these remote shores have become favored by the likes of Elle Macpherson, Diane von Furstenberg and other bold-faced names.  WHERE TO STAY -- On Eleuthera: The Cove, 800-552-5960, outside Gregory Town, www.thecoveeleuthera.com (garden view rooms from $225), and Pineapple Fields, 877-677-9539, south of Governor's Harbour, www.pineapplefields.com (one-bedroom suites from $240).

Although the general store's space is ample, there are just 24 seats for eating-in. They are often full, with people munching savory or sweet crepes, house-made scones, sandwiches and other goodies made by four full-time chefs.  Available daily are four savory buckwheat crepes (a popular favorite is the wild mushroom with blue cheese) and six sweet ones (with banana-and-chocolate a crowd-pleaser). The fresh-made scones are another big hit, with different ones offered each day (try the peach-and-ginger or maple walnut if they're on the menu).  Among many popular sandwiches are the Southwest (turkey, bacon, avocado, Cheddar and chipotle mayonnaise on a ciabatta roll), ham and Brie (with green apples, honey mustard and tomato on multigrain bread) and the Mekong sub (pickled daikon radish, cucumber, fresh cilantro and five-spice sausage on a baguette). Simon's baguettes, made with butter and Portuguese sea salt, are another reason to make this a stop.  Owned for the last two and a half years by Jim and Jody Reilly, Simon's also produces many delicious dishes to go, including shepherd's pie, sausage-and-lentil stew and stuffed eggplant. There is also a good imported cheese selection, along with a variety of coffee drinks -- cappuccino, latte and the like, as well as Jim's Organic Coffees available in bulk.  This friendly, all-purpose food store is open Monday through Saturday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Simon's Marketplace, 17 Main Street, Chester; (860) 526-8984.

                    "text": "  A racing pulse, a tendency to startle at loud noises, nightmares and flashbacks -- these are the familiar symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. But a new study suggests that combat veterans who suffer from the disorder may also be at increased risk for heart attacks and fatal coronary heart disease.  The study is the first to suggest that the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or P.T.S.D., may actually be a cause of heart disease. And the more severe the symptoms of P.T.S.D., the researchers found, the greater the risk for disease.  The analysis was based on data from 1,946 veterans participating in a continuing study. The men, whose average age at the start of the study was about 62, had no pre-existing heart problems. Beginning in 1986, they were followed for more than 10 years, with periodic physical examinations and the updating of their medical records. Two self-administered scales were used to assess the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and to estimate their severity.  Over the course of the study, which appears in the January issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, 255 of the men developed either nonfatal heart attacks, fatal coronary heart disease or angina pectoris, the chest pain associated with heart problems.  The number and severity of the veterans' symptoms were significantly associated with nonfatal heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease, and somewhat less strongly linked to angina.  These results, the authors suggest, mean that people with more symptoms of the stress disorder are not simply prone to reporting aches and pains but actually at higher risk for disease.  ''In this sample, symptom levels were actually low to moderate,'' said Laura D. Kubzansky, the lead author and an assistant professor of society, human development and health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''So the fact that we have evidence of risk at these levels means that at even higher levels of symptomatology, where people might be significantly distressed and meet diagnostic criteria for P.T.S.D., you would expect to see even higher levels of risk.''  The exact mechanism through which post-traumatic stress might affect heart health is not known, but some researchers have suggested that the stress-caused release of hormones called catecholamines may lead to injury of the coronary arteries by altering blood flow or setting off chemical changes in the body. These hormones may also encourage the release of fatty acids that can be harmful to the heart.  The new study, the authors say, is the first to demonstrate an association between heart disease and symptoms of post-traumatic stress while controlling for many of the variables that might affect risk, including depression, smoking, a family history of heart disease, cholesterol levels and alcohol consumption.  The researchers acknowledge that the study's findings pertain largely to older white men who served in the military and therefore cannot be generalized to women, nonwhite men or civilians. Also, the data on psychological symptoms (although not on heart disease) depend on self-reports by the veterans rather than on interviews by doctors, and therefore may be less reliable.  The fact that the researchers determined the presence of post-traumatic stress before the onset of any heart disease strengthens the findings, they said, because it eliminates the problems of recall bias, when people erroneously attribute an illness to some unconnected event or anxiety in the past.  For a long time, Dr. Kubzansky said, people have assumed that those with anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder were simply more likely than others to report pain, and that the pain might not be real.  But the new findings, she continued, ''suggest that there are significant cardiotoxic effects of these disorders beyond just a sense of discomfort or pain.  ''We should be concerned about P.T.S.D. because it's a bad outcome in and of itself,'' she said. ''But this makes an even stronger argument that we should pay attention to those who have it to make sure they don't develop further problems down the road.''  ",

                    "text": "  Poland was convulsed in finger-pointing and recrimination on Tuesday as more allegations of former secret-police collaborators among the Roman Catholic clergy members spilled onto the country's front pages, sullying an institution that for decades was considered spotless in its fight against Communism.  And the stream of disclosures now promises to become a torrent: here in Krakow, the Rev. Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski is preparing to publish a book that will identify 39 priests whose names he found in Krakow's secret police files, three of whom are now bishops in the Polish church.  Perhaps the most explosive assertion by people in the church is that the taint of collaboration was known for decades but kept quiet out of respect for -- or perhaps even at the behest of -- the Polish-born Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005.  ''The church didn't want to hurt the pope, but actually, more harm was done by keeping silent,'' Father Zaleski, 50, said in an interview at the hilltop compound of a charity he runs outside Krakow.  The sudden focus on the fallibility of a church thought to be heroically anti-Communist followed the Vatican's choice of Bishop Stanislaw Wielgus as archbishop of Warsaw despite clear signals of his ties to Poland's secret police. Bishop Wielgus resigned Sunday after admitting his secret past.  ''There is a sort of unholy alliance in Poland that has been present for many years, but is fully visible only recently, that is based on a culture of mendacity,'' said Andrzej Zybertowicz, professor of sociology at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, the heart of the Polish church's most conservative camp.  He argued that there were three elements of this alliance: former members of the secret police and the Communist Party who are now active in business and politics; apologists who wanted to forgive and forget past collaboration; and an influential part of the hierarchy of the Polish church.  Collaboration in the clergy is not unique to Poland. Church officials across the Communist world were commonly bent to ignoble service. Some of that has come to light as Eastern bloc countries have peered into their secret police archives.  But Poland is unique in that the church remained stronger there than elsewhere in the Communist world. That was largely because Poland's primate at the time, Archbishop Stefan Wyszynski, agreed to cooperate with the Communist authorities, preaching compromise -- up to a point, beyond which he said the faithful should not yield.  Most researchers who have delved into the archives of the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, estimate that thousands of the country's priests, monks and nuns at the time -- as many as 10 percent of the total -- collaborated with the secret police to some degree.  Poland's current primate and archbishop of Warsaw, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, told an Italian news agency last year that the overall percentage was 15 percent. The percentage was likely to have been much higher in major cities and university towns, some historians say, where surveillance was heavier.  But the most troubling aspect of the recent allegations is how high past collaborators have climbed in the church hierarchy. On Tuesday, the Dziennik newspaper, the third largest daily in the country, reprinted excerpts from a secret 1978 police document concerning a dozen high-ranking church officials -- at least one of whom was a bishop at the time -- indicating that the secret police tried unsuccessfully to influence the appointment of a new primate of Poland, the highest position in the Polish church.  The document gave only code names, like Ramses (cited as a bishop), Professor and Shepherd, but the newspaper promised to disclose those identities soon.  The disclosures have gripped this deeply religious nation -- the largest bloc of devout Roman Catholics left in Europe -- and sparked anger toward the church for letting the frenzied news media disclose them, rather than researching the archives and reporting the findings on its own.  ''The church is guilty because it had the possibility to cleanse itself by publishing honest data about the clergy's activities during the Communist time,'' Father Zaleski said. The church argues that coming to terms with the past is a matter of personal sin that should be handled within the church in a spirit of forgiveness. It also argues that the public disclosure of secret service files on clergy members could do the church harm because many of the documents are false or misleading.  But many people say the church has been overly cautious for fear of tarnishing its Communist-era image as a champion of freedom.  But the church is caught in the dilemma of risking a loss of trust whether it explores the collaboration or continues to treat it as an internal matter. The results could be as bad for the Vatican as they are for the Polish church, because Rome had hoped the church could keep this bastion of the faithful in an otherwise fast secularizing Europe.  Church officials now say that collaboration by some of the Polish clergy members was a quietly understood fact of life under the Communist government that ran Poland from 1944 until 1989.  That was obscured while the pope was still alive. But not even two weeks after his death, in April 2005, the Institute of National Remembrance published documents that showed that the Rev. Konrad Stanislaw Hejmo, a Dominican priest posted to the Vatican, passed information to the secret service's antichurch branch. Father Hejmo admitted giving the information but denied that he was a spy.  During the 25th anniversary celebrations for the Solidarity trade union in Gdansk that August, a friend told Father Zaleski that there was a secret police file on him in Krakow. When he returned to the city, Father Zaleski visited the archives and was stunned to find a file crammed with 500 pages of documents about him.  ''I was shocked by that,'' Father Zaleski said in his garret office. He was even more troubled when he read that two priests had provided the secret police information on his activities. Though the priests were identified only by code names, they were described so precisely, he said, that he knew who they were.  ''I just couldn't imagine that there were priests who had cooperated with the secret police,'' he said.  He sought guidance from the Krakow archbishop, Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, a longtime personal secretary to Pope John Paul II. But Father Zaleski said he was at first ignored and then told to pray. Eventually, his superiors advised that he burn the documents.  ''They weren't interested at all in knowing anything about this,'' he said, rifling through a stack of photocopies stamped by the Institute of National Remembrance.  In a meeting with former Solidarity members at a Krakow-area steel mill last January, Father Zaleski suggested that the church authorities engage in ''lustration,'' as the process of vetting people for past Communist collaboration is known in the former Eastern bloc.  Journalists attending the meeting wrote about Father Zaleski's suggestion. ''It started a storm among the church authorities in Krakow,'' he recalled. ''The archbishop's office published an open letter condemning my activities.'' He decided to undertake the project alone and promised to publish his findings.  The church, meanwhile, publicly acknowledged that some of its clergy members had collaborated and issued an apology for their sins in March. It called on priests, monks and nuns who had collaborated with the secret services to confess -- to the church if not publicly. Seven of the country's 41 Roman Catholic dioceses have since set up commissions to help priests review their files. But none of the commissions has issued a report on its findings.  The disclosures continued, each more shocking than the last. In May, the Rev. Michal Czajkowski, co-president of Poland's Council of Christians and Jews, was accused of having spied for the secret police for 24 years. He resigned his posts and issued an apology.  Next, the press accused the Rev. Mieczyslaw Malinski, a close lifelong friend of Pope John Paul, of collaborating under the code name Delta. Father Malinski admitted having had contacts with the secret police but denied that he was a spy.  When Father Zaleski decided to begin publishing disclosures in May, Cardinal Dziwisz forbade him to do so or to speak to the press because it would undermine ''love for the church and Christ.'' The cardinal issued an order prohibiting any member of the clergy from delving into Krakow's secret police archives without his authorization.  But after he met with Cardinal Dziwisz in June, the archbishop agreed to let him proceed on the condition that Father Zaleski seek comment from the clergymen he intended to identify.  Cardinal Dziwisz could not be reached for comment.  The Rev. Jozef Kloch, the Warsaw episcopate spokesman, said that while Father Zaleski ''can publish whatever he likes, he and his editorial office will be responsible for the consequences.''  Father Zaleski found the 39 priests identified as ''TWs,'' short for tajny wspolpracownik, or secret collaborator. Four of them are now bishops.  Of the 39, 22 answered his request for comment, the majority denying that they were collaborators, and 4 admitting that they were. One of those who he wrote to was the Rev. Janusz Bielanski, who resigned as rector of Wawel Cathedral here on Monday, citing the allegations.  Only one of the bishops responded, and he supplied Father Zaleski with documents that showed he had refused to cooperate with the secret police. But the three bishops who did not respond, along with the other priests, will be identified in his book, which goes to print in mid-February.  ",

                    "text": "  Iran is barring 38 nuclear agency inspectors from entering the country in retaliation for a United Nations resolution aiming to curb Iran's nuclear program, a senior Iranian lawmaker said Monday.  The announcement came only days after Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, Iran's most senior dissident cleric, criticized President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's defiant stance against the West on the nuclear issue in a speech on Friday, calling it provocative. His comments were the first direct public attack on the president's nuclear policy by such a senior cleric.  The two developments suggest an increasingly open debate within Iran over how forcefully to confront the West over Iran's nuclear ambitions, even as its government continues to defend them.  Two hard-line newspapers, including one owned by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have already called for the president to stay out of all nuclear matters. Ayatollah Montazeri said Iran has the right to nuclear technology but questioned the way Mr. Ahmadinejad has confronted the West.  ''One has to deal with the enemy with wisdom,'' he said. ''We should not provoke the enemy, otherwise the country will be faced with problems.  ''We should get our right in a way that it does not create problems or excuses for others,'' he said.  ''Besides, is this our only irrefutable right and we have no other rights?'' he asked, referring to rising inflation since Mr. Ahmadinejad took office over a year ago.  Ayatollah Montazeri was once in line to become Iran's supreme religious leader, until he was banished and put under house arrest for his criticisms. His comments reflect the growing concern in Iran over additional economic sanctions if Iran continues to defy the international demand to halt its uranium enrichment program.  The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 23 and imposed sanctions banning the trade of goods related to Iran's nuclear program. It also gave Iran a deadline of two months to halt its uranium enrichment program or face tougher sanctions.  In response, Parliament passed a bill last month calling for the government to limit its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  ''The committee has decided to bar 38 inspectors from coming to Iran and we have announced the new limitation to the agency,'' said Alaedin Boroujerdi, the head of Parliament's committee for foreign policy and national security, the ISNA news agency reported.  The nuclear agency's inspectors visit Iran's nuclear facilities regularly. But last summer Iran said that it had decided not to let some of the inspectors return.  Still, Mr. Boroujerdi said that Iran planned to continue its cooperation with the agency, and that Iran would remain a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  An I.A.E.A. spokeswoman, Melissa Flemming, said that the agency was confident that it could continue to monitor Iran's nuclear program.  ''There are a sufficient number of inspectors designated for Iran, and the I.A.E.A. is able to perform its inspection activities in accordance with Iran's Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement,'' she said in an agency statement.  For his part, Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed again on Sunday that Iran would continue with its nuclear program, and brushed off the United Nations resolution as insignificant.  In Brussels on Monday, European Union foreign ministers called for all countries to enforce the sanctions against Iran. The British foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, said a collective application of the sanctions was essential ''to keep pressure on Iran to accept the offer of the international community to come back to the negotiating table.''  European Union officials said they would apply the measures next month, including a ban on selling materials and technology that could be used in Iran's nuclear and missile programs and the freezing of the assets of 10 Iranian companies and individuals.  Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said it was time to take a tough and united stance on Iran but kept the option of diplomacy open. ''There is a need to send a clear signal, and we need to show resolve,'' he said.  Correction:  January 25, 2007, Thursday  A front-page article on Friday about criticism of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, by Iranian religious authorities over his involvement in the country's nuclear program misstated the connection between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and Jomhouri-Eslami, a newspaper that has rebuked Mr. Ahmadinejad. (The error was repeated in an article about Iran on Tuesday.) Ayatollah Khamenei owned the newspaper until 1989, when he became supreme leader and transferred ownership to Massih Mohajeri, a conservative politician. However, the newspaper still reflects Ayatollah Khamenei's views.  ",

                    "text": "  When Nina Taylor, the design studio manager of Graham & Brown, an English wallpaper manufacturer, created the Drama collection to mark the company's 60th anniversary, she looked to its archives for old designs she could update, many of which had never been produced as wallcoverings. The lozenge-shaped Boheme, below left, was based on a hand-painted design from the 1970s. To create the new pattern, Ms. Taylor ''straightened the lines,'' she said, ''so it would repeat more easily.'' Midsummer, a delicate leaf pattern created in 2000, left, was merely simplified. ''It had been more mottled, more painterly, more textured,'' she said. The collection includes six other patterns. A double roll, 20.5 inches by 11 yards, sells for $60 at www.grahambrown.com or (800) 554-0887.  ELAINE LOUIE  CURRENTS: WALLPAPER  ",

                    "text": "  When overweight people lose weight, they often lose bone mineral density as well, increasing their risk for osteoporosis. But new research suggests that losing weight with exercise rather than calorie restriction can preserve bone strength.  Scientists randomly assigned 48 healthy, non-obese people in their 50s to three groups for a one-year study. The first group reduced calorie intake by 16 percent in the first three months and then 20 percent for the rest of the year. The second increased daily energy expenditure -- exercise, in other words -- by 16 percent in the first three months and then by 20 percent for the following nine months, carefully tracked by trainers using heart rate monitors. A control group was monitored without being assigned a diet or exercise program. The results appear in the Dec. 11 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.  The diet group lost an average of about 17 pounds; the exercise group about 14 pounds. But the people on the low-calorie diet also lost bone mineral density -- more than 2 percent at the spine, hips and leg. Those in the exercise group experienced no significant change in bone density, and the controls lost neither weight nor bone density.  The authors acknowledge that their sample was not large and did not examine sex differences in bone mineral density responses.  Dr. Dennis T. Villareal, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, recommends diet and exercise together in a weight-loss program. ''That way, you get the weight loss benefits of the diet,'' he said, ''but prevent the negative effect on bone health.''  VITAL SIGNS: ON THE SCALES  ",

                    "text": "  Wendy's International is unexpectedly changing agencies after working since August 2002 with two New York agencies that are part of the McCann Erickson Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Wendy's spends about $300 million a year on local and national advertising in major media.  Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, becomes the lead creative agency, replacing McCann Erickson Worldwide, which created national campaigns with spending estimated at $225 million. Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners, will work on creative projects, a new assignment. The media planning and buying parts of the account are being shifted from Universal McCann to MediaVest in New York, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of Publicis.  Since 2005, when Wendy's began to struggle with a sales slump, there had been speculation the company was seeking to change agencies. A sales rebound in the fourth quarter of 2006 damped that speculation.  ''Now that a turnaround has taken place in our business, we believe the timing is right to seek new resources to take our advertising efforts to the next level,'' said Ian B. Rowden, chief marketing officer at Wendy's in Dublin, Ohio. A campaign to replace the McCann Erickson work is expected in the spring.  Wendy's is the second big account gain for Saatchi & Saatchi in four months, after J. C. Penney. The Wendy's assignment to create campaigns aimed at Hispanic consumers will remain at the Vidal Partnership in New York.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA  ",

                    "text": "  Q. What is the best way to clean leather furniture?  A. In general, smooth leather surfaces need to be wiped with a damp cloth to remove any dust or grime. Because of exposure to central heating, the sun and other environmental factors, most leather also requires moisture to keep it from cracking, flaking or splitting. Think about your own skin in winter, or worse, the disintegrating 1930s leather club chairs found at flea markets around the world.  Once or twice a year I break out a tin of saddle soap and a sponge moistened with a little warm water, and lather up everything made of leather in the house, from a briefcase I bought in Buenos Aires to the seats of my Greek Revival-style dining chairs. The secret is to use the saddle soap sparingly; a minuscule amount is enough to clean and moisturize. After the soap has dried, I buff the leather with a soft, dry cloth.  ''People get carried away when it comes to cleaning leather,'' said Teddy Edelman, a founder of Edelman Leather, a Connecticut firm whose leather furniture, upholstery, floor tiles and rugs are favorites with top interior designers.  She has heard horror stories of leather being subjected to inappropriate cleaning agents including furniture polish. (I once cleaned a lovely cowhide desktop with the abrasive side of a kitchen scrubbing sponge, which resulted in a number of disfiguring abrasions.)  ''Leather is like your skin,'' Mrs. Edelman said. ''It's basically resistant to dirt, so there's no reason to overclean it.''  In addition to saddle soap, Mrs. Edelman said, ''a tiny bit of Castile soap, just a couple of drops in a quart of warm water, applied with a barely moist sponge or cloth, works well too.''  When her antique Biedermeier chairs start looking ''a bit exhausted,'' she added, she refreshes their leather upholstery with Lexol conditioner. For information and store locations, lexol.com or (800) 241-6996.  Q. How do I get rid of a heavily textured ceiling?  A. Most of my childhood bedroom was great: my mother let me decorate one wall with a huge orange fishing net, which I studded with starfish, glass weights and other nautical gear picked up along the Embarcadero in San Diego. But the ceiling looked as if it had been finished with cake frosting. Since then, I haven't been able to abide textured ceilings.  Before you do anything, break off a few small samples and have them tested for asbestos by an Environmental Protection Agency-approved lab. (You can find an appropriate lab in the Yellow Pages under Asbestos Removal.) If the asbestos is found, your best solution is to cover the ceiling with a layer of Sheetrock. But if you get the all-clear and you are handy, then move everything out of the room and cover the floor with dropcloths, newspapers or contractor's paper (which comes in large rolls), and get ready for a very messy operation. There will be lots of dust, so wear a disposable mask.  The only way to remove a textured spray-on surface is to moisten and scrape it, small section by small section. Fill a pump sprayer with warm water and carefully soak a four-by-four-foot area of the surface until it is wet enough to be removed with a trowel or a metal scraper. Your goal is to get down to the underlying ceiling, which is likely gypsum board. You may have to go over the ceiling a couple of times to get rid of it all.  Once the textured gunk is gone, break out a pole sander and gently sand the ceiling until it is as smooth as possible. Patch any scrapes or gouges with joint compound and sand again once those repairs are thoroughly dry. Now the ceiling is ready to prime and paint.  ",

                    "text": "  The Los Angeles Lakers missed Kobe Bryant's other-worldliness, fans at Madison Square Garden missed his showmanship and the Knicks, for once, did not miss the golden opportunity that was handed to them.  They rode Eddy Curry's offense, enjoyed a surprising resurgence by Jared Jeffries and beat back the Lakers for a 99-94 victory last night. With Bryant yanked from the stage by a league suspension, the evening lacked pyrotechnics, star quality and drama.  But for those who came to see the Knicks (20-27) claim a rare victory against an elite team, the night ended with some satisfaction. All five starters scored in double figures, led by Curry's 27 points. Jeffries, who started for the injured Quentin Richardson, filled up the box score and had a game-clinching block with 12.1 seconds left to play.  The Knicks, who had beaten just one team with a winning record in the past month, held on despite losing a 9-point lead in the first half and a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter.  ''You're never going to blow them out,'' Coach Isiah Thomas said. ''They're a team with a great coach, who understands how to manipulate a game and keep his team close.''  Thomas praised the Lakers (27-18) at length for their resiliency and, with a smile, concluded: ''But I'm glad Kobe didn't play. I'm really happy he didn't play.''  Twice in the previous eight days, the Knicks lost to teams missing their star players -- in Milwaukee (Michael Redd) and Miami (Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal). The Lakers, who were also missing the starters Luke Walton and Kwame Brown, kept the game close behind Lamar Odom (25 points and 9 rebounds).  Odom and Vladimir Radmanovic made 3-pointers to spark a late rally, knocking the deficit down to 96-94 with 45.8 seconds left. Curry hit two free throws to extend the lead to 4 points. He finished 9 for 12 from the foul line -- no small thing, given his own struggles and Thomas's recent rant about the Knicks' poor foul shooting. The Knicks shot free throws for an hour on Monday.  ''It meant a lot,'' Curry said of his late free throws, ''because I know how important free throws are to this team and especially to Coach.''  After Curry's free throws, the Lakers' Maurice Evans had a 3-pointer rattle out of the rim, but they still had a chance after Jamal Crawford ran (or was bumped) out of bounds for a turnover. But Jeffries reached out and blocked a 3-point try by Brian Cook in the corner, handing the Lakers their first three-game losing streak of the season.  Only a week ago, Jeffries was benched by Thomas and had his playing time slashed. Jeffries had been ineffective for weeks. But with Richardson nursing a sprained elbow, Thomas turned back to Jeffries, who responded with his best game in a month -- 14 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals, 2 blocked shots and 1 turnover in 32 minutes.  ''I thought the way he competed was impressive, considering the ups and downs that he's been having,'' Thomas said.  Booed during pregame introductions, Jeffries was cheered for his hustle several times throughout the night.  ''Those kind of things are why I'm here,'' said Jeffries.  Stephon Marbury scored 22 points but aggravated his sore left knee and sat out the last 35.2 seconds. He landed awkwardly after leaping to grab an errant inbounds pass from Jeffries.  Marbury recently sat out a game to rest the knee but said he would play tonight in Charlotte.  ''I just landed funny,'' he said. ''I'm all right.''  The chance to see Bryant had drawn a larger-than-usual cadre of celebrities, from the comedian Jon Stewart to the rapper Eve, the singer Nick Lachey and the real-estate mogul Donald Trump.  Bryant was suspended earlier in the day, for elbowing San Antonio's Manu Gin\u00f3bili in the face Sunday during a loss to the Spurs. Fans booed loudly when the suspension was announced before tip-off -- an unheard-of reaction, given that the punishment was for an opponent.  Thomas did not share their disappointment.  ''I'm a big fan of Kobe and I like him personally,'' Thomas said. ''You hate to see anyone suspended. But I don't want to face him, I don't want to face Shaq, I don't want to face Vince Carter, I don't want to face any of the best players in the league, because I know what they're capable of.''  What about the fans, who were denied their only chance to see Bryant play here this season?  ''Video games, television, catch him the next time,'' Thomas said with a laugh. ''I'm sure they'll have a couple of national television games, and all of New York can tune in and watch him.''  REBOUNDS  Quentin Richardson said that his right elbow injury was not serious and that he hoped to return to the lineup tonight in Charlotte. Richardson sprained the elbow in a practice last week and scored 6 points over his next three games, going 3 for 14 from the field. ''It just wasn't feeling that good,'' said Richardson, who is averaging 13.3 points. Richardson had a bandage on the elbow when he spoke with reporters, but he said he had not received an injection or had the elbow drained. ''It got scratched,'' he said.  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  It wasn't until the Hungarian photographer MARTIN MUNKACSI (1896-1963) turned his lens on fashion models that he made his fortune. But he established his reputation with reportage, much of it published in German photo weeklies. Now the International Center of Photography is mounting an exhibition of his work. The show, ''Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!,'' organized by F. C. Gundlach at the Haus der Photographie in Hamburg, includes more than 125 vintage photographs, along with magazines and page layouts. Mr. Munkacsi's images of models running on the beach revolutionized fashion photography by being natural rather than posed. Friday through April 29, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, icp.org.  It was the photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson who arguably put Mr. Munkacsi on the map, so taken was he with Mr. Munkacsi's photo ''Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika,'' taken in 1929 or 1930. Cartier-Bresson said of the picture, ''I suddenly understood that photography can fix eternity in a moment.'' It seems appropriate, then, that the International Center of Photography is simultaneously featuring an exhibition of Cartier-Bresson's work, which also starts Friday. Called ''HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON'S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,'' the show includes 251 prints personally selected and printed by the photographer. The show was originally assembled by the Museum of Modern Art as a memorial when Cartier-Bresson was presumed dead after having been held in German prisoner-of-war camps during World War II. (He actually escaped the camps and died in 2004 at 95.)  The WINTER ANTIQUES SHOW returns to the Seventh Regiment Armory on Friday with a core of 28 specialists in American antiques and art, including Shaker, folk art, American Indian, Colonial, Federal, Arts and Crafts, and Aesthetic Movement pieces. The show also features exhibitors showing British, European and Asian antiques, from old master paintings to Chinese export porcelain. Through Jan. 28, noon to 8 p.m. (to 6 p.m. on Jan 21, 25 and 28; to 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 20), Park Avenue at 67th Street, winterantiquesshow.com; $20.  ",

                    "text": "  Toyota is putting its reputation as a premium automaker to a test by pricing its redesigned pickup, the Tundra, several thousand dollars higher than comparable trucks made by General Motors and Ford.  Sticker prices for the bigger and brawnier 2007 Tundra, which goes on sale in mid-February, will begin at $22,290 for the most basic model and go as high as $41,850. The Chevrolet Silverado, which also was revamped for 2007, has a base price of $17,860, while Ford's F-series, the segment's longtime leader, starts at $18,275.  Of the six full-size pickups available in the United States, only the Nissan Titan has a higher starting price, and none has a high-end price greater than the Tundra's. Last year's Tundra ranged in price from $16,155 to $33,575.  Jesse Toprak, an analyst with Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice, said the Toyota pickup cost about $1,100 more than the most popular version of the Chevrolet Silverado, which was introduced late last year.  ''Toyota is confident in their new product. They know their brand strength will probably carry the price point,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''They hope that people who buy this truck will not need a good deal or a high incentive -- they'll buy the vehicle on its merits.''  ''Perhaps that's a little bit arrogant,'' he went on, ''but it's been kind of their continuing strategy.''  Comparing prices for similarly equipped pickup trucks is difficult, because manufacturers offer multiple cab sizes, bed lengths, engine sizes and suspensions.  There are 31 versions of the Tundra and dozens more of the Silverado.  The risk for Toyota will be if consumers conclude it is too expensive after comparison shopping on the Internet. ''They may be out of the consideration sets of some consumers, simply because it has the highest price,'' Mr. Toprak said.  Toyota considers the new Tundra, built in San Antonio as well as Princeton, Ind., to be the most important vehicle it has ever sold in the United States. It expects to sell about 200,000 trucks a year, primarily to owners of other Toyota vehicles who purchased pickups from G.M., Ford and Chrysler.  Automakers sold about 2.3 million big pickup trucks in the United States last year. Sales of the F-series dropped 11.7 percent in 2006, which Ford attributed to a spike in gasoline prices and a slowdown in the housing market, which caused contractors to delay purchasing new trucks.  To counter the shift toward more fuel-efficient vehicles, Detroit's automakers have been offering discounts of several thousand dollars on their pickups, making the price gap between the new Tundra and a truck like the F-series even larger.  A G.M. spokesman, John M. McDonald, said the automaker was confident that the Silverado, which was named the North American truck of the year at this month's Detroit auto show, would have little trouble competing against the Tundra, regardless of the price Toyota sets.  ''It speaks to the fact that American automakers can produce a truck that has the best quality and sell it at a price that is as good as or better than the competition,'' Mr. McDonald said.  ",

                    "text": "  At the Final Four in Boston last April, the North Carolina women's basketball team saw a night full of promise dissolve into a disquieting mess.  The top-seeded Tar Heels lost in a semifinal to Maryland, which went on to win the national championship against Duke. North Carolina guard Ivory Latta said the flight home was filled with quiet tears.  Weeks and months passed, and Latta refused to watch the film from that game.  But on Friday, as the undefeated Tar Heels prepared for Sunday's game against Maryland, North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell figured the time was right. Her players sat and stomached last season's end.  ''Man, it was depressing,'' Latta said. ''It was very hard to watch.''  But Latta said the film was also helpful. The players noticed simple mistakes they had made and vowed not to repeat them. At the Comcast Center on Sunday, the second-ranked Tar Heels took their long-awaited shot at the No. 3 Terrapins. This time, they walked off the court delighted, with an 84-71 victory that snapped Maryland's 19-game home winning streak before a crowd of 17,950 that was the largest to attend an Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season women's game.  ''Playing against North Carolina, playing against Duke, the revenge factor is so, so big right now,'' said Maryland forward Laura Harper, whose team lost to Duke, 81-62, on Jan. 13. ''They come ready to play us.''  For a time, North Carolina's victory looked as if it would come easily. The Tar Heels (23-0, 7-0) raced to a 20-point second-half lead behind the shooting of Latta, who made six 3-pointers and finished with 32 points.  But Maryland (21-2, 5-2) responded with a furious comeback that was led by the senior guard Shay Doron, who scored 13 of her 19 points in the second half. With 3 minutes 13 seconds left, Doron converted a 15-footer, pulling the Terrapins to 67-66.  ''She just kept putting them up, making shots and all,'' Hatchell said. ''But, you know, that's Maryland; I knew they could score like that.''  The Tar Heels, who entered the game as the nation's top-scoring team, can pounce quickly, too. They closed the game with a 17-5 run, and revenge was theirs.  When Maryland, Duke and North Carolina reached the Final Four last season, it was the first time a conference had placed three teams in the national semifinals; the A.C.C. had never sent more than one.  This season, the three A.C.C. powers have a combined record of 65-2, with the two losses coming within their impressive triumvirate. Maryland plays host to Duke on Feb. 18 but will not face North Carolina again in the regular season. North Carolina plays host to Duke on Feb. 8 before visiting the Blue Devils on Feb. 25.  Sunday's game became a sellout more than two weeks ago. The atmosphere and the national-television audience might have caused some early-game jitters for the Terrapins. Maryland missed 15 of its first 18 field-goal attempts and committed 10 turnovers in the first 10 minutes.  ''Anxiousness, nerves, whatever you want to call it,'' Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. ''But at the same time, we have played on the biggest stage before.''  With 30 seconds remaining in the first half and North Carolina leading, 33-27, Maryland guard Kristi Toliver was hounded by two defenders as she struggled to bring the ball across midcourt. Frese stomped the floor and yelled to a referee, frustrated that a foul had not been called. She received a technical foul, and Latta made both free throws, giving the Tar Heels an 8-point halftime lead. Latta made four 3-pointers in the first 4:50 of the second half, putting North Carolina ahead by 20.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL  ",

PATRIOTS' DEFENSE  In the teams' first meeting, the Jets' offensive line gave up four sacks in a 24-17 loss. In the November rematch, the Patriots were without the injured Ty Warren, their stellar left end. In his absence, the Jets were successful running the ball, gaining 117 yards on the ground (65 more than in the first game) en route to a 17-14 victory. Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork expects to return after missing three games with a sprained ankle. He will be a handful for Jets center Nick Mangold, who has been nursing a left thigh injury. The other rookie on the Jets' line, D'Brickashaw Ferguson, faces the difficult task of slowing the Patriots' right end, Richard Seymour, who has 4 sacks and 40 tackles.

The man, Raseed Watson, 21, of Paterson, N.J., was extradited to Nassau County on Tuesday and arraigned yesterday on one count of first-degree robbery, the police said. The police said they believed that Mr. Watson fired the shot that injured the boy, John Henry Romano Jr., now 10, and expected to file additional charges against him. Investigators said Mr. Watson was one of three men who entered the Inwood home in September and engaged in a gunfight with the owner. A 22-year-old Brooklyn man was arrested in the case in October, and a third suspect remains at large, the police said.  NICOLE COTRONEO  ",

                    "text": "  Two drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease and other disorders can seriously damage heart valves, researchers are reporting.  The drugs are pergolide, sold as Permax, and cabergoline, sold as Dostinex. Permax is approved in the United States and overseas for Parkinson's. Dostinex is used for Parkinson's in other countries but is approved in this country only for a hormonal disorder, hyperprolactinemia.  New findings on the drugs are described in two studies being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.  Permax already carries a black-box warning label -- the strongest warning required by the Food and Drug Administration -- about an increased risk of heart-valve problems. Such warnings, bordered in black, appear at the top of prescribing information to get doctors' attention. The Permax warning was added in 2003, based on a small number of reported cases. It includes this statement: ''Some patients have required valve replacement, and deaths have been reported.''  A milder warning about valve problems was added to Dostinex just last month. It is identified as a ''precaution,'' which means there is no black box, and the advice is in a less obvious part of the prescribing information for doctors.  A spokeswoman for the drug agency said that it had worked with the makers of both drugs on the labeling changes, but that she did not know whether the new findings would lead to further changes.  Dr. Michael S. Okun, the medical director for the National Parkinson Foundation, said people taking Permax or Dostinex for Parkinson's should be told about the new information and given a chance to switch to other drugs. He added that patients who were just starting treatment should be given other drugs. Safer, equally effective drugs are available, he said.  Dr. Okun, who was not involved in the two studies, is also co-director of the Parkinson Disease and movement disorders center at the University of Florida in Gainesville.  He said doctors in poorer countries might favor Permax and Dostinex because they are cheaper than some other Parkinson's drugs. But Dr. Okun said it would cost no more to switch patients to the old Parkinson's standby drug, L-dopa or levodopa, which has side effects of its own, but has never been known to damage heart valves.  ''Patients should be given the choice of what to do,'' Dr. Okun said. ''There are lots of people worldwide who have used these drugs successfully. Some patients, after being educated, may decide they want to accept the potential risk. Others may want to switch.''  Another researcher took a far different view.  ''I would just recommend not prescribing these drugs,'' said that researcher, Dr. Bryan L. Roth, who wrote an analysis of the research that accompanied the articles in The Journal. Dr. Roth is a professor of pharmacology and medicinal chemistry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and director of the psychoactive drug screening program at the National Institute of Mental Health.  Dr. Roth called the risk of valve disease ''extraordinarily high'' and asked: ''Why would you want to subject your patient to this kind of risk? I wouldn't.''  Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which makes Permax, issued a statement by e-mail calling the drug safe and effective for Parkinson's. But Valeant added that it no longer promoted the drug, which was originally made by Eli Lilly.  Dr. Michael Berelowitz, senior vice president of Pfizer, which makes Dostinex, said the company had received fewer than 100 reports of valve problems from the drug, mostly in people with Parkinson's.  The two new reports involve only Parkinson's. The results should not be applied to patients who take Dostinex for the hormone disorder because they take far smaller doses of the drug than do patients with Parkinson's, said Dr. David L. Kleinberg, a professor of medicine and director of the neuroendocrine unit at New York University's medical school.  The hormone disorder affects tens of thousands of people in the United States, mostly women, said Dr. Shlomo Melmed, an endocrinologist and a senior vice president of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Men can develop the disorder, and some need higher doses of Dostinex than do women, Dr. Melmed said, so those men should be monitored for heart valve problems.  Neither drug is a big seller. About 73,000 prescriptions were written for Permax last year, representing $10.5 million in the billion-dollar market for Parkinson's drugs in the United States, according to IMS Health, which tracks drug sales.  About 1.5 million Americans have Parkinson's, according to the National Parkinson Foundation. Dostinex sales in the United States totaled about $88 million in 2005, and about 87,000 prescriptions were written, according to Wolters Kluwer Health, an information company in the Netherlands.  The two new studies are larger than previous ones, and they confirm the higher risk of valve damage in people taking either drug for Parkinson's. The studies also find that the valve problem is more common than initially thought, and that people who took the highest doses for the longest time had the greatest risk.  One study, from the Istituti Clinici di Perfezionamento in Milan, included 155 patients with Parkinson's and found that 23 percent of those taking Permax and 29 percent of those taking Dostinex had damaged heart valves, compared with only almost 6 percent of control subjects not taking the drugs.  The other study, based on the records of more than 11,000 patients with Parkinson's in Britain, found that valve problems were seven times as likely in people taking Permax as in control subjects and five times as likely in those taking Dostinex.  Dr. Roth said the drugs produced the same kind of valve damage caused by the weight loss combination fen-phen, which led to the withdrawal of two drugs, Pondimin and Redux, in 1997. The drugs cause cells to multiply in the heart valves, which causes the valves to thicken so much that they can no longer open and close normally.  Correction:  January 19, 2007, Friday  An article on Jan. 4 about heart-valve problems linked to two drugs for Parkinson's disease misstated the year that one of them, Permax, added a black-box warning label, the strongest warning required by the Food and Drug Administration. It was 2006, not 2003.  ",

                    "text": "  When you play in a tournament that gives out deal records, under every board you see the highest contracts that each side can make in the five strains, assuming the play is double-dummy -- everyone knows where the cards lie. (This is done using Bill Bailey's Deep Finesse software.) Competitors in the Flight A/X Pairs last Saturday at the District 3 Winter Regional in Rye Brook, N.Y., were surprised to see that there was a way to defeat three no-trump by South in the diagramed deal. What leads by West work?  The winners of the Flight A/X Pairs, R. Jay Becker of New York and Bob Sartorius of Lake Hiawatha, N.J., played well and had that necessary slice of luck in this deal.  The event had finished. North and South were itching to leave, not having done well. But they had a late play against Becker and Sartorius, who knew they were in contention. (You get a late play when you take so long to complete the first deal of a round that you do not have time for the final board. Playing that deal is postponed until the end of the session.)  South opened one no-trump, showing 12-14 points. Becker (West) overcalled a natural two hearts. North responded with a natural and forcing three clubs. And South converted to three no-trump.  West, assuming South was prepared for a heart lead, tried our well-known sneak attack with the spade six. East played the three under dummy's jack to show an odd number of spades. (If dummy wins with the ace, king or queen, it is probably best for third hand to signal attitude. But when dummy has only the jack, signaling possession of the ten is surely a waste of time, so giving count is preferable.)  Declarer guessed well, cashing the club ace to drop West's king. Next, he played a club to his queen. Now, knowing that West had the heart king for his bid, South should have led a heart toward dummy's queen. Then South would have won nine tricks: two spades, two hearts and five clubs. And if he had done that, Becker and Sartorius would not have won. Jonathan Green of Kingston, N.Y., and Norman Rubin of Monticello, N.Y., would have taken the title.  But declarer led a diamond to the nine on the board. The defenders took advantage of the opportunity. East won with his ten and returned a spade, West taking South's queen with his king and leading another diamond. East won with his queen and went back to spades, eventually defeating the contract by one trick.  How can the defenders always defeat three no-trump? West must lead a diamond or -- yes -- the club king. Then the defenders have an answer for anything that declarer tries, taking one spade, one heart and three diamonds.  Bridge  ",

                    "text": "  Several Somali Islamist fighters and possibly some of their leaders were arrested trying to escape into Kenya, Kenyan authorities said Wednesday, raising the possibility of a sticky asylum issue.  ''We have detained a number of people, but we are still trying to determine their identities,'' said Alfred Mutua, the spokesman for the Kenyan government.  Somali officials said Kenyan soldiers might have captured Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, the second in command of the defeated Islamist forces.  According to Ismail Qasim Naji, a Somali general, Sheik Sharif's briefcase was recently discovered at a jungle hide-out in southern Somalia.  ''It had some important documents in it,'' General Naji said at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia's seaside capital. When asked what documents, the general replied, ''Top secret.''  Ethiopian-led forces routed Somalia's Islamist army last month after the Islamists attacked Baidoa, the seat of Somalia's transitional government. The American military jumped in last week, bombing two areas in southern Somalia where the Islamist leaders and several terrorist suspects were believed to be hiding. A small contingent of American Special Operations soldiers have been deployed on Somali soil to help track down suspects and identify any bodies.  Since then, the Islamists have been caught between the advancing Ethiopian-led army and the heavily fortified Kenyan border near the Indian Ocean, which is being patrolled by American warships.  United Nations officials said the Kenyan government was deliberating whether to grant Islamist leaders political asylum, in the interest of bringing the fighting across the border to a close by allowing the Islamist leaders a graceful exit from the country. Somalia's transitional government officials have agreed to give amnesty to rank-and-file fighters but said that they wanted the top Islamists handed over to them.  ''Any members of the upper echelons of the Islamists who still pose a threat to our security will face due process of the law in Somalia,'' said Abdirizak Adam Hassan, chief of staff for the transitional president, Abdullahi Yusuf. ''As for terrorists, we will give them to the Americans or the U.N.''  In Baidoa, lawmakers on Wednesday ousted the speaker of Parliament, Sharif Hassan Sheik Adan.  Mr. Adan, an illiterate livestock trader, was recently one of the most powerful men in Somalia. But he fell out of favor with President Yusuf and Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi after he tried to strike a peace deal between the Islamists and the transitional government. He also demanded that Ethiopian troops leave Somalia.  Members of Parliament accused him of being a traitor and voted 183 to 9 to remove him. A replacement has yet to be named.  Mr. Adan rejected the vote, telling a Somali radio station on Wednesday, ''The country is illegally occupied by Ethiopia, and the M.P.s were probably forced to vote against me.''  ",

                    "text": "  With Michigan's new ban on affirmative action going into effect, and similar ballot initiatives looming in other states, many public universities are scrambling to find race-blind ways to attract more blacks and Hispanics.  At Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, a new admissions policy, without mentioning race, allows officials to consider factors like living on an Indian reservation or in mostly black Detroit, or overcoming discrimination or prejudice.  Others are using many different approaches, like working with mostly minority high schools, using minority students as recruiters, and offering summer prep programs for promising students from struggling high schools. Ohio State University, for example, has started a magnet high school with a focus on math and science, to help prepare potential applicants, and sends educators into poor and low-performing middle and elementary schools to encourage children, and their parents, to start planning for college.  Officials across the country have a sense of urgency about the issue in part because Ward Connerly, the black California businessman behind such initiatives in California and Michigan, is planning a kind of Super Tuesday next fall, with ballot initiatives against racial preferences in several states. He is researching possible campaigns in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, and expects to announce next month which states he has chosen.  Ann Korschgen, vice provost at the University of Missouri, said in a recent interview, ''Just this morning, we had a conversation along the line of how we would continue to ensure diversity at our campus if we could not consider race.''  The issue is already heating up in Colorado. This month, two Republican representatives in Colorado asked the state to examine the University of Colorado's spending on diversity, after a libertarian group questioned the expenditures.  Mr. Connerly said that a decade ago, when California passed its ban, Proposition 209, he thought the state was ahead of its time, but that now, he believes ''the country is poised to make a decision about race, about what its place in American life is going to be -- and I really believe the popular vote may be the way to achieve that.''  Both defenders and opponents of affirmative action say the lesson of last fall's campaign in Michigan -- where Proposition 2, banning race and gender preferences in public education, employment and contracting, passed by 58 percent to 42 percent despite strong opposition from government, business, labor, education and religious leaders -- is that such initiatives can succeed almost anywhere.  ''Certain things become popular as state initiatives, like the ban on gay marriages, and restrictions on affirmative action could become one of those things,'' said Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education.  If so, he said, private universities, with their wide discretion in admissions and financial aid, could have a competitive advantage regarding diversity, reshaping the landscape of higher education.  ''Private universities can do whatever they want, consistent with federal law and the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Hartle said. ''Where minority students have a choice between selective public universities that cannot use affirmative action, and selective private universities with strong affirmative action programs, the private universities may seem like the more hospitable places, which would give them an advantage in drawing a diverse student body.''  To many educators, that would be a troubling turnabout.  ''You'd think public universities are charged with special responsibility for ensuring access, but it could come to be exactly the opposite, if there are a lot of these state initiatives,'' said Evan Caminker, the dean of the University of Michigan Law School, adding, ''in terms of public values, it's a big step backward.''  Mr. Connerly is unbothered: If black and Hispanic students are rare at selective universities, the solution is better academic preparation, not special treatment in admissions. ''Every individual should have the same opportunity to compete,'' he said. ''I don't worry about the outcomes.''  Legally, affirmative action has been a moving target. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in cases involving the University of Michigan that race could be one of many factors in admissions, although admissions offices could not give extra points to minority candidates. Many colleges nationwide then moved to ''holistic'' review, considering applicants' ethnicity, but not awarding a set number of points. In states that could face a ballot initiative campaign, though, that standard could fall.  Nationwide, after 30 years of debate, and litigation, over affirmative action, universities have made strikingly little progress toward racially representative student bodies. And recently, with growing awareness that affluent students are vastly overrepresented at selective colleges, the longstanding focus on racial diversity has been joined by a growing concern about economic diversity.  Currently, four states with highly ranked public universities -- California, Florida, Michigan and Washington -- forbid racial preferences, either because of ballot propositions or decisions by elected officials.  Texas banned affirmative action for seven years. The University of Texas resumed consideration of race after the 2003 United States Supreme Court ruling. ''We need every tool we can get,'' concluded Dr. Bruce Walker, the university's director of admissions.  In California and Texas, the first two states to ban racial preferences, underrepresented minorities at the flagship universities declined -- even though both states, and Florida, adopted plans giving a percentage of top high school graduates guaranteed admission to state universities.  In Texas, students admitted through the Top 10 percent plan swamped the flagship Austin campus. But the plan, now being rethought by the Legislature, never brought in many minority students. Last fall, with both race-conscious admissions and the Top 10 plan, blacks made up an all-time high of 5 percent of the freshman class, and Hispanics 19 percent.  A decade after the California ban, only 2 percent of this year's freshmen at the University of California, Los Angeles, are black: a 30-year low. Hispanic representation at U.C.L.A. has dropped, too. At Berkeley, the number of blacks in the freshman class plunged by half the year after the ban, and the number of Hispanics nearly as much.  Systemwide, blacks make up only 3 percent of U.C. freshmen, although about 7 percent of the state's high school graduates are black. Most top black students choose private institutions over state campuses. Over all, of the top third of all students offered admission to the University of California class of 2005, most enrolled and only 19 percent went instead to selective private colleges. But among blacks in that group, 51 percent chose selective private colleges. Meanwhile, up the coast, Stanford University is enrolling more underrepresented minority students. Among this year's freshmen, 11 percent are African-American, up from 8 percent in 1995; Hispanic enrollment has risen, too.  ''Folks look for a place that's comfortable,'' said Richard Shaw, Stanford's admissions dean. ''They want a sense that there's kids like them at the institution.''  The University of Michigan, with other state institutions, tried to win a delay of the ban so it would not hit in the middle of this year's admissions cycle.But the courts rejected this effort, so officials have stopped considering race and gender as factors in admissions, and worry that next year's entering class will be less diverse. Many officials worry that they will lose top minority candidates to selective private universities.  ''We know from colleagues in Texas and California that if we can't take race into account, we're at a competitive disadvantage,'' said Julie Peterson, a spokeswoman for the University of Michigan, where two-thirds of the applicants are from out of state.  Since most of Michigan is overwhelmingly white, said Mary Sue Coleman, the university's president, a plan guaranteeing admission to a percentage of top high school graduates would have little impact, and nothing short of affirmative action will maintain the university's racial diversity.  ''Of course, you want to look at family income, and being the first in the family to attend college and those kinds of factors, of course we do that, but it doesn't get us to a racially diverse student body,'' Dr. Coleman said.  At the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, a program guaranteeing that low-income students can graduate debt-free helped to increase the percentage of blacks in the freshman class to 12 percent, and to increase both economic diversity and the enrollment of underrepresented minority students. Other states have started similar programs.  In Detroit, Wayne State University Law School recently adopted a new admissions policy. Jonathan Weinberg, the professor assigned last year to draft a contingency policy, looked at other states with race-blind admissions and found that instead of race, they look to ''a set of broader diversity concerns that go to socioeconomic status.''  Last month, the faculty adopted his policy, eliminating any mention of race, but broadening the factors the admissions office may consider. Those include being the first in the family to go to college or graduate school; having overcome substantial obstacles, including prejudice and discrimination; being multilingual; and residence abroad, in Detroit or on an Indian reservation.  Frank Wu, the law school's dean, said Wayne State's effort to comply with the law could bring a legal challenge.  ''There's a new fight building,'' Mr. Wu said, ''and that's going to be whether the mere fact that you're striving for diversity means you're somehow trying to get around the ban and find proxies, or pretexts, for race, and that that's impermissible. It's ironic, but in some quarters our effort to adopt a new policy to comply with Prop 2 has been interpreted as an effort to circumvent it.''  Roger Clegg, president of the Council for Equal Opportunity, which opposes racial preferences, said policies like Wayne State's do raise questions.  ''I have a real problem when schools adopt what on their face are race-neutral criteria, if they are doing so to reach a predetermined racial and ethnic goal,'' Mr. Clegg said. ''Both in law and in common sense, the motivation matters.''  At Ohio State University, where admissions are increasingly selective, officials are looking for a long-term answer. ''When we saw what was coming down the road, we started looking to other models, but no other model results in as much diversity,'' said Mabel Freeman, assistant vice president at Ohio State. ''The only long-term solution is to do better in the pipeline and make sure all kids get the best education possible, K-12.''  Correction:  January 31, 2007, Wednesday  A front-page article on Friday about efforts by public colleges to attract minority students misstated the name of the organization headed by Roger Clegg that opposes racial preferences. It is the Center for Equal Opportunity, not the Council for Equal Opportunity.  ",

                    "text": "  Not everyone wants to perform pure traditional gypsy flamenco. A grass-roots genre of flamenco Latino has sprung up in New York in recent years. The program presented by Andrea Del Conte Danza Espa\u00f1a on Thursday night at the Joyce SoHo fits somewhere between those styles, but never created the crucial flamenco feeling of an internal fire reaching up into the soul from the core of the earth.  Ms. Del Conte, an American who trained in ballet before taking on Spanish dancing, was closer to the traditional in her Seguiriyas and Farruca, but without that fire. A sweet-faced, elegant woman, she might have been the youngish director of a school for young dancers. Barbara Martinez, who sang and danced, made something fresh of the Latino style in several numbers. But Marco de Ana was unprepossessing, a major problem for a male flamenco artist, in a company of dancers completed by Mieko Sato and Sol Koeraus.  The musicians were more fun, in an ensemble that included Alfonso Cid, Arturo Martinez, Cristian Puig and Sean Kupisz. The evening's choreographers included Juana Cala and Jos\u00e9 Galvan.  Andrea Del Conte Danza Espa\u00f1a performs through tomorrow night at the Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets; (212) 334-7479.  DANCE REVIEW  ",

                    "text": "  FOR years, the noise, vibration and fumes from Long Island Rail Road trains idling on a track siding in the Village of Patchogue have been a nuisance to residents. But after the installation of an automated signal system last May, the idling trains are now virtually in some residents' backyards.  Jack Eddington, a Suffolk County legislator whose district includes Patchogue, said a six-foot chain-link fence is all that separates the trains from the backyards of homeowners on Academy Street.  ''The trains are literally 10 feet from their homes,'' he said.  Ann M. Goodhue, who lives on the opposite side of Academy Street, said she found the ''train situation atrocious.'' She said vibrations from three trains that sat idling on the siding several years ago cracked her second-floor ceiling.  Mr. Eddington said he had been at the siding when two trains were idling and found the noise very loud. ''And they give off a diesel smell,'' he said.  Until several years ago, the siding was about a mile west in a commercial area. Mr. Eddington said complaints from residents were fewer because a lumberyard and a bowling alley were on either side of the tracks and homes were far from the idling trains. But about six years ago, he said, trains were instructed to idle about three-quarters of a mile to the east, ''and it became a general nuisance because it was almost right in the middle of town.''  When a new signal system was installed last May about 200 to 300 feet farther east to align with a switch for the tracks, train engineers were instructed to idle there, said Susan McGowan, a railroad spokeswoman.  Mr. Eddington said that change put the trains ''right along the backyards of 12 or 13 homes'' on Academy Street.  ''I want the railroad to do the right thing'' for the residents, he said. ''I have looked up and down the track, and I see areas that don't have homes. I'm not telling them where they should go, but what I am saying is that where they are now is not acceptable.''  Ms. McGowan said that in an effort to ''minimize the inconvenience,'' the railroad had relocated two of six weekday trains that use the siding. One was moved 10 to 20 feet to the north siding, and a second was moved to a siding in Speonk.  ''These are the first steps we have taken,'' she said. ''We're continuing to look at the situation.''

                    "text": "  China and Russia vetoed an American-drafted resolution on Friday calling for the military rulers of Myanmar to release all political prisoners, cease attacks on ethnic minorities and speed a transition to democracy.  The vote was 9 to 3 with South Africa joining China and Russia in opposition, and three other countries, Congo Republic, Indonesia and Qatar, abstaining.  The Security Council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- hold veto power over most resolutions.  China and Russia argued that they shared concerns about conditions in Myanmar but considered them internal matters that did not constitute threats to international peace and security, the category of crisis subject to Security Council action.  ''Not a single one of the neighboring countries regards the situation in Myanmar as a threat to them, and on the basis of that, there were no grounds for the Security Council to consider the matter,'' said Vitaly I. Churkin, Russia's ambassador.  Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said, ''Of course there are problems in Myanmar, but we believe that these problems do not constitute a threat to international peace and security.''  Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting American ambassador, said he was ''deeply disappointed'' at the outcome but noted even countries voting against the measure made clear in explanatory statements that they were not defending Myanmar's government. ''This was a jurisdictional issue behind the split vote here,'' he said. ''There was no disagreement about the content and substance behind this resolution.''  Mr. Wolff was asked why the United States risked dividing the Council and muddling its message to the repressive rulers of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.  ''The only mixed message here is whether this issue deserved to be on the Security Council agenda,'' he said. ''There is no mixed message, no mixed signal at all, about how the international community, how this Council feels about the situation in Burma.''  The resolution mentioned by name the most prominent political prisoner, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader, who is under house arrest.  It also accused Myanmar's armed forces of attacking and raping civilians from the country's ethnic minorities and causing a refugee crisis in the region, enabling narcotics traffic and permitting international transmission of communicable diseases like H.I.V./AIDS and avian flu.  R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said he had no doubt that the abuses by Myanmar posed a threat beyond its borders. ''When a million people flee the country because of the abusive practices of the government, that's a threat to international peace and security,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington.  ''When you have a political movement jailed,'' he said, ''led by a woman who is one of the greatest people in the world, that's a threat to international peace and security.''  He dismissed suggestions that the proper United Nations forum for Myanmar was the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, not the Security Council. ''We forced this onto the agenda for one reason,'' he said. ''The Security Council is the only place that can deal with human rights. The Human Rights Council is a discredited institution. All it has done is to bash Israel; it has ignored North Korea, it has ignored Sudan and it has ignored Burma.''  After the vote, Kyaw Tint Swe, Myanmar's ambassador, thanked China and Russia for blocking the move and said the charges against his country in the resolution were ''patently false.''  The double veto was the first multiple veto in the Security Council since 1989, when Britain, France and the United States blocked a resolution on Panama.  ",

                    "text": "  Indianapolis (13-4)  at Baltimore (13-3)  4:30 p.m., Channel 2  This is the Colts' first playoff game in Baltimore since the franchise abandoned the city 23 years ago.  Peyton Manning can counter the Ravens' heralded defense by passing quickly from short drops or handing off to the rookie Joseph Addai. ''We never feel we can go anyplace and not move the ball,'' Colts Coach Tony Dungy said.  But the Ravens' offense has come a long way since Brian Billick fired Jim Fassel as offensive coordinator and took over himself. Steve McNair looks like the McNair of old.  The Colts have lost four straight games on the road, where Manning is 1-4 in playoff games. The Ravens have won four games in a row and 9 of their past 10.  Reporter's Pick: Ravens  Philadelphia (11-6)  at New Orleans (10-6)  8 p.m., Channel 5  The Eagles have the playoff experience and momentum. Most of the Saints have never been to the playoffs, but they have game-breakers on offense, a smart new coach in Sean Payton and a feel-good story.  The Eagles have won six in a row with Jeff Garcia at quarterback, and Brian Westbrook, with his elusive running, is no longer a hidden treasure. The offense must carry the Saints, and the weapons are there in quarterback Drew Brees, Reggie Bush, Deuce McAllister and receivers Joe Horn and Marques Colston.  The Eagles must contend without Lito Sheppard, the Pro Bowl cornerback who has a dislocated elbow. That makes the Saints' offense even more dangerous.  Reporter's Pick: Saints  Seattle (10-7)  at Chicago (13-3)  1 p.m., Channel 5  Both teams have problems at quarterback. When the Bears overwhelmed the Seahawks three months ago, they sacked Matt Hasselbeck five times and had two interceptions. Hasselbeck has 10 interceptions in his past 7 games.  Shaun Alexander's running has carried the load for the Seahawks, but as he said, ''Our offense has some things to do.'' So does the injury-riddled defense, but it may get unintended help from Rex Grossman, who had a passer rating of 0 in the Bears' season finale.  The Bears have been able to afford his bad days because they run well and their defense is good. But that defense is showing signs of weakness, yielding 300 or more yards in each of the past six games.  Reporter's Pick: Bears  New England (13-4)  at San Diego (14-2)  4:30 p.m., Channel 2  This could be the best game of the playoffs. The Chargers have been the league's strongest team and have the best record. The Patriots have won three Super Bowl titles in the past five years.  The Patriots have won seven of their past eight games and are 7-1 on the road. They will need a big game from quarterback Tom Brady to counter Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson, who led the league with 1,815 rushing yards and an N.F.L.-record 31 touchdowns.  ''We're usually looking at the back of his jersey,'' Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said. ''He's killed a lot of people besides us, and he's killed us.''  The Chargers have won 10 in a row and are playing at home, where they are 8-0.  Reporter's Pick: Chargers  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  The new health care proposals announced by President Bush this week purport to tackle the two toughest problems confronting the American health care system: the rising number of uninsured Americans and the escalating costs of medical care.  But on both counts, they fall miles short of what is needed to fix a system where -- scandalously -- 47 million Americans go without health insurance.  The financial sinkhole in Iraq and huge tax cuts for wealthy Americans have left the administration with no money to really address the problem. To keep the program ''revenue neutral,'' Mr. Bush would instead use tax subsidies to encourage more people to buy their own health insurance, while imposing additional taxes on people who have what Mr. Bush deems ''gold plated'' insurance.  It is a formula that would do little to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and would have a high risk of producing pernicious results. Even White House officials acknowledged earlier this week that they expected the number of uninsured to drop by only three million to five million people as a result of Mr. Bush's proposals. They expect the states to take on most of the burden.  One enlightened element is that the plan would provide equal tax treatment to those who bought their insurance policies on the individual market and those who got coverage through group policies at work, thus ending a longstanding inequity that favors employer-based policies. To level the playing field, the administration proposes to grant everyone who gets qualifying health insurance a standard deduction -- $15,000 for family coverage or $7,500 for single coverage -- off their income subject to taxation. Those with family policies exceeding $15,000 in value would have to pay taxes on the excess amount.  After the proposed starting date in 2009, the administration estimates, about 80 percent of workers with employer-provided policies would pay lower taxes and 20 percent would pay higher taxes, unless they reduced the value of their health coverage to fit within the standard deduction.  The new standard deduction would almost certainly entice some people to buy health insurance who had previously elected not to. But a tax deduction is of little value to people so poor that they pay little or no income tax. And unfortunately, it is those people who account for the vast majority of the nation's uninsured.  Instead of trying to fix that fundamental flaw, the administration has decided instead to buck it to the states. The White House has offered few details. But its idea is to allow states to redirect federal money that now helps to finance hospitals that provide charity care and use it instead to subsidize health insurance for the poor.  In an ideal world, it would make good sense to insure people in advance rather than wait for them to show up in a high-cost emergency room. But this plan could quickly cripple the safety-net hospitals. Fortunately, no governor would have to accept the offer to redirect funds. The scheme is mostly a reflection of how the administration is unwilling to accept true responsibility for the uninsured.  If the administration really wanted to help low-income people, it would have proposed a refundable tax credit that would have the same dollar value for everyone -- instead of a tax deduction, which primarily helps people in high tax brackets. Even those who do not pay taxes would get a check for the dollar value of the credit, providing them at least some money to help pay for health insurance. Congress ought to recognize that credits are the better approach for even such a limited plan.  As for the tax increases on those ''gold plated'' health policies, the White House is hoping to discourage people from using high-priced comprehensive health policies that cover everything from routine office visits to costly diagnostic procedures that are not always necessary.  The administration's goal is to instead encourage people to take out policies that might reduce the use of medical services, like policies with high deductibles or co-payments, or managed care plans. But even ''copper plated'' policies can exceed $15,000 in cost if they are issued in areas where medical prices are high or to groups with high numbers of older or chronically ill workers.  The whole approach rests on the premise that comprehensive prepaid health policies are a major factor in driving up costs; the theory is that people will tend to use services if they are covered. There is probably some truth in that.  But the main drivers in rising health costs are the costly services, high-priced drugs and hospitalizations for people who are seriously ill with catastrophic diseases or multiple chronic illnesses. Making their health coverage less generous would simply make it harder for them to get the care they need.  The greatest risk in the president's proposal is that it would seem likely to lead many small- and medium-size employers to stop offering health benefits altogether on the theory that their workers could buy affordable insurance on their own. That would leave many more Americans at the mercy of the dysfunctional individual policy market, where administrative costs are high and insurers strive to avoid covering people who are apt to become sick and need costly care.  For all its fanfare, Mr. Bush's plan would be unlikely to reduce the ranks of the uninsured very much. And if things went badly, it could actually increase their numbers. That's not the answer Americans are waiting for and not what they deserve.  Editorial  ",

                    "text": "  Move over, gas-electric hybrid. Ford has a new entry, the electric-electric hybrid.  The vehicle, based on a Ford Edge crossover, runs on electricity from a battery, charged either from a standard wall socket or from an on-board fuel cell. It has two highly visible fueling ports, both on the driver's side of the vehicle. One is a hose coupling for hydrogen gas, and the other is an electric connection like the one on a leaf blower, ready for a standard three-prong extension cord.  ''I told the design team to make them prominent,'' said Mujeeb I. Ijaz, the manager of fuel-cell vehicle engineering at Ford.  Energy specialists say they think the plug-in hybrid could cut oil dependence by allowing a car to go the first 25 or 30 miles each day on energy drawn from the power grid, most of which is generated from coal. That would cover the entire commute of most drivers on most days.  But almost all plug-in hybrid designs have a gasoline engine as a backup, to provide range. The plug-in Edge is the first to use a fuel cell instead, according to Ford.  Marrying a fuel cell to a battery allows the fuel cell to run at a constant rate, which is gentler on the hardware than having it cycle up to its maximum when the car is accelerating and then down to nothing. And it means that the fuel cell can be much smaller, because it does not need to be sized to handle maximum load.  The plug-in hybrid Edge has a 35-kilowatt fuel cell and a 130-kilowatt electric motor drive.  Mr. Ijaz said that fuel cells were less expensive than they used to be, but were still near $1,000 for a kilowatt of capacity, about 10 times the price of a kilowatt from a battery, and 30 times the price of a kilowatt from a gasoline engine.  The finished product (of which there is exactly one) illustrates the economics of hydrogen. At $5 a kilo of hydrogen (which is the selling price at a demonstration fueling station here, but probably far below actual cost), a dollar's worth will push the Edge about eight miles. But a consumer who charged the batteries at 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, roughly the national average retail price, would go 25 miles on a dollar's worth.  (A gasoline vehicle that gets 20 miles a gallon on unleaded regular at $2.25 a gallon would go a little less than 9 miles on a dollar's worth.)  The Edge was built as an experiment, not as a money-saver. Partly financed by the Energy Department, it cost about $2 million. The assistant secretary of energy for conservation and renewables, Andrew Karsner, is scheduled to appear at the Washington Auto Show on Tuesday to discuss the Edge and other vehicles.  Among its disadvantages is a hydrogen tank that takes up about seven times as much space as a gasoline tank that would provide the same useable energy.  The Edge has switches that allow the driver to plan a trip and do the last few miles on battery, with the fuel cell shut down, to maximize use of electricity from the grid, not from hydrogen. The tailpipe emits only low-temperature water vapor. On Sunday afternoon, at 32 degrees, as Ford raced to get photos of the vehicle before the snow started, Mr. Ijaz aptly described the tailpipe as looking like a dryer vent. In warmer weather the vapor would not be so visible.  Running in cold weather has another complication; the Edge uses electric resistance heat, supplemented by waste heat from the fuel-cell stack. The air-conditioner is also electric. Both cut slightly into range. With fuel compressed to 5,000 pounds per square inch, range is 200 miles (plus 25 miles on electricity stored from the initial battery charge); Ford, like the rest of the fuel-cell industry, plans to shift to fuel cells that use hydrogen stored at 10,000 p.s.i.  In city and highway traffic, the car, like most electrics, has no vibration, and the tire sounds are prominent because there is no engine noise to mask them. The sound of a compressor that pumps air through the fuel cell is also prominent.  ",

''I am running for president,'' Mr. Biden said toward the end of an appearance on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC.  ''I'm going to be Joe Biden, and I'm going to try to be the best Biden I can be,'' he said. ''If I can, I got a shot. If I can't, I lose.''  He said he would file paperwork by the end of the month to establish an exploratory committee to gather support for his bid.  Mr. Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972, also sought the presidential nomination in 1988. But he dropped out of the race after admitting that he had used speeches by other politicians without attribution, and after reports that he had plagiarized while in law school.  Mr. Biden, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, joins a widening field of Democratic presidential hopefuls. The others who have officially announced their candidacies are former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa.  Other potential Democratic contenders include Senators Hilary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois. Among Republicans, Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, are expected to run.  ",

                    "text": "  Botnet programs and other malicious software largely take aim at PCs running the Microsoft Windows operating system, because Windows' ubiquity makes it fertile ground for network-based attacks.  Using a non-Windows-based PC may be one defense against these programs, known as malware; also, anti-malware programs and antivirus utilities for the PC are available from several vendors. Windows users should use the Windows update feature.  Microsoft itself entered the computer-security business last year and now offers a free malware-removal tool for download from its Web site. The company says the program removes about two million pieces of malware each month, of which 200,000, or about 10 percent, are botnet infections.  Like Windows, Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is also a large, convenient target for code-writing vandals. Alternative browsers, like Firefox and Opera, may insulate users. Microsoft's most recent browser release, Internet Explorer 7, is said to offer significantly improved defenses.  Adding software to your browser like Noscript, a plug-in utility, can limit the ability of remote programs to run potentially damaging programs on your PC.  Security experts also offer these tips:  Don't share your computer (on which you pay your bills) with your children (who download games).  Use a firewall program that warns you about outgoing connections that botnets make to communicate with control software.  Don't use the same password on more than one financial site.  Don't let your browser store your password for such sites.  Don't buy anything offered by a spammer.  Don't click if someone offers you something too good to be true. It is.  JOHN MARKOFF  ",

                    "text": "  New Orleans Saints (11-6) at Chicago Bears (14-3)  3 p.m., Fox  The Saints have never reached the National Football Conference championship game. No team with a record as bad as the Saints' 3-13 last season had ever made the conference championship the next season. But here are the Saints, and, tailback Deuce McAllister said, ''This may be destiny.''  It may be many things, but two stand out:  Can the Bears' celebrated defense rise from the doldrums and handle McAllister, quarterback Drew Brees, the all-around threat Reggie Bush and those dangerous receivers?  Which Rex Grossman will show up at quarterback for the Bears?  Last week, Grossman was mostly good in an overtime victory against the Seahawks, and the Saints' secondary has been vulnerable to the long pass. Grossman was erratic during the regular season, with 23 touchdown passes and 20 interceptions. ''What's important is those players have a belief in him,'' Saints Coach Sean Payton said.  Although the Bears' defense has lost some of its dominance because of injuries, linebacker Lance Briggs said, ''We tweak a little, we're right back where we were.''  The Bears will have an advantage from a home crowd, and Chicago weather in January can be shocking to a dome team from a warm-weather city.  Reporter's Pick: Saints  New England (14-4) at Indianapolis (14-4)  6:30 p.m., CBS  History favors the Patriots. They have won three of the last five Super Bowls, Coach Bill Belichick is 13-2 in playoff games and quarterback Tom Brady is 12-1. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is 4-10 against the Patriots. In two playoff games this season, he has thrown one touchdown pass and five interceptions.  Or maybe history will favor the Colts in the American Football Conference title game. They beat the Patriots 11 weeks ago, when Brady threw four interceptions, and he threw three last week against the Chargers.  Still, the Patriots have won five straight games, and they always seem to come up with defensive innovations. They will need offensive fire because the Colts, who have suffered on defense all season, have turned into a defensive power.  Reporter's Pick: Patriots  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  The main international scientific body assessing causes of climate change is closing in on its strongest statement yet linking emissions from burning fossil fuels to rising global temperatures, according to scientists involved in the process.  In fresh drafts of a summary of its next report, the group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  has said that it is more than 90 percent likely that global warming since 1950 has been driven mainly by the buildup of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and that more warming and rising sea levels are on the way.  Some scientists involved in drafting the report confirmed and clarified details but asked not to be identified because it was not finished.  In its last report, published in 2001, the panel concluded that there was a 66 to 90 percent chance that human activities were driving the most recent warming.  The shift in language in the current draft, while subtle, is substantive. If it remains in the final version, scheduled for release in Paris on Feb. 2, it will largely complete a quest that lasted decades to determine if humans are nudging the earth's thermostat in potentially momentous ways.  Drafts of the report project a most likely warming of 4 to 8 degrees if the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises to twice the 280 parts per million that it averaged for many centuries before the Industrial Revolution.  The carbon dioxide concentration is now roughly 380 parts per million, and many climate experts say it will be extremely difficult to avoid hitting levels of 450 or 550 parts per million, or higher, later this century, given growth in populations and fuel use and the lack of nonpolluting alternatives that can be exploited at a sufficient scale to replace fossil fuels.  Because the panel works under the auspices of the United Nations, dozens of officials from governments around the world have been critiquing drafts, and details inevitably begin to slip into the press in the weeks preceding the formal release.  Snippets of earlier drafts have leaked to some newspapers in recent months and some sections of the latest draft were first published in The Toronto Star yesterday.  Scientists involved in writing the report said the leaks were damaging and potentially misleading, mainly because the final statements are likely to go through further changes.  ''The language is far from final,'' said Kevin E. Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who is a lead author of one section. ''You can't say what the I.P.C.C. says until it actually says it.''  ",

According to Nielsen's estimates, ''Prison Break'' matched a season's best 9.9 million viewers at 8 p.m., while the sixth hour of ''24'' earned 14 million viewers to lead the 9 p.m. hour in total viewers ahead of NBC's ''Heroes'' (13.6 million). ''Heroes'' did remain the night's highest-rated show in the 18 to 49 demographic, ahead of second-place ''24.'' For the night, NBC outdrew Fox by a half million total viewers. Its game show at 8, ''Deal or No Deal,'' claimed the title of most-watched show on Monday (16.9 million), but the 10 o'clock hour remained NBC's weakest, as ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' attracted 7 million viewers opposite a repeat of CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (13.4 million). CBS broadcast reruns of its comedy lineup from 8 to 10 and finished third over all. ABC was fourth, despite new episodes of ''Supernanny'' at 9 (8.7 million) and ''What About Brian'' at 10 (5.7 million).  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

                    "text": "  When Destiny-Rae was quiet at 18 months old, Delores Pryce knew that something was wrong. ''All my children talked early,'' she said. ''But she wasn't speaking.''  The problem, as Ms. Pryce discovered, was that her daughter could not hear. The fluid in her ears was not draining properly. An operation to install tubes to drain the fluid in each ear solved the hearing problem.  Today, as she turns 7 years old, Destiny-Rae is a chatty, bubbly first grader who likes to read. ''I read all kinds of books,'' she said.  Destiny-Rae's premature birth came with medical complications and a wrenching change of address that turned the lives of Ms. Pryce, now 43, and her family upside down.  In December 1999, Ms. Pryce was pregnant with Destiny-Rae and visiting New York with her three children, Misty-Lee, Keano-Ross and Marie-Chantal, then ages 3 through 10. She was on vacation from her native England after fleeing a tumultuous marriage. She had planned to return home shortly after the new year.  On Jan. 4, 2000, Destiny-Rae was born two months early. ''When she came out she was red and then, all of a sudden, she turned blue,'' Ms. Pryce remembered. ''She wasn't able to breathe.''  Destiny-Rae spent 16 days in the hospital and was released weighing little more than four pounds. Ms. Pryce was stranded in New York with four children, one of them a fragile newborn.  ''The hospital wouldn't let me fly home,'' she said.  The family was staying with friends, but the arrangement soured, leaving the entire Pryce family homeless. Ms. Pryce gathered her children and entered a Brooklyn shelter.  Destiny-Rae was in and out of Kings County Hospital Center five times before her first birthday, for pneumonia and other complications. Ms. Pryce and her three children traveled by subway from their Brooklyn shelter to visit her daily. The family lived in a shelter during the next four years. Destiny-Rae had emotional and behavioral issues, including hyperactivity, a sensitivity to touch and a quick temper.  Then, in September 2004, Tabernacle Church in Jamaica, Queens, offered a lifeline. Ms. Pryce had been a member of the Baptist congregation for three years. The church offered her a small two-bedroom apartment above its small worship space and set the rent at $250 a month.  ''It looked like a bomb hit it,'' Ms. Pryce said. ''We cleaned it up. We did our bit.'' The apartment today is furnished with worn, hand-me-down furniture. Amy and Patrick, the family parakeets, fly around the living room.  Destiny-Rae pointed to two paper certificates for perfect school attendance in October. ''This is Misty's perfect attendance; this is mine,'' she said.  Ms. Pryce lives here with Destiny-Rae and Misty-Lee, 10, who is in fifth grade. Her eldest daughter, 17, is in college in England, where students typically start college classes at 16. Her son, Keano-Ross, is living there with Ms. Pryce's parents and doing well in fourth grade.  The apartment was a huge step toward stability, but paying the electricity bill was a new hurdle.  ''They sent me a bill when I first came here and I paid that bill,'' Ms. Pryce remembered.  Then, she said, Consolidated Edison sent no bills for months. The Con Ed office is across the street from Destiny-Rae's weekly play therapy, and Ms. Pryce said that she inquired there regularly about her bill. She was told that Con Ed did not have her account information. About a year and a half later, she received a $1,600 electricity bill.  The family income is limited to $626 a month from Destiny's Supplemental Security income and supplemented by $152 in food stamps, and a $20 stipend from the church food pantry, where Ms. Pryce also volunteers twice a week. She also picks up baby-sitting jobs, and works one day a week at a neighborhood grocery.  Ms. Pryce managed to pay $500 toward the electric bill. But in October, Con Ed threatened to remove the meter, and she asked for help to pay the remaining balance.  She turned to Keiko Aizawa, a social worker at New Alternatives for Children, which provides preventive services for families with medically fragile children. The program is run by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  Ms. Aizawa, who has been involved with the family since Destiny-Rae's ear surgery more than five years ago, found money to pay off the remaining $1,100 on the electricity bill, $500 of which was Neediest Cases money.  ''You guys came through for me. I'm not going back in the shelter,'' said Ms. Pryce, who is grateful for Ms. Aizawa's continued support.  Things are looking up. Destiny-Rae receives physical, occupational and speech therapy each week and is catching up academically. ''By the age of 8 or 9, she should be up to par and out of special ed,'' Ms. Aizawa said.  Ms. Pryce hopes to find a full-time job now that two of her girls are in school here, and she said that she is finally beginning to feel more secure.  ''I've got the sense that I'm safe here,'' she said. ''Everything will be all right. They've got better as things have gone along.''  In her bedroom, Misty-Lee pulled out some princess decorations and pink paper wall hangings that Ms. Aizawa gave the girls a few months ago. ''We're going to put it up soon,'' she said.

Correction:  January 18, 2007, Thursday  An article on Jan. 4 about Delores Pryce, a Queens woman whose youngest daughter has health problems and who received help from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to help pay an electricity bill, referred incorrectly to New Alternatives for Children, a program that helps families with medically fragile children. (The error was repeated in an article on Jan. 5 about Dorcas Acheampong, a Bronx woman who received help from the fund to help pay her rent.) Although it is a member agency of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, it is not run by the federation.  ",

                    "text": "  Universal health care, much as we need it, won't happen until there's a change of management in the White House. In the meantime, however, Congress can take an important step toward making our health care system less wasteful, by fixing the Medicare Middleman Multiplication Act of 2003.  Officially, of course, it was the Medicare Modernization Act. But as we learned during the debate over Social Security, in Bushspeak ''modernize'' is a synonym for ''privatize.'' And one of the main features of the legislation was an effort to bring private-sector fragmentation and inefficiency to one of America's most important public programs.  The process actually started in the 1990s, when Medicare began allowing recipients to replace traditional Medicare -- in which the government pays doctors and hospitals -- with private managed-care plans, in which the government pays a fee to an H.M.O. The magic of the marketplace was supposed to cut Medicare's costs.  The plan backfired. H.M.O.'s received fees reflecting the medical costs of the average Medicare recipient, but to maximize profits they selectively enrolled only healthier seniors, leaving sicker, more expensive people in traditional Medicare. Once Medicare became aware of this cream-skimming and started adjusting payments to reflect beneficiaries' health, the H.M.O.'s began dropping out: their extra layer of bureaucracy meant that they had higher costs than traditional Medicare and couldn't compete on a financially fair basis.  That should have been the end of the story. But for the Bush administration and its Congressional allies, privatization isn't a way to deliver better government services -- it's an end in itself. So the 2003 legislation increased payments to Medicare-supported H.M.O.'s, which were renamed Medicare Advantage plans. These plans are now heavily subsidized.  According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal body that advises Congress on Medicare issues, Medicare Advantage now costs 11 percent more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare. According to the Commonwealth Fund, which has a similar estimate of the excess cost, the subsidy to private H.M.O.'s cost Medicare $5.4 billion in 2005.  The inability of private middlemen to win a fair competition against traditional Medicare was embarrassing to those who sing the praises of privatization. Maybe that's why the Bush administration made sure that there is no competition at all in Part D, the drug program. There's no traditional Medicare version of Part D, in which the government pays drug costs directly. Instead, the elderly must get coverage from a private insurance company, which then receives a government subsidy.  As a result, Part D is highly confusing. It's also needlessly expensive, for two reasons: the insurance companies add an extra layer of bureaucracy, and they have limited ability to bargain with drug companies for lower prices (and Medicare is prohibited from bargaining on their behalf). One indicator of how much Medicare is overspending is the sharp rise in prices paid by millions of low-income seniors whose drug coverage has been switched from Medicaid, which doesn't rely on middlemen and does bargain over prices, to the new Medicare program.  The costs imposed on Medicare by gratuitous privatization are almost certainly higher than the cost of providing health insurance to the eight million children in the United States who lack coverage. But recent news analyses have suggested that Democrats may not be able to guarantee coverage to all children because this would conflict with their pledge to be fiscally responsible. Isn't it strange how fiscal responsibility is a big concern when Congress is trying to help children, but a nonissue when Congress is subsidizing drug and insurance companies?  What should Congress do? The new Democratic majority is poised to reduce drug prices by allowing -- and, probably, requiring -- Medicare to negotiate prices on behalf of the private drug plans. But it should go further, and force Medicare to offer direct drug coverage that competes on a financially fair basis with the private plans. And it should end the subsidy to Medicare Advantage, forcing H.M.O.'s to engage in fair competition with traditional Medicare.  Conservatives will fight fiercely against these moves. They say they believe in competition -- but they're against competition that might show the public sector doing a better job than the private sector. Progressives should support these moves for the same reason. Ending the subsidies to middlemen, in addition to saving a lot of money, would point the way to broader health care reform.

                    "text": "  ABC sees fewer ongoing, serialized dramas in its future, and at least one of its biggest shows -- the megahit ''Lost'' -- is heading toward a definite end.  Stephen McPherson, the president of ABC Entertainment, told a meeting of television writers here on Sunday that after the experience of several failed or mediocre new serials this year -- including ''Day Break,'' ''The Nine'' and ''Six Degrees'' -- the network has fewer of those types of shows in development.  And for ''Lost,'' the biggest of the ABC serials, the network is now discussing with the producers how and when to end the series, Mr. McPherson said.  Damon Lindelof, one of the executive producers of ''Lost,'' said that the show's creators had always viewed it as lasting about 100 episodes, and that he still believes that will be the case. Fifty-three episodes have been broadcast so far, with the show in its third season, meaning that it is likely that the fifth season will be the last.  ''We're no longer going up the hill,'' Mr. Lindelof said. ''We're starting to come down now.''  Mr. Lindelof also said that while ABC has the ability to extend the series as long as it wants, with different producers and even different stars, he believes that the network is unlikely to do so.  ''We don't want to produce those episodes of 'Lost,' and we are not going to,'' Mr. Lindelof said. He cautioned against such a move, pointing out that as series like ''The X-Files'' and ''Alias'' extended their runs by making dubious creative decisions, their ratings suffered greatly as fans abandoned the shows in droves.  He said the network and the producers would announce the decision soon after it is made, to make sure that fans understand that the show has a definite endpoint, and that outstanding questions about the mysteries of the island will be answered.  But there also was some good news for ''Lost'' fans.  Mr. McPherson said it is unlikely that viewers will have to weather another extended midseason hiatus. The network has been criticized by fans for running six ''Lost'' episodes last fall, then breaking for almost three months before resuming the series next month for 16 straight weeks.  Mr. McPherson said he believes that the next season will run for 22 consecutive weeks, either in the fall of 2007 or the spring of 2008. Production requirements and scheduling necessities caused ABC to break up the series this season, he said.  ABC also said it will present a fourth season of ''Dancing With the Stars,'' its hit ballroom-dance competition, on Monday nights beginning on March 19. The network decided not to schedule the competition installments of the series directly against ''American Idol,'' which runs on Tuesday nights, although the results show for ''Dancing'' will be seen at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, going up against at least a portion of ''Idol'' on some nights.  As for future serial shows Mr. McPherson said that the experience of the network's current season, with several bad showings for new serials, indicated that audiences have a limited ability to absorb such shows. After the initial success of ''Lost'' and Fox's ''24'' several years ago, a lot of television production companies put new serials into development, with many of them on at the same time, as they did this year.  ''We're going to see an adjustment this year because people in the fall were able to see whether or not there was a burnout,'' Mr. McPherson said. ''We're seeing a little bit of a shift away from that.''  ",

                    "text": "  Two years before the next president is inaugurated and a full year before the first vote is cast, the contest for the White House is off to a breathtakingly fast start, exposing an ever-growing field of candidates to longer, more intensive scrutiny and increasing the amount of money they need to remain viable.  On Sunday, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, held her first campaign event, highlighting her focus on health care a day after declaring her plans to run. Another Democrat, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, entered the fray, the eighth member of his party to do so. And the day was not terribly different in its pace of activity from many others in recent weeks.  The scale and swiftness of the action has the potential to upset the traditional timetables and conventions of presidential campaigning.  John Weaver, a senior adviser to Senator John McCain's presidential effort, said the intensified announcement season and compressed primary calendar would force campaigns to develop a strong national apparatus and well-organized field efforts state by state.  ''It makes it nearly impossible for a dark horse candidate to break out of the pack and challenge the front-runner(s) and thus isn't healthy for the process,'' Mr. Weaver wrote in an e-mail message on Sunday. ''All of these states, who are moving up early, want to play and have an impact. But oddly enough, it ultimately will limit the legitimate candidate choices for the nation at large in the primary process.''  The candidates could be forced to move more quickly to take positions on big issues, stripping them of the chance to run on more gauzy platforms in the early stages and therefore exposing them to more direct criticism from rivals, interest groups and the news media. They will face earlier encounters with one another -- New Hampshire and South Carolina are planning full-scale debates this spring -- that will require them to display both policy expertise and a comfort level in front of the cameras.  They will be getting intensive scrutiny from opposition research operations, the news media and the public for that much longer, increasing the chances that a gaffe or position change could harm their campaigns. Deep into competition for experienced staff members, most candidates are already putting together operations in multiple states.  Kevin Madden, press secretary for the exploratory committee set up by former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, a Republican, said his organization was already ''beginning to put our teams together'' for the early contests in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, Michigan and several states beyond. ''It's happened at a very advanced pace,'' Mr. Madden said, ''but you can't complain and wring your hands. You just have to work harder, faster.''  Because they do not want competitors to be raising money unchallenged, more candidates are declaring their intentions earlier, which in turn means the entire field needs more money to sustain campaigns for a longer time.  There are now a dozen serious contenders from both parties competing in a presidential race that for the first time in more than half a century will not include an incumbent -- either the president or the vice president -- on the ballot or even a definitive front-runner.  ''Crowded fields force early announcements,'' said Jennifer Palmieri, an adviser to John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina who is seeking the Democratic nomination. ''Candidates are concerned there will not be enough oxygen left for them if they wait too long. Having crowded fields in both parties has exacerbated this phenomenon.''  Just hours after Mrs. Clinton made her candidacy official on Saturday, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas joined the race for the Republican nomination. Last week, Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, opened a presidential exploratory committee, emphasizing the wide-open nature of the race.  The early start of the presidential race may make it difficult for the new Democratic leaders in Congress to generate public support and media attention for their agenda. Seven sitting members of the House and Senate have declared their candidacies and several others are said to be considering it, distracting them from legislative business and drawing news coverage away from Congress and out onto the campaign trail.  John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton and president of the Center for American Progress, said some of the early candidates surely recall the lesson of Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the Democrat who waited to jump into the last presidential race until the fall of 2003.  Given the lateness of his entry, and his limited resources, General Clark decided to skip the Iowa caucuses and focus on the New Hampshire primary. Iowa became an unexpectedly fierce contest, with John Kerry emerging as a winner and quickly rolling on to victories in New Hampshire and other early primary states.  ''You need to get a foothold early and organize and get people to rally around you and your message,'' Mr. Podesta said, ''and the need to build momentum is real.''  The candidates and the early primary states are chasing each other in a mad circle, with two new states, Nevada and South Carolina, squeezing into the first weeks of the primary calendar. A number of other states, including California, New Jersey, Michigan and Illinois, are considering moving up their primaries so that they are not left out of the nominating process. With their expensive media markets, these states could quickly bankrupt candidates who have trouble raising money.  The intensity of the early action is fueled in part by President Bush's political weakness, brought on largely because of the unpopularity of the war in Iraq.  ''If Bush were doing well and had a continuing ability to get things done and command the national stage, I think there would be far less focus on the campaign,'' said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian.  While presidential campaigns have been getting gradually longer over the past few decades, the acceleration in the 2008 cycle is particularly pronounced. The first President Bush announced his candidacy for the 1988 Republican nomination in October 1987; the eventual Democratic nominee in that election, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, had declared six months earlier.  Bill Clinton formally announced his candidacy for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination on Oct. 3, 1991, about three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses. George W. Bush announced his exploratory committee for the 2000 presidential race in March 1999 and began his campaign in June 1999.  By comparison, Mr. Edwards of North Carolina, the 2004 vice-presidential nominee, has traveled to Iowa 16 times since the beginning of last year, building his organization there in hopes of scoring an early triumph that carries him into the next contests.  ''The earlier process will reward candidates who truly have a succinct, credible, authentic and passionate message which can sustain itself over the long nature of the campaign,'' said Matthew Dowd, the chief strategist for Mr. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004.  He also said that in 2007 candidates would be rewarded by scoring points in ''nonvoting events'' such as media attention, their standings in the polls and the size and response of crowds, because those sorts of factors will help winnow the field more than the primaries still a year away.  Despite the intense focus by most candidates on showing that they can raise the money to run a long and expensive campaign, having a big bank account, Mr. Dowd argued, may actually not be as important in the early stages of this presidential cycle as it was in previous ones.  ''It's for two reasons: the early process will not involve paid media as much, and new technology allows little cost to talk directly to voters,'' he said. ''And the early process will make it more important for a campaign to know how to respond to knowable and unknowable events in next 12 months.''  Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist who worked on the presidential campaigns of Representative Richard A. Gephardt in 2003 and Senator John Kerry in 2004, warned that candidates and their aides, no matter how tired they become, would have to stay on their toes because any misstep might be captured on tape and circulated on the Internet.  ''Every move they make in Iowa and New Hampshire will be on YouTube,'' Mr. Elmendorf said. ''The only certainty by January '08 is that people will be pretty tired.''  Besides taking a toll on the declared candidates, the length and cost of current campaigns also deters potential entrants. Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and former Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia were considered among the brightest Democratic prospects, but both declined to run. They cited the crowded field, the endless burden of fund-raising and the brutal personal cost of today's presidential campaigns.  ",

                    "text": "  Importing Contacts From Eudora  Q. Is there a way to transfer a large address book from Eudora to another e-mail program?  A. Relocating your Eudora e-mail address book is possible in most situations. The exact steps will vary based on the version of Eudora you have, the operating system you have and the new e-mail program you want to use.  In many cases, you can simply use an importing tool from your new e-mail software to pull in the address book from your Eudora program. Microsoft Outlook Express and Mozilla Thunderbird are two programs with such an option.  Some versions of Eudora use a full-feature address book that can hold more information than just a name and an e-mail address, offering fields for notes, photos and multiple mailing addresses as well. If your Eudora address book is fairly detailed, you may want to consider getting conversion software that can move all of this information more accurately between mail programs.  Address Magic by Connected Software (www.connectedsw.com/AddressMagic.php) is one such utility for Windows. The eMailman Web site, which devotes itself to all things e-mail, has a page of links to other address-book conversion programs for Mac and Windows systems at www.emailman.com/conversion.  Untangling A Mess of Cables  Q. What can I do about the tangle of computer cables on and behind the desk?  A. If you find your desk area has become knotted with snaking cables, there are a couple of approaches to untangling the problem.  One way to cut down on cables is to use wireless peripherals. For example, many mice, keyboards, speakers and other computer hardware items now come in Bluetooth versions that use radio signals to transmit data between devices instead of a cable. This option, however, can be expensive, and you may not be able to find wireless products for all of your hardware needs.  A cable-management system is a cheaper option. Companies like Cable-Safe (www.cable-safe.com) offer several products for tying down (or tying up) the power cords and wires coming out of the computer.  Office supply stores like Staples (www.staples.com) and Office Depot (www.officedepot.com) also sell a variety of inexpensive cable ties, clips and sleeves to keep cords neatly bound and under control. Threading your cables through plastic tubing (like the kind sold for aquariums) is another option, and is sometimes favored by those with pets who like to nibble on computer cables.  Adding Titles To Songs in iTunes  Q. Sometimes when I try to import music from a CD into iTunes, the computer lists the songs as ''Track 01, Track 02,'' etc. Is there any way I can manually add the information for each song?  A. The iTunes program pulls down album information over the Internet from the Gracenote CD Database (also known as the CDDB). If you are not online when you import the songs from the CD, iTunes cannot download the titles. You may also see the ''Track 01'' listing if you are connected to the Internet but there is no information about that particular album in the database.  If you imported the tracks when you were offline, you can go back and look for the song information the next time you fire up your Internet connection. Once you are online, go to iTunes and click on the nameless tracks you want to identify.  On the Windows version of the program, holding down the Shift key lets you select multiple tracks listed next to each other, and holding down the Control key while you click lets you select nonadjacent songs in a list. (On the Mac, the Shift and Command keys provide the same functions.)  Once you have selected your tracks, go to the Advanced menu and select ''Get CD Track Names.'' If iTunes can find the album, it should apply the song information to your selected tracks.  If all else fails, you can manually type in the information for each song. One way to do this is to select the song or album you want to change and choose Get Info from the File menu. Click the Info tab and make your changes. If you are editing a whole album's worth of tracks, click the next button to go to the next track and click the O.K. button when finished.  J. D. BIERSDORFER  Q & A  ",

                    "text": "  Chinese officials announced Wednesday that President Hu Jintao would visit Sudan in early February and would seek a diplomatic solution to the conflict in the country's western Darfur region, which the United States has described as genocide.  Mr. Hu's visit to Sudan will be part of an eight-country tour of Africa, the latest of a string of high-level visits to the continent by Chinese officials.  In recent months, China has faced widespread criticism for its economic engagement with Sudan at a time when government-allied militias known as the janjaweed have carried out frequent attacks on civilian populations in western Darfur. At least 200,000 people have died in the conflict since early 2003, and many thousands have been forced to flee their homes.  China has played a leading role in building a thriving oil industry in Sudan amid the violence in Darfur, and now imports more than 64 percent of Sudan's oil exports, accounting for nearly 5 percent of China's petroleum imports.  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that China would use its diplomatic influence to encourage a settlement of the Darfur crisis, but that China would not publicly pressure Sudan or threaten it with sanctions.  ''The Sudan issue should be resolved like any other -- through peaceful negotiation,'' Assistant Foreign Minister Zhai Jun said at a news conference in Beijing. ''Using pressure and imposing sanctions is not practical and will not help settle the issue.''  Mr. Zhai acknowledged China's prominent role as a leading trading partner of Sudan's and said China would sign new economic agreements with the country during Mr. Hu's visit. ''With Sudan, we have cooperation in many aspects, including military cooperation,'' he said. ''In this, we have nothing to hide.''  China's intense engagement with the continent has brought increasing scrutiny, and very often criticism, from Western governments and from international human rights groups and others who say China ignores questions of governance and of rights as it pursues business opportunities in Africa.  Despite the vow not to pressure the Sudanese government, Chinese diplomatic analysts said the announcement of a diplomatic initiative with Sudan was a turning point in China's foreign policy and in its relations with Africa in particular.  ''This is a remarkable change,'' said Shi Yinhong, an expert in international relations at People's University in Beijing. ''It would boost China's image in the West, and would be welcomed in Africa, too.''  Mr. Shi said that during the recent China-Africa summit meeting in Beijing, Mr. Hu had pushed the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, in private to cooperate with the United Nations.  ''China has begun to follow a different pattern on this issue,'' Mr. Shi said, adding, ''When the world talks about China's rise, naturally that places demands and pressure on China to take on more responsibility.''  An expert in African affairs, however, expressed more caution. ''China now is showing slightly different tactics, paying more attention,'' said He Wenping, director of African studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in Beijing. ''Hu's visit at least gives a clear signal that China thinks the Sudan issue is important and China wants to play a role. But China's strategy remains the same, and as always, it uses quiet diplomacy to keep a constructive engagement, rather than waving a stick.''  In the last two years, Africa has been the focus of a huge push by Chinese diplomats and companies to expand China's influence abroad. Africa's many countries offer China a rich source of support in United Nations votes and help in securing petroleum and other natural resources needed by China's booming economy.  Africa is also a stage of China's bitter diplomatic contest with Taiwan, with China offering large amounts of foreign aid and investment to countries in order to keep them from recognizing Taiwan, which this country regards as a breakaway province.  The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr. Zhai, acknowledged that there had been problems in certain countries, like Zambia, where there were riots last year at a Chinese-controlled copper mine after a labor dispute over working conditions. ''We are also trying to educate Chinese businesses who have interests in Africa and investments there to respect social conventions and observe local laws and regulations,'' he said.  ",

                    "text": "  Compared with a decade ago, America's children appear to be marginally better off, according to a Census Bureau analysis. More are performing at grade level in school, more are taking lessons after class and on weekends and more parents -- especially in black households -- are imposing limits on television viewing.  And, by a small margin, more children under 6 are eating breakfast with at least one parent.  On the other hand, better educated and wealthier parents were generally less likely than other parents to have dinner with their children, once the children turn 6.  The Census Bureau report, titled ''A Child's Day,'' surveyed parents to analyze benchmarks of well-being for 73 million children from a 2003 review of income and participation in various government assistance programs. It compared some of the findings with results from similar surveys in 1994 and 2000.  ''We hadn't noted anything where children were doing worse,'' said Tallese Johnson, an author of the report.  Many of the results were left to half-empty, half-full ambiguities, and some seemed, perhaps, sugar-coated. For example, 47 percent of parents said they never felt angry with their children. Only 5 percent said their children often behaved in ways that bothered them a lot.  About 7 in 10 children under 6 were praised by a parent three or more times a day, but that declined to half of children 6 to 11 and a little more than 1 in 3 among 12- to 17-year-olds.  Parents of 7 in 10 children under 6, about half of 6- to 11-year-olds and about 4 in 10 children 12 to 17 said they played with or talked to their children just for fun for at least five minutes several times a day.  Non-Hispanic white parents were more likely to spend that kind of time, except when it came to teenagers. And generally, teenagers were praised less often than younger children, regardless of their parents' race, ethnicity, educational attainment or occupation.  Ms. Johnson and her co-author, Jane Lawler Dye, found a few improvements in child well-being compared with a decade earlier. The number of children considered ''on track'' academically increased to 75 percent, from 69 percent in 1994.  Also, the number of parents imposing rules for television viewing increased. Rules making certain programs off-limits and regulating viewing time by time of day and total hours were imposed on 54 percent of 3- to 5-year-olds in 1994, compared with 67 percent in 2003. Comparable numbers among 6- to 11-year-olds increased to 68 percent from 60 percent, and to 44 percent from 40 percent among 12- to 17-year-olds.  ''It's good news that more parents are restricting TV viewing because we know that children who watch a lot of TV are more likely to be obese,'' said Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. ''We know that black children spend more hours watching television than other children. Parents who live in dangerous neighborhoods seem to use television viewing as a way to keep their children safe at home.''  Parents who imposed no viewing rules were also least likely to have read to their young children (although there appeared to be no correlation between television rules and grade-level performance).  Most children have dinner each night with at least one parent, but not breakfast. Fifty-seven percent of children under age 6 have breakfast every day with at least one parent (up from 51 percent in 1998), but that drops to fewer than one-third among 6- to 11-year-olds and fewer than one-fourth among children 12 to 17.  Nearly 4 in 10 children (and more than half of black children) have been in regular child care, a situation that is more common when parents, regardless of race, are better educated and wealthier.  But racial and ethnic disparities persist, according to the report.  Children in wealthier households were about twice as likely to be enrolled in school programs for gifted students than those living in poverty.  ''It does underscore the pervasiveness of disadvantage of certain groups in every-day life,'' said William O'Hare, a senior fellow with the Kids Count project at the Annie E. Casey Foundation.  Hispanic children were least likely to have been read to by their parents. More than 1 in 5, Hispanic children ages 1 to 2 were not regularly read to. But Hispanic children liked school most often, while non-Hispanic whites were most likely to never have liked school. Nearly 1 in 5 black 12- to 17-year-olds had repeated a grade, and almost the same proportion had been expelled or suspended from school at some point, compared with about 1 in 10 among all children.  But children of wealthier parents were more likely than most other children to have repeated a grade and just as likely to have been suspended.  All parents said they wanted or expected their children to attend college, and they all set higher goals for their children's schooling after college than they expected the children to meet.  Hispanic children under 18 in central cities were most likely to be kept home as much as possible because their neighborhoods were perceived as dangerous; the same was true for more than 1 in 3 black children and 1 in 4 non-Hispanic whites.  Those disparities extend to the suburbs, where 33 percent of Hispanic children, 25 percent of blacks and 15 percent of whites are generally kept at home. In rural areas, 34 percent of black children were most likely to be kept home as much as possible.  ",

                    "text": "  MANY signs point to a growing historical consciousness among the American people. I trust that this is so. It is useful to remember that history is to the nation as memory is to the individual. As persons deprived of memory become disoriented and lost, not knowing where they have been and where they are going, so a nation denied a conception of the past will be disabled in dealing with its present and its future. ''The longer you look back,'' said Winston Churchill, ''the farther you can look forward.''  But all historians are prisoners of their own experience. We bring to history the preconceptions of our personalities and of our age. We cannot seize on ultimate and absolute truths. So the historian is committed to a doomed enterprise -- the quest for an unattainable objectivity.  Conceptions of the past are far from stable. They are perennially revised by the urgencies of the present. When new urgencies arise in our own times and lives, the historian's spotlight shifts, probing at last into the darkness, throwing into sharp relief things that were always there but that earlier historians had carelessly excised from the collective memory. New voices ring out of the historical dark and demand to be heard.  One has only to note how in the last half-century the movements for women's rights and civil rights have reformulated and renewed American history. Thus the present incessantly reinvents the past. In this sense, all history, as Benedetto Croce said, is contemporary history. It is these permutations of consciousness that make history so endlessly fascinating an intellectual adventure. ''The one duty we owe to history,'' said Oscar Wilde, ''is to rewrite it.''  We are the world's dominant military power, and I believe a consciousness of history is a moral necessity for a nation possessed of overweening power. History verifies John F. Kennedy's proposition, stated in the first year of his thousand days: ''We must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient -- that we are only 6 percent of the world's population; that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind; that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity; and therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.''  History is the best antidote to delusions of omnipotence and omniscience. Self-knowledge is the indispensable prelude to self-control, for the nation as well as for the individual, and history should forever remind us of the limits of our passing perspectives. It should strengthen us to resist the pressure to convert momentary impulses into moral absolutes. It should lead us to acknowledge our profound and chastening frailty as human beings -- to a recognition of the fact, so often and so sadly displayed, that the future outwits all our certitudes and that the possibilities of the future are more various than the human intellect is designed to conceive.  Sometimes, when I am particularly depressed, I ascribe our behavior to stupidity -- the stupidity of our leadership, the stupidity of our culture. Three decades ago, we suffered defeat in an unwinnable war against tribalism, the most fanatic of political emotions, fighting against a country about which we knew nothing and in which we had no vital interests. Vietnam was hopeless enough, but to repeat the same arrogant folly 30 years later in Iraq is unforgivable. The Swedish statesman Axel Oxenstierna famously said, ''Behold, my son, with how little wisdom the world is governed.''  A nation informed by a vivid understanding of the ironies of history is, I believe, best equipped to manage the tragic temptations of military power. Let us not bully our way through life, but let a growing sensitivity to history temper and civilize our use of power. In the meantime, let a thousand historical flowers bloom. History is never a closed book or a final verdict. It is forever in the making. Let historians never forsake the quest for knowledge in the interests of an ideology, a religion, a race, a nation.  The great strength of history in a free society is its capacity for self-correction. This is the endless excitement of historical writing -- the search to reconstruct what went before, a quest illuminated by those ever-changing prisms that continually place old questions in a new light.  History is a doomed enterprise that we happily pursue because of the thrill of the hunt, because exploring the past is such fun, because of the intellectual challenges involved, because a nation needs to know its own history. Or so we historians insist. Because in the end, a nation's history must be both the guide and the domain not so much of its historians as its citizens.  Op-Ed Contributor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who has won Pulitzer Prizes for history and biography, is the author, most recently, of ''War and the American Presidency.''  ",

No other Fox premiere has ever garnered more total viewers; among adults 18 to 49, it tied the 1997 ''X-Files'' season debut. For the night, Fox outdrew CBS, NBC, ABC, and the CW combined by 78 percent in the 18-to-49 demographic. CBS was second over all, buoyed by ''NCIS'' at 8 (15.9 million). NBC ranked third as ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' led at 10 (14.1 million). On Friday, the Disney Channel posted its second-most-watched day on record as ''Jump In!'' with Corbin Bleu (''High School Musical'') and Keke Palmer (''Akeelah and the Bee''), drew 8.2 million viewers, the most for a Disney Channel original movie. Following it, 7.6 million viewers tuned in for the premiere of ''Cory in the House,'' the best start for a Disney series.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

Mr. Kopp, who spent more than two years as a fugitive in Mexico and France, is serving a sentence of 25 years to life after his conviction on state murder charges.

North Carolina guard Ivory Latta said the flight home was filled with quiet tears.  Weeks and months passed, and Latta refused to watch the film from that game.  But on Friday, as the undefeated Tar Heels prepared for Sunday's game against Maryland, North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell figured the time was right. Her players sat and stomached last season's end.  ''Man, it was depressing,'' Latta said. ''It was very hard to watch.''  But Latta said the film was also helpful. The players noticed simple mistakes they had made and vowed not to repeat them. At the Comcast Center on Sunday, the second-ranked Tar Heels took their long-awaited shot at the No. 3 Terrapins. This time, they walked off the court delighted, with an 84-71 victory that snapped Maryland's 19-game home winning streak before a crowd of 17,950 that was the largest to attend an Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season women's game.  ''Playing against North Carolina, playing against Duke, the revenge factor is so, so big right now,'' said Maryland forward Laura Harper, whose team lost to Duke, 81-62, on Jan. 13. ''They come ready to play us.''  For a time, North Carolina's victory looked as if it would come easily. The Tar Heels (23-0, 7-0) raced to a 20-point second-half lead behind the shooting of Latta, who made six 3-pointers and finished with 32 points.  But Maryland (21-2, 5-2) responded with a furious comeback that was led by the senior guard Shay Doron, who scored 13 of her 19 points in the second half. With 3 minutes 13 seconds left, Doron converted a 15-footer, pulling the Terrapins to 67-66.  ''She just kept putting them up, making shots and all,'' Hatchell said. ''But, you know, that's Maryland; I knew they could score like that.''  The Tar Heels, who entered the game as the nation's top-scoring team, can pounce quickly, too. They closed the game with a 17-5 run, and revenge was theirs.  When Maryland, Duke and North Carolina reached the Final Four last season, it was the first time a conference had placed three teams in the national semifinals; the A.C.C. had never sent more than one.  This season, the three A.C.C. powers have a combined record of 65-2, with the two losses coming within their impressive triumvirate. Maryland plays host to Duke on Feb. 18 but will not face North Carolina again in the regular season. North Carolina plays host to Duke on Feb. 8 before visiting the Blue Devils on Feb. 25.  Sunday's game became a sellout more than two weeks ago. The atmosphere and the national-television audience might have caused some early-game jitters for the Terrapins. Maryland missed 15 of its first 18 field-goal attempts and committed 10 turnovers in the first 10 minutes.  ''Anxiousness, nerves, whatever you want to call it,'' Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. ''But at the same time, we have played on the biggest stage before.''  With 30 seconds remaining in the first half and North Carolina leading, 33-27, Maryland guard Kristi Toliver was hounded by two defenders as she struggled to bring the ball across midcourt. Frese stomped the floor and yelled to a referee, frustrated that a foul had not been called. She received a technical foul, and Latta made both free throws, giving the Tar Heels an 8-point halftime lead. Latta made four 3-pointers in the first 4:50 of the second half, putting North Carolina ahead by 20.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Seton Hall announced a heaping portion of bad news before Friday night's game against Georgetown. Its starting center and tallest player, the 6-foot-10 Grant Billmeier, was lost for the season.  The Pirates never seemed to rebound -- literally and figuratively.  Georgetown raced to an early lead and it dominated the boards in a 74-58 victory at Continental Arena.  ''I've been a head coach eight years, and I've never seen a stat where we got beat on the boards, 39 to 11,'' Seton Hall Coach Bobby Gonzalez said. ''We had one defensive rebound at halftime.''  It got worse in the second half, when the Pirates (11-7, 3-3 Big East) managed only four rebounds.  Georgetown (13-5, 3-2) had a significant height advantage. It started three players who were 6-8 or taller, including the 7-2 center Roy Hibbert. Seton Hall's tallest starter was Stan Gaines, who was listed at 6-7.  Billmeier, a tri-captain, tore his left anterior cruciate ligament while playing defense during the opening minutes of Wednesday's 69-68 victory against Providence. He started 14 times this season and averaged 3.4 points and 3.4 rebounds a game.  ''He gives you 15, 20 minutes a night,'' Gonzalez said of Billmeier. ''He changes the rotation, he is a senior, he does play hard. He's a great energy guy. And so now you have one less body. It's a small team getting smaller.''  John Garcia, at 6-9, became Seton Hall's tallest player. He came off the bench to grab three rebounds, which tied Paul Gause for the team high. Georgetown, which had been ranked eighth in the preseason but has fizzled out of the Top 25, had six players with at least three rebounds. DaJuan Summers had a game-high 10 rebounds and 17 points.  ''If I'm going to give this team anything, it's rebounds,'' Garcia said. ''I'm not going to make excuses.''  Gonzalez hinted at an excuse anyway, saying that Seton Hall was fatigued from playing four games in nine days. And when the Hoyas raced to a 10-0 lead after just 2 minutes 10 seconds, the Pirates were not able to recover. They trailed, 34-21, at halftime and fell behind by as many as 20 points late in the game.  Jonathan Wallace led Georgetown with a career-high 21 points, and he helped break down Seton Hall's full-court pressure and zone defense.  ''We handled their pressure better than I anticipated,'' Georgetown Coach John Thompson III said. ''Our guys were very poised and pretty attentive and seeing when their teammates were in trouble.''  Brian Laing scored a team-high 19 points for the Pirates. But like five of his teammates, he had no rebounds.  ''We just didn't have the bodies and the energy and the juice to play a team like Georgetown tonight,'' Gonzalez said. ''It's just that simple.''  LOYOLA, MD. 62, ST. PETER'S 55 -- Michael Tuck made four free throws in the final 11 seconds and finished with 14 points as Loyola of Maryland beat host Saint Peter's.  Gerald Brown and Marquis Sullivan also scored 14 points each for the Greyhounds (10-7, 6-1 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference), and Brett Harvey had a game-high eight assists.  Akeem Gooding had 16 points and 6 rebounds -- both game highs -- to lead the Peacocks (3-15, 1-7), who made just 37 percent of their shots. Kevin Spann added 12 points, and Todd Sowell finished with 11 and Raul Orta had 10.  Loyola led for most of the game but had trouble putting away the Peacocks, who rallied late and tied the score at 55-55 when Brandon Brock hit a jumper with 56 seconds left.  But the Greyhounds closed the game with a 7-0 run keyed by Tuck's free throws. (AP)  FAIRFIELD 72, SIENA 67 -- Michael Van Schaick scored 27 points to lead Fairfield in a victory against host Siena.  Fairfield (5-15, 3-5 MAAC) rallied from a 9-point deficit with 5:32 remaining for the victory.  Van Schaick tied the score at 66-66 with his fifth 3-pointer of the game with a minute left.  After Kenny Hasbrouck missed a jumper for Siena, Van Schaick was fouled with 30 seconds left and converted both free throws.  Siena (9-8, 5-3) had a chance to tie, but David Ryan missed the first of two free throws with 22 seconds left.  After Jonathan Han made two free throws to put Fairfield up, 70-67, with 16 seconds to go, the Saints failed to get a shot off.  Hasbrouck led the Saints with 23 points, and Michael Haddix had 14 points and 14 rebounds.  Siena shot 46 percent from the field and 38 percent from 3-point range. The Saints limited the Stags to just 39 percent from the floor and 36 percent from long range. (AP)  WOMEN  MARYLAND 95, VIRGINIA 68 -- Crystal Langhorne had 17 points and 12 rebounds, Laura Harper had 21, and No. 3 Maryland bounced back from its first loss of the season by cruising past visiting Virginia.  Kristi Toliver scored 20 points and Marissa Coleman added 16 for the Terrapins (19-1, 3-1 Atlantic Coast Conference), the defending national champions, who were coming off an 82-61 defeat at Duke on Saturday that dropped them from the top spot in the Associated Press poll.  Lyndra Littles led Virginia (12-6, 2-2) with a career-high-tying 23points. The Cavaliers have lost fourin a row at Maryland. (AP)  COLLEGES  ",

                    "text": "  I was all set not to like Peter Singer's article (Dec. 17). I think that the freedom to choose what one does with one's own money is a fundamental building block of a free society. That said, I found myself agreeing with nearly all of what he wrote. As a Christian, I strongly believe that the more fortunate should give generously to those in need. Also, I agree that one's capacity to give greatly increases after one's basic needs are met, so the calculation methods and their underlying assumptions rang true to me, too.  It seems to me that the only real way to permanently eradicate poverty is to attack the conditions that create it -- overpopulation, the lack of the means to produce food, clothing and shelter locally, the lack of other viable jobs and industries, etc. Perhaps these are the sorts of things the United Nations Millennium Summit has in mind as ways to meet the goals listed in the article.  I think most people's inclination to give is increased by knowing that their gifts will be carefully channeled into projects that deliver long-term benefits. Equally important is knowing there are safeguards, audits and independent watchers in place to make sure the charitable organizations themselves are handling the monies efficiently and ethically.  Russ Maney  Louisville, Ky.  Private philanthropy allows for the kind of risk-taking that governments won't and, frankly, can't do. That's good. But private philanthropy cannot sustain the scale of global interventions needed over the long term the way governments can. Philanthropists may get bored and want to move on to other issues. Or they may not want to get involved in the difficult and complex politics often needed, perhaps for fear of offending the richest markets for their business-related products.  Patti Culross  Crockett, Calif.  Why does Singer suggest that wealth should be given away as earned each year? Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are able to give away many billions of dollars only because they continued, over a period of many years, to reinvest in building their companies, as opposed to spending or giving away their wealth. Are they even now giving it away too soon? Assuming a 15 percent annual rate of return, if they waited five more years, they could give away twice as much as today.  William Roth  Avon, Conn.  ",

                    "text": "  Getting Graphic With Vista  Q. When shopping for a new computer, what kind of graphics card will be necessary to run Microsoft's Windows Vista?  A. The Windows Vista operating system, due at the end of the month for consumers, will be available in several versions with a range of system requirements, so your graphics-card needs will vary. Most hardware makers are labeling new computers as either Vista Capable to run the basic version, or Vista Premium Ready for a PC that can handle more Vista features.  To run the low-end Vista Home Basic version of the system, Microsoft states that a compatible PC needs to have at least an 800-megahertz processor, 512 megabytes of system memory and a graphics processor that can run the DirectX 9 multimedia software and has at least 32 megabytes of graphics memory.  While these hardware requirements are designed for the simplest version of Vista, they are not enough to display Windows Aero, its sophisticated graphical interface. Windows Aero -- which works with the Vista Home Premium, Vista Business, Vista Enterprise and Vista Ultimate editions of the system -- features shimmering effects like translucent windows and 3-D graphics.  According to Microsoft, a Windows Aero-compatible graphics card must be able to handle DirectX 9, Pixel Shader 2.0 technology and support 32 bits per pixel for color depth. The card needs at least 128 megabytes of graphics memory (although 256 megabytes of dedicated graphics memory is often recommended) and be able to run the Windows Display Driver Model software. Also known as W.D.D.M., that is the code that lets Vista and the graphics card communicate properly.  The Windows Vista home page of Microsoft's site has the full system requirements at www.microsoft.com/windowsvista.  Many PC makers now have areas of their Web sites devoted to Vista systems and information (www.dell.com/vista, for example) and may be helpful for research. For those looking to upgrade existing computers, graphics-card manufacturers like Nvidia (www.nvidia.com) and ATI (ati.amd.com) detail their product specifications on their Web sites and tell which cards work best with Microsoft's new system.  Voice Quality On the Internet  Q. Is there a way to make VoIP phone calls sound smoother, with fewer gaps in the audio?  A. Voice-over-Internet protocol, or VoIP, is technology that converts a phone conversation into data that can travel over a computer network -- and uses the Internet's cables instead of the telephone company's wires to carry the chat.  VoIP can be used for free computer-to-computer audio calls with software like Skype (www.skype.com). Many companies also offer residential and business VoIP phone plans that work pretty much like standard telephone service except for the use of Internet networking to carry the calls.  One factor that can affect call quality is network traffic. If your home or office network is being used to upload, download or stream a lot of data while you are trying to talk over your VoIP connection, the audio quality of the call may suffer from the lack of available bandwidth. Most VoIP services require a broadband Internet connection.  Call fidelity may vary by VoIP provider, and several consumer-oriented product sites and magazines have compared the different services for value and call quality. Consumer Reports has tested VoIP service, and sites like ConsumerSearch (www.consumersearch.com) have also done VoIP roundups.  New Background For a Mac Desktop  Q. How do I make my Mac automatically change its desktop background?  A. In recent versions of Mac OS X, you can set the computer to change its desktop background image at specified intervals in the System Preferences area. To get there, go to the Apple menu to System Preferences. Click on the Desktop & Screen Saver icon and click the Desktop tab.  In the dialog box, you can select a folder of photos or iPhoto album to use as background images. Put a check in the box next to ''Change picture'' and use the drop-down menu to select the length of time to display each image.  J. D. BIERSDORFER  Q & A  ",

                    "text": "  Stephanie Robinson Davis and Randy Davis are young parents just starting out. There can be a lot to learn, but in the Davises' house, they already know that their children come first.  ''I try my best to give them everything I didn't have,'' said Mr. Davis, 27. ''I want them to have a stable home. I never really had a stable home because I was in and out of foster care.''  Nyliyah, 2, danced around the coffee table. ''Me comfortable,'' she said in a singsong voice.  Ms. Davis, 26, laughed at her daughter's energy, saying, ''It's got to be the Froot Loops.''  The couple's other child, Shymell, 4, named for his quiet nature, even as a baby, watched the action from one corner of the immaculate living room, which Ms. Davis had carefully decorated and scrubbed to a shine.  As children, Mr. and Ms. Davis both spent years in foster care. Their cheerful home is proof of the new path they are making for their own children. The road has not always been easy.  Mr. Davis was born in 1980. He said drugs were booming then, and ''my mother, she was really on it hard.'' He was raised mostly by his grandmother, who died when he was 11. He was then placed in a foster home in the Bronx.  Meanwhile, Ms. Davis landed in foster care herself as her mother battled her own addictions and abusive relationships. Still, throughout the nearly 12 years that she was in foster care, her mother fought to stay in her life. ''My mother always made sure that we was close, always,'' Ms. Davis said.  She is the oldest of eight children and fiercely protective of her siblings. ''I know what it's like to be a mother. It's easy to take care of my children because I know what it's like to be a mother since a very young age,'' she said.  Throughout their tumultuous childhoods, both of the Davises found an adult they could count on: Jean Marie De Veaux, education coordinator at the Family Foster Care program of the Children's Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.  ''I've been knowing her since I was a itty-bitty little person,'' Ms. Davis said. Ms. De Veaux provided information about schools, scholarships, jobs and bill-paying. Anything the Davises needed to know, they went to Ms. De Veaux.  Mr. Davis said: ''If I needed help, she was there for me. I love Miss Jean Marie De Veaux.''  The couple met as young adults at a day care center where they were both working in jobs they got through the Children's Aid Society. Ms. Davis had been hired full time after completing an internship, and Mr. Davis was working there during breaks from college at Norfolk State University in Virginia.  In May 2002, Mr. Davis left school about a semester short of graduation. Ms. Davis was pregnant with Shymell, and Mr. Davis would not think of her going through pregnancy alone, nor of his child's life beginning without him. Mr. Davis hopes to complete his degree and says he misses college. ''I wanted to be a social worker; that's what I majored in,'' he said.  Mr. Davis ended up working in construction, even though the income was quite unstable and he found the work unsatisfying. Ms. Davis was a seasonal Parks Department employee.  Their lives became even more of a struggle one day in March when Ms. Davis's mother died suddenly from a heart problem. Ms. Davis took on more family responsibility. Her savings went to cover funeral costs and to help provide for her younger siblings.  Her 3-year-old brother, Malikk, is of the greatest concern. She is helping her oldest brother care for him now. ''We all have to decide what we're going to do right now to keep this family together,'' Ms. Davis said. Her brother Alfred Robinson, 19, also sometimes lives with the Davises.  ''I wouldn't trade it in for a minute, because they all give me some type of support,'' she said.  Ms. Davis's job came to an end for the season in March, coincidentally on the day her mother died. The aftermath has derailed her search for a new job.  The Davises receive $345 in food stamps each month and $119.50 in public assistance. The $184 rent on their two-bedroom apartment in Harlem is covered by public assistance.  By the fall, construction work for Mr. Davis had slowed and the family was struggling to keep up. They turned to Ms. De Veaux for help. She used $605.59 in Neediest Cases money: $300 for clothing vouchers for the children, $152 for two monthly MetroCards for continuing job searches and $153.59 toward part of a phone bill.  The Children's Aid Society also helped with employment. On Nov. 14, Mr. Davis started working part time at the organization's P.S. 8 Community Schools program. ''I love it. I love working with kids,'' he said. He hopes to do more. ''If they put me full time, I'd jump and touch the sky.''  With a little help from Neediest Cases, and continuing help from Ms. De Veaux, the Davises are making it.  Ms. De Veaux said, ''When they had each of their babies, I watched them trying to recreate the love and stability that they missed out on, in part. This is such a success story, I think, from foster care because they've been through a lot.  ''This is what marriage is. This is what commitment is. It's not what you see in the movies.''

                    "text": "  Diane Sawyer, whose continued commitment to ''Good Morning America'' has been the subject of speculation since Charles Gibson departed the show in June, has in recent weeks left some executives at ABC with the impression that she intends to remain with the program until at least early summer, according to one executive briefed directly on Ms. Sawyer's status.  By sending signals that she intends to stay with ''Good Morning America'' -- at least through the end of the current prime-time television season, and perhaps longer still -- Ms. Sawyer has prompted some exhaling in the upper echelons of both the news division and the network as a whole. That is because she remains ABC's biggest news star in the morning -- and perhaps the evening as well -- on a program that is by far the news division's most valuable, with annual profits believed to be well in excess of $100 million.  The executive, who spoke yesterday on condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomacy involved, said Ms. Sawyer had met before Christmas, as she does periodically, with David Westin, the president of ABC News. Separately, the official said, she had also had a holiday lunch in New York with Robert A. Iger, the president and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, ABC's corporate parent, though that get-together was characterized as more social than business.  By staying put, Ms. Sawyer, 61, also promises to keep ''Good Morning America'' competitive with ''Today'' on NBC, the ratings leader for more than a decade, at a moment when that program and its audience are continuing to adjust to a new co-anchor, Meredith Vieira, who replaced Katie Couric in September. (Since Mr. Gibson's departure for ''World News,'' ''Good Morning America'' has gone through some growing pains of its own, as it introduced Chris Cuomo as its news reader and Sam Champion as its weatherman, while pairing Robin Roberts with Ms. Sawyer as lead anchors.)  In the most recent November sweeps period, ''Today'' had an average daily audience of 5.8 million, about 735,000 more than ''Good Morning America,'' which drew an audience of about 5.1 million, according to Nielsen Media Research. During the same period a year ago, the lead of ''Today'' over ''Good Morning America'' was about 5,000 viewers larger, although both shows have lost viewers over the last year.  In June an ABC spokesman said Ms. Sawyer remained committed to ''Good Morning America'' through at least early 2007. When asked in September how much longer she planned to stay with the program, she told a reporter that she was not ready to entertain that question.  '''I'm sorry if it sounds like a dodge,'' she said at the time. ''I truly am looking ahead and enjoying this part. And there is plenty of time to think about what remains after -- when and whether.''  Since then Ms. Sawyer has appeared to throw herself into the program anew, traveling to North Korea -- for both ''Good Morning America'' and a prime-time special for ABC -- and later Israel (for less than 24 hours), as well as landing the first interview with Mel Gibson after his drunken-driving arrest (which the network also played big in the morning and evening) and, yesterday, reporting at length from South Africa on the opening of a private school for girls by Oprah Winfrey.  When asked yesterday about Ms. Sawyer, Jeffrey Schneider, a senior vice president of ABC News, dismissed any notion of a timetable for her tenure on the program.  He added: ''Diane is having a great time on 'G.M.A.' She loves the new team. And she has had an unrivaled run of groundbreaking reporting which has her passionately engaged.''  Ms. Sawyer's current contract with the network extends for at least two more years, said the executive with knowledge of her situation. But Ms. Sawyer has always characterized her tenure on ''Good Morning America'' as temporary -- and the network has regarded it as such -- even if it has been eight years since she joined the show, at a moment of crisis, after the network had just jettisoned a new, low-rated anchor team.

                    "text": "  Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, is using the Consumer Electronics Show here to highlight several new consumer-oriented products and to unveil a partnership with the Ford Motor Company to build Microsoft technology into several Ford models.  The show, the largest trade event in North America, has become an annual forum for Mr. Gates to mix product announcements with computer-filled visions of future Microsoft-based technologies.  In remarks prepared for delivery on Sunday night, the eve of the show, he sought to differentiate Microsoft from other companies by showing how its software products tie together a range of consumer activities including games, interactive television, communications and music. A Microsoft executive briefed reporters on the presentation on Friday.  Among the announcements was the introduction of a hardware upgrade to the Xbox 360 video-game system that will permit the system to deliver the Microsoft interactive television service being offered by partners, including AT&T. The system will duplicate many capabilities of the Media Center version of the Windows operating system, like the ability to record and play back digital video.  Microsoft and Ford are to offer a system called Sync, a voice-activated method for connecting cellphones and media players -- like Microsoft's Zune -- to a vehicle. Similar systems are widely available in Japanese and German automobiles. Sync, the first major commercial introduction of the Microsoft Auto software, offers hands-free phone dialing and can read incoming text messages through the car's audio system.  Microsoft is also introducing a consumer software product called Windows Home Server that will be marketed with several partners, including Hewlett-Packard. It will be an appliancelike device that will connect to a home network and perform functions like network-based backup and media and file-sharing as well as functioning as a Web server. The price will be between $400 and $500, according to Microsoft executives. The product will be based on Windows Server 2003, and not the company's newer Windows Vista operating system.  On the program with Mr. Gates was Robbie Bach, the executive in charge of the company's consumer products, to demonstrate game play involving a PC user running Windows Vista competing against a home user playing the game on an Xbox 360. There is no public timetable for such a capability, a company executive said, adding that the feature would not be available for all of the Xbox 360 games.  Another scheduled demonstration involved the current version of the Home of the Future, an installation at Microsoft headquarters with prototypes of home-oriented technologies. Applications chosen for the spotlight were radio-frequency ID tags and displays for the walls of children's bedrooms using organic light-emitting diodes.  ",

                    "text": "  For the third time in less than three months, Wal-Mart Stores has made major decisions affecting the advertising agencies that handle its giant marketing assignments.  Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, chose two agencies yesterday -- the Martin Agency and MediaVest -- to handle important assignments for ads that the company aims at mainstream consumers and that appear in major media like television, magazines and the Internet. Wal-Mart spends an estimated $580 million a year on such ads.  The announcement came five weeks after Wal-Mart stunned Madison Avenue by overturning decisions made by senior marketing executives on Oct. 25 to hire the Draft FCB Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, as the lead agency to create ads, and Carat USA, part of the Aegis Group, to handle what is called media planning and buying -- that is, determining where ads run and how much to pay for them.  Wal-Mart attributed the reconsideration to what were described as improprieties in the selection process involving Draft FCB and two Wal-Mart marketing executives, Julie Roehm and Sean Womack, who were subsequently fired. Ms. Roehm and Mr. Womack have denied any wrongdoing.  Wal-Mart barred Draft FCB from taking part in the new selection during the holiday shopping season, but invited Carat USA to try again, which it did, only to fall short the second time.  Wal-Mart let another agency owned by Interpublic, the Martin Agency, participate in the second round as it had in the first. That paid off for Interpublic as Martin was chosen to replace Draft FCB as the creative agency.  Martin is best known for its popular gecko ads for Geico insurance and campaigns for United Parcel Service that celebrate the color brown.  ''We are very pleased with Wal-Mart's decision,'' Interpublic said in a statement.  Shares of Interpublic fell sharply on Dec. 7, when the creative assignment was taken from Draft FCB. They climbed 33 cents, or 2.5 percent, to close at $13.37 yesterday.  In the second review, Martin bested one other agency for the creative assignment, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group. Ogilvy had also taken part in the first review and accepted Wal-Mart's invitation to participate again.  Carat USA lost this time as MediaVest, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe, was chosen to handle the media assignments.  Carat USA and MediaVest vied in the second review against Mediaedge:cia, also owned by WPP. Other large advertisers that use MediaVest include Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble -- two of Wal-Mart's biggest suppliers.  Martin and MediaVest were chosen for their ''deep retail experience, recognized creativity and an understanding of our customers,'' John Fleming, chief marketing officer at Wal-Mart, said in a statement.  Wal-Mart originally began scrutinizing its advertising agencies in May after working for decades with two, Bernstein-Rein and GSD&M. The review was part of a comprehensive reassessment by Wal-Mart of how it speaks to consumers, spurred by a slowdown in sales growth and increased competition from rivals like Kohl's and Target.  Wal-Mart has been struggling to find the right balance in its ads between playing up low prices on items like pantry staples and basic clothing or promoting pricier products like flat-screen TV sets and designer clothing.  Bernstein-Rein, a Wal-Mart agency since 1974, was notified in August that it would not be rehired. GSD&M, part of the Omnicom Group, a Wal-Mart agency since 1987, was notified Oct. 25 that it had lost its assignments.  After Wal-Mart declared the do-over last month, it invited GSD&M to take part, but executives at the agency declined.  Also yesterday, Wal-Mart named three agencies to handle assignments aimed at multicultural consumers. Those assignments were being reviewed separately from the creative and media assignments for the general market.  Global Hue was named to create ads aimed at black shoppers. The IW Group was chosen for ads for Asian-American consumers. And L\u00f3pez Negrete Communications was selected for ads aimed at Spanish-speaking shoppers.  ",

                    "text": "  Flying over snow-capped peaks and into a thick fog, the helicopter set down on a barren strip of rocks between two glaciers. A dozen bags of supplies, a rifle and a can of cooking gas were tossed out onto the cold ground. Then, with engines whining, the helicopter lifted off, snow and fog swirling in the rotor wash.  When it had disappeared over the horizon, no sound remained but the howling of the Arctic wind.  ''It feels a little like the days of the old explorers, doesn't it?'' Dennis Schmitt said.  Mr. Schmitt, a 60-year-old explorer from Berkeley, Calif., had just landed on a newly revealed island 400 miles north of the Arctic Circle in eastern Greenland. It was a moment of triumph: he had discovered the island on an ocean voyage in September 2005. Now, a year later, he and a small expedition team had returned to spend a week climbing peaks, crossing treacherous glaciers and documenting animal and plant life.  Despite its remote location, the island would almost certainly have been discovered, named and mapped almost a century ago when explorers like Jean-Baptiste Charcot and Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, charted these coastlines. Would have been discovered had it not been bound to the coast by glacial ice.  Maps of the region show a mountainous peninsula covered with glaciers. The island's distinct shape -- like a hand with three bony fingers pointing north -- looks like the end of the peninsula.  Now, where the maps showed only ice, a band of fast-flowing seawater ran between a newly exposed shoreline and the aquamarine-blue walls of a retreating ice shelf. The water was littered with dozens of icebergs, some as large as half an acre; every hour or so, several more tons of ice fractured off the shelf with a thunderous crack and an earth-shaking rumble.  All over Greenland and the Arctic, rising temperatures are not simply melting ice; they are changing the very geography of coastlines. Nunataks -- ''lonely mountains'' in Inuit -- that were encased in the margins of Greenland's ice sheet are being freed of their age-old bonds, exposing a new chain of islands, and a new opportunity for Arctic explorers to write their names on the landscape.  ''We are already in a new era of geography,'' said the Arctic explorer Will Steger. ''This phenomenon -- of an island all of a sudden appearing out of nowhere and the ice melting around it -- is a real common phenomenon now.''  In August, Mr. Steger discovered his own new island off the coast of the Norwegian island of Svalbard, high in the polar basin. Glaciers that had surrounded it when his ship passed through only two years earlier were gone this year, leaving only a small island alone in the open ocean.  ''We saw it ourselves up there, just how fast the ice is going,'' he said.  With 27,555 miles of coastline and thousands of fjords, inlets, bays and straits, Greenland has always been hard to map. Now its geography is becoming obsolete almost as soon as new maps are created.  Hans Jepsen is a cartographer at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which produces topographical maps for mining and oil companies. (Greenland is a largely self-governing region of Denmark.) Last summer, he spotted several new islands in an area where a massive ice shelf had broken up. Mr. Jepsen was unaware of Mr. Schmitt's discovery, and an old aerial photograph in his files showed the peninsula intact.  ''Clearly, the new island was detached from the mainland when the connecting glacier-bridge retreated southward,'' Mr. Jepsen said, adding that future maps would take note of the change.  The sudden appearance of the islands is a symptom of an ice sheet going into retreat, scientists say. Greenland is covered by 630,000 cubic miles of ice, enough water to raise global sea levels by 23 feet.  Carl Egede Boggild, a professor of snow-and-ice physics at the University Center of Svalbard, said Greenland could be losing more than 80 cubic miles of ice per year.  ''That corresponds to three times the volume of all the glaciers in the Alps,'' Dr. Boggild said. ''If you lose that much volume you'd definitely see new islands appear.''  He discovered an island himself a year ago while flying over northwestern Greenland. ''Suddenly I saw an island with glacial ice on it,'' he said. ''I looked at the map and it should have been a nunatak, but the present ice margin was about 10 kilometers away. So I can say that within the last five years the ice margin had retreated at least 10 kilometers.''  The abrupt acceleration of melting in Greenland has taken climate scientists by surprise. Tidewater glaciers, which discharge ice into the oceans as they break up in the process called calving, have doubled and tripled in speed all over Greenland. Ice shelves are breaking up, and summertime ''glacial earthquakes'' have been detected within the ice sheet.  ''The general thinking until very recently was that ice sheets don't react very quickly to climate,'' said Martin Truffer, a glaciologist at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. ''But that thinking is changing right now, because we're seeing things that people have thought are impossible.''  A study in The Journal of Climate last June observed that Greenland had become the single largest contributor to global sea-level rise.  Until recently, the consensus of climate scientists was that the impact of melting polar ice sheets would be negligible over the next 100 years. Ice sheets were thought to be extremely slow in reacting to atmospheric warming. The 2001 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, widely considered to be an authoritative scientific statement on the potential impacts of global warming, based its conclusions about sea-level rise on a computer model that predicted a slow onset of melting in Greenland.  ''When you look at the ice sheet, the models didn't work, which puts us on shaky ground,'' said Richard Alley, a geosciences professor at Pennsylvania State University.  There is no consensus on how much Greenland's ice will melt in the near future, Dr. Alley said, and no computer model that can accurately predict the future of the ice sheet. Yet given the acceleration of tidewater-glacier melting, a sea-level rise of a foot or two in the coming decades is entirely possible, he said. That bodes ill for island nations and those who live near the coast.  ''Even a foot rise is a pretty horrible scenario,'' said Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University in Miami.  On low-lying and gently sloping land like coastal river deltas, a sea-level rise of just one foot would send water thousands of feet inland. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide make their homes in such deltas; virtually all of coastal Bangladesh lies in the delta of the Ganges River. Over the long term, much larger sea-level rises would render the world's coastlines unrecognizable, creating a whole new series of islands.  ''Here in Miami,'' Dr. Leatherman said, ''we're going to have an ocean on both sides of us.''  Such ominous implications are not lost on Mr. Schmitt, who says he hopes that the island he discovered in Greenland in September will become an international symbol of the effects of climate change. Mr. Schmitt, who speaks Inuit, has provisionally named it Uunartoq Qeqertoq: the warming island.  Global warming has profoundly altered the nature of polar exploration, said Mr. Schmitt, who in 40 years has logged more than 100 Arctic expeditions. Routes once pioneered on a dogsled are routinely paddled in a kayak now; many features, like the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf in Greenland's northwest, have disappeared for good.  ''There is a dark side to this,'' he said about the new island. ''We felt the exhilaration of discovery. We were exploring something new. But of course, there was also something scary about what we did there. We were looking in the face of these changes, and all of us were thinking of the dire consequences.''  Correction:  January 18, 2007, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times on Tuesday about the appearance of a new island as a result of glacial melting in Greenland referred incorrectly to a region where another such island has appeared. Svalbard, off Norway, is an archipelago, not an island.  ",

                    "text": "  OF all the dishes I ate for the first time in 2006, this one stands out. It's amazing how good it is, how simple it is, how easy and fast it is. It's also amazing how puzzled you must be hearing me say these things about scrambled eggs with shrimp. Have faith.  It's a Chinese restaurant dish, one that I encountered in many forms on a recent trip to Los Angeles, including the hard-to-handle but perhaps even more delicious scrambled eggs with Dungeness crab, in which the crab remained in its shell. That was something of a mess, as were scrambled eggs with lobster and scrambled eggs with head-on-shrimp. The version here, in which the shrimp are peeled, is in fact quite tidy.  What all of these preparations have in common is the wonderful way in which the flavors of the shellfish leach into the eggs. This does not become a bunch of shrimp sitting in a bunch of eggs; it becomes shrimp-flavored eggs. This transfer of flavor explains why it makes some sense to leave the shells on the shrimp, or crab, or lobster; but not enough sense to bother doing it that way.  Scrambling eggs the right way is not difficult, but it's a technique that isn't known by everyone. You want to start the eggs in a not-too-hot pan, then turn the heat up high. Stir them almost constantly and, when curds begin to form, stir them more. If the eggs begin to stick, or the curds become large, take the pan off the heat immediately and stir. When the cooking slows down again, put them back on the heat.  If you want this dish at its best, stop cooking when the eggs are creamy and even a little bit of liquid remains. (If you like your eggs dry, cook them as you usually do.)  Eat this immediately, really hot. I made a batch as an appetizer for a party, using 24 eggs and about two pounds of shrimp. It was gone in a minute, and my feeling is that it was the high point of the meal.  Scrambled Eggs with Shrimp  Time: 20 minutes  3/4 pound raw shrimp, peeled  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  3 tablespoons peanut oil, butter or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn  8 eggs  2 tablespoons soy sauce  1 tablespoon sesame oil  1/2 cup chopped scallions  Chopped fresh cilantro leaves for garnish, optional.  1. Devein shrimp if you like; if large, cut into bite-size pieces. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  2. Put oil or butter in a large skillet, preferably nonstick or cast iron, and turn heat to medium. When hot, add shrimp. Cook, stirring, until shrimp is somewhat pink. Beat eggs in a bowl with soy sauce and sesame oil.  3. Turn heat to medium high and add eggs and scallions. Cook, scraping pan with a rubber spatula. Fold eggs over themselves, breaking up curds. If mixture clumps, remove it from heat and stir, then return to heat.  4. When eggs are creamy, adjust seasoning, garnish if you like and serve immediately.  Yield: 4 servings.  THE MINIMALIST  ",

                    "text": "  On a recent cold Saturday, when most children around the city were relaxing after a week at school, 320 boys and girls, ages 10 to 13, filed into Nightingale-Bamford, a private girls' school in a stately brick building on the Upper East Side.  The children, most black or Hispanic, were going to be interviewed for a shot at admission to a private day or boarding school, or an elite suburban public school, through A Better Chance, a nonprofit group. The boys wore jackets and neckties. The girls were in prim skirts or nicely pressed trousers. Some were confident, but many were nervous, folding and unfolding their hands, sitting up extra straight as they waited to be interviewed. The stakes, after all, were high.  The program's mission is to increase the number of minority men and women in leadership positions. It is really about social mobility, whisking children out of their environment in urban neighborhoods and transporting them to institutions that are incubators for presidents, senators and titans of industry -- like Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., President Bush's alma mater.  ''These schools are pathways to influence and power in our society,'' said Sandra Simmons, the president of the group, pointing out that Governor-elect Deval L. Patrick of Massachusetts, the state's first black governor, is an alumnus of the program.  Yet A Better Chance and similar programs, like the New York City-based Prep for Prep, can only hope to provide mobility for the few. Most of the children who seek placement will never get a spot. In 2006, for example, 2,153 students nationwide applied to A Better Chance; about half passed the screening process, but only 624 children were accepted and 455 enrolled. The others declined their spots, largely for financial reasons, group officials said.  The former president of the group, Judith Berry Griffin, worried so much about talented students who had been rejected that she left the organization in 2003 and established a new nonprofit group, Pathways to College, to help them.  THE fact, she said, is that most public middle schools serving urban youth simply are not preparing children for academically challenging high schools, public or private. Even if they were, there are not many seats available in the elite private schools, or enough scholarship money to support the students who need financial aid, she said.  ''There are just not enough places,'' she said in a telephone interview from her office in Englewood, N.J. ''It's like musical chairs. We simply have to come to grips with the fact that we are throwing away hundreds of thousands of talented children. We don't even know what talent we are throwing away.''  Rather than helping a few students get coveted spots in a few schools, she now tries to help children in low-performing public high schools, like Barringer in Newark, get the skills they need to attend college by offering after-school writing courses and college guidance. ''My real goal is to bring about systemic change in the public schools,'' she said.  Ms. Simmons acknowledged the limitations of her program in being able to help only a small number of children. But, she said, it still has great impact because it vaults talented students of color to the highest echelons of society.  At the Nightingale-Bamford school, Kirk Cohall, 10, waited for his interview with his sister, Shannon, 14, and their parents. Their mother, Sophia, left her job as a financial analyst to spend more time with the family; their father, Kirkpatrick, is the senior minister at the Lenox Road Baptist Church in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Shannon, who was accepted as A Better Chance scholar last year, is a ninth grader at Poly Prep Country Day School, a mostly white school in Bay Ridge. Kirk, a fifth grader in a gifted program at Public School 279, a mostly black school in Canarsie, is hoping to join his sister there.  Kirk and Shannon's parents say the quality of public schools in Canarsie has declined in recent years as the neighborhood changed from mostly white to mostly black. P.S. 279 still posts high test scores, but it is badly overcrowded. Some children attend classes in an annex a few blocks away, and some classes are as large as 32 pupils. Several years ago, the school had a leaky roof and moldy classroom walls.  David Cantor, a spokesman for the city's Department of Education, said overcrowding and adequate maintenance were issues citywide, acknowledging that some classes at P.S. 279 have 32 students.  Poly Prep has a 25-acre campus, protected by a gate. It has a whole building dedicated to the study of science; one floor has physics labs, another has chemistry labs, and two floors have biology labs. The school has a professional-looking theater for student productions. It even has a pond with ducks -- 262 by one count.  ''You can sit around the pond and do your homework,'' Shannon said. ''It doesn't look like you're in Brooklyn. There's grass and trees. It's getting a breath of fresh air in the middle of the city.'' But what struck her most is the class size. ''There are 10 students in the class and you get lots of individual attention.''  Shannon was also accepted at Bronx High School of Science, but declined the spot because, her parents said, it was too far from home, and, with classes of 34 students, too crowded. Her parents pay part of Poly Prep's $27,000 a year tuition, and a scholarship from the school pays the rest.  Shannon's father, who has a Ph.D. in education from Fordham University, said graduates of A Better Chance can be agents for change. ''We want a better life for our children, of course,'' he said. But, he added, ''We're teaching them, whatever God wants you to do, you take it to help others.''  Mrs. Cohall, who attended public schools in Brooklyn, said she had always been a proponent of public education, but was worried about the quality of most public schools in black neighborhoods. ''The expectations are low and the resources are limited,'' she said.  ''If the playing field were level, we wouldn't need this program,'' she continued, referring to A Better Chance.  ''I think these kids are going to help to level it,'' Shannon's father added.  ON EDUCATION Clara Hemphill, a guest columnist, is author of ''New York City's Best Public High Schools.'' Samuel G. Freedman is on vacation.  Correction:  January 4, 2007, Thursday  The On Education column yesterday, about A Better Chance, a nonprofit group that helps minority children apply to private day and boarding high schools, misstated the surname of the president of the group and omitted her middle initial. She is Sandra E. Timmons, not Simmons.  ",

Max's article (Jan. 7) described a good way to help students connect with meaning and a desire to do good. But it's hard to see positive psychology as entirely worthwhile if it values happiness ''at the cost of a full understanding of literature and human complexity.''  Nancy Tilly  Chapel Hill, N.C.  Mark Linkins seems to be describing an established scientific or philosophical truth, as Max quotes him: ''It's preferable to be happy than not, even if that means the potential for creative output is diminished.'' The logic in his astonishing assumption makes a compelling argument for lobotomies.  Robert Edwards  Swarthmore, Pa.  ",

                    "text": "  Research studies financed by the food industry are much more likely to produce favorable results than independently financed research, a report to be published today said.  The report, in the peer-reviewed journal PLoS Medicine, is the first systematic study of bias in nutrition research.  Of 24 studies of soft drinks, milk and juices financed by the industry, 21 had results favorable or neutral to the industry, and 3 were unfavorable, according to the research led by Dr. David S. Ludwig, director of the Optimal Weight for Life Program at Children's Hospital Boston and an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School.  Of 52 studies with no industry financing, 32 were favorable or neutral to the industry and 20 were unfavorable. The biases are similar to findings for pharmaceuticals.  Bias in nutrition studies, Dr. Ludwig said, may be more damaging than bias in drug studies because food affects everyone.  ''These conflicts could produce a very large bias in the scientific literature, influence the government's dietary guidelines which are science based,'' he said in an interview. ''They also influence the advice health care providers give their patients and F.D.A. regulations of food claims. That's a top-order threat to public health.''  The American Beverage Association, which sponsored at least one study in the article, said the authors had their own biases.  ''This is yet another attack on the industry by activists who demonstrate their own biases in their review by looking only at the funding sources and not judging the research on its merits,'' the president of the trade group, Susan K. Neely, said in a statement.  The new study looked at research published in scientific journals from 1999 to 2003. Studies of milk, juice and soft drinks were chosen, Dr. Ludwig said, because they deal with a controversial area that involves children and highly profitable products.  Of 206 articles, 111 reported their sponsors. Two investigators with no knowledge of the sponsors, who wrote or published the articles or even the articles' titles classified their conclusions as favorable, neutral or unfavorable to the industry.  Another investigator, with no knowledge of the articles' conclusions, determined the financing sources and whether or not the sponsors stood to gain or lose from favorable conclusions.  A study of carbonated beverages in 2003 published in The International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition and financed by the American Beverage Association when it was known as the National Soft Drink Association found that boys with high weights did not consume more regular soft drinks than boys who were not overweight but did consume more diet soft drinks.  The soft drink industry has cited the study to bolster its position that soft drinks are not related to obesity.  ''My co-authors and I rely heavily on scientific method in order to make sure we do not have bias in our studies,'' said Richard A. Forshee, the lead author of that study and deputy director at the Center for Food, Nutrition and Agriculture Policy at the University of Maryland.  Also in 2003, a study of soft drinks in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found a direct relationship between the number of soft drinks consumed and obesity. Foundations sponsored that study.  ''For people who think science is completely objective, these results might come as a big shock,'' said Prof. Marion Nestle of the Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health Department at New York University.

                    "text": "  Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul called Wednesday for changes in a controversial law that penalizes insults against Turkish identity.  Hrant Dink, the Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor who was assassinated last week, had been convicted under the law late last year. Many Turks say the conviction labeled Mr. Dink a traitor in the eyes of ultranationalist groups and made him a target.  ''We see that in its present version, it causes some problems,'' the foreign minister said of the law, adding that his government supported free speech as long as it did not incite violence.  Mr. Gul's comments suggest that change is not far away; the government consulted civic organizations last year about revisions to the language of the law.  In the wake of Mr. Dink's slaying, calls to revise the law, Article 301 of the penal code, began with the chairman of Parliament, Bulent Arinc, when he said Saturday that he was in favor of a move against the law.  The law, which carries a jail term of six months, has been applied mostly against intellectuals, like the Nobel laureate in literature Orhan Pamuk, who have commented about the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Army in the 1910s. Virtually anyone tried under the law, convicted or not, has drawn public threats and hate mail from ultranationalists.  In his last article in the Agos newspaper, which he founded, Mr. Dink expressed his fear of the threats but, according to security officials, did not request protection. Mr. Pamuk, the novelist Elif Safak, who was also tried under Article 301, and others were provided security this week, news reports said.  More than 50,000 people poured into Istanbul streets on Tuesday to protest the killing, in the largest public commemoration in the city since the death of President Turgut Ozal in 1993. Many political analysts and friends of Mr. Dink considered the huge outpouring to be an opportunity to introduce political efforts to improve relations between Armenia and Turkey.  Such efforts were given a head start this week when the Foreign Ministry extended invitations to the spiritual leaders of Armenians around the world and to the Armenian deputy foreign minister, Arman Kirakossian, whose attendance at the funeral was the first time that a ranking Armenian official had come to Turkey since the two countries froze diplomatic relations in 1993 and closed their border.  Mr. Kirakossian, impressed by the size and the diversity of the crowd that attended three days of public protests and the funeral, said Armenia was unconditionally ready to revive diplomatic relations, the semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported.  His statement was partly echoed in Mr. Gul's carefully worded statement in Ankara. ''Today, we improve our relations with all our neighbors on the basis of mutual trust and respect,'' Mr. Gul said. ''Of course we wish to improve relations also with Armenia.''  Diplomatic ties were severed during a dispute over Nagorno Karabakh, a region that Armenia claims but that Turkey recognizes as part of Azerbaijan. But the true heart of the dispute is over the Armenian genocide, in which more than one million Armenians died from 1915 to 1918.  Turkey's stance on Nagorno Karabakh has been that a governmental history commission should be formed to analyze the issues. Armenia has expressed a willingness to take part in a discussion but has insisted that the border be reopened to trade first.  Ogun Samast, the 17-year-old suspect in Mr. Dink's death, was formally arrested Wednesday. His lawyer, Levent Yildirim, assigned by the Istanbul Bar Association, told reporters that his client regretted killing Mr. Dink.  Yasin Hayal, an ultranationalist who had spent 11 months in jail for the bombing of a McDonald's restaurant in Trabzon in 2004, was also formally arrested Wednesday with three other suspects who had been detained and investigated for suspected links with the killing, NTV reported.  As he was escorted into the prosecutor's office in Istanbul, Mr. Hayal hurled threats about Mr. Pamuk.  ''Orhan Pamuk should be careful!'' he yelled at cameras.  Correction:  January 31, 2007, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the future of relations between Turkey and Armenia following the funeral for Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor killed in Istanbul on Jan. 19, misidentified the issue between the two countries that Turkey has said should be examined by a governmental history commission. It is the 1915 Armenian genocide -- not the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region that Armenia claims but that Turkey recognizes as part of Azerbaijan.  ",

                    "text": "  Introduced on Sunday: 2008 Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Caravan minivans  Is it real? These boxy-looking new minivans are the long-awaited fifth generation production models. Really.  What's the point? Though sales are fading quickly, minivans are still relatively big sellers at the Chrysler Group, which essentially invented the segment 24 years ago.  What they said: In a poke at Ford and General Motors, Thomas W. LaSorda, chief executive of the Chrysler Group, said, ''If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen -- we're about to turn up the heat in the minivan kitchen.''  What they didn't say: The minivan segment has never really recovered from Chrysler's killing of Plymouth and the very popular Voyager minivan in 2001. Minivan-based crossovers are the next big thing.  What makes it tick? Either a 3.3-liter flexible-fuel V-6 bolted to a four-speed automatic transmission, or choices of a 3.8- or a 4.0-liter V-6 (with 240 horsepower) coupled to a minivan-first six-speed automatic.  How much, how soon? The new minivans should start around $20,000 and top out at $40,000 loaded (with geegaws like swiveling seats, plug-in tables and two separate DVD systems) when they appear this fall as '08 models.  How's it look? The interiors are high-tech and very entertaining. The exteriors? Yawn.  FIRST GLANCE  ",

                    "text": "  The Nets squandered double-digit leads in the fourth quarter and lost each of their first two games of their trip out West, a reflection of their inability to maintain a steady course this season.  The letdowns, 1-point defeats to the Sacramento Kings on Monday night and the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, came on the heels of a four-game winning streak that had the Nets at .500 for the first time in two months. They have followed each apparent turning point this season with a misstep.  With their season past the midway point, the Nets (20-22) were still trying for their first road victory against a Western Conference opponent when they played the Los Angeles Clippers (20-21) on Thursday night.  After the game against the Warriors, ''the mood was not good,'' Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said Thursday morning. ''If you're a competitor, as a player or as a coach, you're very upset about that, about losing two games like that, games that you had in hand.''  Perhaps most disheartening for the Nets is that their five-game trip was getting more difficult. They play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night and the Utah Jazz on Monday.  ''Virtually every game, we're playing a better team,'' Thorn said. ''We've got our work cut out for us.''  Against the Kings, the Nets held a 20-point lead in the third quarter, only to have it evaporate at the hands of Sacramento point guard Mike Bibby, who capped a strong fourth quarter by making the winning shot with 10 seconds remaining.  ''We just quit playing,'' Thorn said. ''We just stood around in the fourth quarter.''  The Nets led the Warriors by 11 points with a little more than four minutes remaining, but Golden State finished the game on a 17-5 run, capped by guard Monta Ellis hitting the winner at the buzzer. It was the seventh time this season the Nets had lost after squandering a double-digit lead.  ''It is hard,'' Nets forward Bostjan Nachbar said after the game. ''It is not easy. We had both games won. We thought we were the better team, at least most of the game. We lost the game down the stretch, and the next couple games will show how tough we are.''  The Nets' grit will have to start with their two stars, Jason Kidd and Vince Carter. That is especially true with their third top-flight player, Richard Jefferson, out for about six weeks after he had arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle Monday.  Kidd has been stellar all season, playing some of the best basketball of his career, but he had eight turnovers against the Warriors.  Carter, after leading by 214,000 votes the last time they were counted, was surpassed in the All-Star voting by the Washington Wizards' Gilbert Arenas for an Eastern Conference starting spot Thursday. Arenas beat out Carter by 3,010 votes, the smallest margin in 17 years. Carter has been voted a starter six times.  Before Thursday night's game, Carter pretended to have thought he had beaten out Arenas. After sarcastically acting as if his feelings were hurt, Carter said he would not be disappointed to go the game as a reserve.  ''It's still an honor to be involved in it,'' he said.  For now, Carter has more pressing things to think about. He scored only 8 points against the Kings. Despite having 23 points and a career-high 13 assists against the Warriors, he did not dominate down the stretch.  The injuries to Jefferson and center Nenad Krstic, who is out for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, have probably affected Carter more than any other player because he faces more double-teams.  As the Nets have struggled this season, Carter has seemed to be the most likely candidate for a trade if Thorn chooses to make drastic changes. Carter can opt out of his contract at the end of the season, meaning the Nets may try to get someone in return for him if they feel he may leave.  But with the Nets' recent success -- they had won 9 of 11 games before losing to the Kings and the Warriors -- much of the trade talk seemed to have settled.  The Nets' ability to make any significant trades by the Feb. 22 deadline could be hampered by the fact that two of their biggest assets, Jefferson and Krstic, are injured.  ''When you're talking about trading, you trade from assets,'' Thorn said. ''If you don't have a lot of assets to trade, it's difficult to make anything but a minor trade.''  BASKETBALL  ",

Researchers followed 965 Medicare recipients 65 or older for an average of six years, administering diet questionnaires to estimate their intake of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, and performing medical examinations at about 18-month intervals. Members of the study group lived in northern Manhattan, were largely Hispanic and black, and had high levels of diabetes, hypertension and other vascular risk factors. Alzheimer's developed in 192 of them.  After adjusting for age, hypertension, current smoking and other variables, those in the highest one-quarter in total folate intake, from both diet and supplements, were 50 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's than those in the lowest one-quarter. There was no significant association of Alzheimer's risk with dietary folate alone, or with vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 intake.  Dr. Jos\u00e9 A. Luchsinger, the lead author and an assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at Columbia, said there was nothing definitive in these results.  ''This study is observational, not a clinical trial,'' he said. ''It builds evidence and suggests hypotheses, but should not be used to recommend treatment.''  The authors, writing in the January issue of The Archives of Neurology, suggest that folate lowers blood levels of homocysteine, which may decrease the risk of brain atrophy. It may also be that folate reduces the risk for cerebrovascular disease, which is another potential pathway for Alzheimer's.  VITAL SIGNS: RISK REDUCTION  ",

Fradkov, announced that Russia had agreed to lower significantly an export duty on oil to Belarus. Russia had imposed a duty of $180 per ton on oil shipped to Belarus, but agreed to lower it to $53 after the conflict prompted a halt in supplies to Europe through the Druzhba, or Friendship, pipeline, according to news accounts. Belarus on Wednesday agreed to drop a tit-for-tat fee it had imposed in response to Russia's new duty, causing Russia to close the pipeline. Belarus has refined subsidized Russian oil and resold it at significant profit. Belarus will continue to receive a subsidy, but Mr. Fradkov said the new agreement, which appeared to end the dispute between the countries, would still raise $1 billion for Russia.

Three centers did not translate handbooks into Spanish and other languages. Homeland security officials said the study was too small to be representative of the country's detention centers.

Declining just a half-million viewers from its record Tuesday start, the second night of ''Idol'' gave Fox one of its highest-rated Wednesdays ever. For the night, Fox once again trounced its competition, faring 79 percent better among adults 18 to 49 than NBC, ABC, CBS and CW combined. CBS was No. 2 for the night, as ''Criminal Minds'' at 9 (13.4 million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10 (13.7 million) drew solid audiences. CBS's ''Armed and Famous'' (6.1 million) finished third in the 8 p.m. hour, behind two episodes of ''According to Jim'' on ABC (6.9 million).  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

                    "text": "  For more than two years after Saddam Hussein's fall, the war in Iraq was about chasing down insurgents and Al Qaeda in Iraq. Last year it expanded to tamping down sectarian warfare.  Over the past three weeks, in two sets of raids and newly disclosed orders issued by President Bush, a third front has opened -- against Iran.  Administration officials say the goal is limited to preventing Iranians from aiding in attacks on American and Iraqi forces inside Iraq. But in recent interviews and public statements, senior members of the Bush administration have made it clear that their agenda goes significantly further, toward foiling Iran's dream of emerging as the greatest power in the Middle East.  In an interview on Friday, before she left on her latest Middle East trip, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described what she called an ''evolving'' strategy to confront ''destabilizing behavior'' by Iran across the region. Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said Sunday on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' that the United States was resisting an Iranian effort ''to basically establish hegemony'' throughout the region.  Even some of Mr. Bush's fiercest critics do not question that the administration's conviction that Iran's ambitions are large is correct. A few midlevel administration officials wondered even in 2003 whether Iran was a far more potent threat than Mr. Hussein.  Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, administration officials argued that deposing Mr. Hussein would send a powerful signal to Iran and North Korea, the two countries that Mr. Bush identified along with Iraq in his 2002 State of the Union address as part of an ''axis of evil.''  ''You heard this argument in meetings all the time,'' a senior official on the National Security Council, who has since left the administration, recalled recently. ''Iraq would make the harder problems of Iran and North Korea easier.''  But the opposite happened. North Korea tested a nuclear device in October. And Iran has sped ahead with a uranium enrichment program.  Now, despite the urging of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to engage with Iran, Washington is moving in a more confrontational direction. It is stationing more naval, air and antimissile batteries off Iran's coast; has persuaded many international businesses to cut off dealings with Iran; and it has interfered with Iranians inside Iraqi territory.  ''The administration does have Iran on the brain, and I think they are exaggerating the amount of Iranian activities in Iraq,'' Kenneth M. Pollack, the director of research at the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution, said Sunday. ''There's a good chance that this is going to be counterproductive -- that this is a way to get into a spiral with Iran that leads you into conflict. The likely response from the Iranians is that they are going to want to demonstrate to us that they are not going to be pushed around.''  Administration officials say ignoring Iran's activities will only lead to escalation with the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ''There's no question that everything that has gone wrong in Iraq has made life easier for the Iranians,'' one senior White House official said recently. ''The question is what you do about that.''  The answer, shaped in the National Security Council, is for the American military to make targets of Iranians whom they believe are fueling attacks, a decision that Mr. Bush made months ago that was disclosed only last week.  At least twice in the last month, in raids in Iraq that have infuriated officials there, American soldiers have detained Iranians. On Sunday, Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, called for the release of five Iranians taken in the most recent raid, which occurred early on Thursday in Erbil. On CNN's ''Late Edition,'' he said that while the five were members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the group ''in fact is part of the Iranian political system.''  The potential strategic split with the Iraqi government over how to handle the Iranians is only one of the questions raised by Washington's new approach. First among them is whether the effort will stop at Iran's borders. In Congressional testimony, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates has said that he sees no need to enter Iranian territory.  Yet American officials have been careful not to rule out the possibility of American actions inside Iran. Pressed on the ABC News program ''This Week'' on Sunday about excluding the option of going after Iranians inside Iran, Mr. Hadley said that for now, Iraq was ''the best place'' for the United States to take on the Iranians.  ''So, you don't believe you have the authority to go into Iran?'' the host, George Stephanopoulos, asked.  ''I didn't say that,'' Mr. Hadley responded. ''This is another issue. Any time you have questions about crossing international borders, there are legal issues.''  A second question is whether Mr. Bush will step up covert as well as overt efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program. So far, the evidence collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency suggests that Iran's nuclear efforts have run into technical obstacles, but concerns remain that inspectors are missing secret facilities. A third question is what Washington would do if the Iranians looked for ways to strike back.  Escalating tensions are the fear of American allies in the region, who worry about Iran, but worry more about provoking it.  On Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney argued that America's actions were intended to protect allies in the Persian Gulf -- though it is far from clear that Iran's Sunni Arab neighbors have signed on to the strategy. ''If you go and talk with the gulf states or if you talk with the Saudis or if you talk about the Israelis or the Jordanians, the entire region is worried,'' Mr. Cheney said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' He described how the Iranians ''sit astride the Straits of Hormuz'' and its oil-shipping channels, and how they support Hamas and Hezbollah.  ''So the threat that Iran represents is growing,'' he said, in words reminiscent of how he once built a case against Mr. Hussein. ''It's multidimensional, and it is, in fact, of concern to everybody in the region.''  THE REACH OF WAR: NEWS ANALYSIS  ",

                    "text": "  There was doubt last week whether Giants tight end Jeremy Shockey would play, but he started in Sunday's 23-20 first-round playoff loss against the Philadelphia Eagles.  Early in the game, it was not clear how effective Shockey would be. He caught an 8-yard pass in the first quarter but he frequently limped after plays because of a left ankle injury he sustained two weeks ago.  In the second quarter, he looked more like the Shockey of old.  With the Giants trailing by 10-7, quarterback Eli Manning completed a short pass to Shockey on first down. Shockey's helmet flew off as he was hit by an Eagles defender, but he remained on his feet and stretched the play into an 11-yard reception that gave the Giants a first down at their 42.  With his helmet still off, he distanced himself from the players near him and then spun the ball on the Lincoln Financial Field grass. Shockey the showboat was officially back.  Two plays after that reception, the Giants faced a third-and-2 at midfield. Manning again looked to Shockey, who kept the drive alive by reaching for a pass and gaining 6 yards and a first down at the Eagles' 44.  On the next play, Tiki Barber rode the momentum that Shockey had generated, running for 41 yards.  Shockey was unable to corral a lob from Manning near the left corner of the end zone three plays later, and the Giants settled for Jay Feely's 20-yard field goal to tie the score, 10-10.  Shockey finished the first half with a team-high three receptions for 25 yards. Unfortunately for the Giants, Shockey did not add to those numbers in the second half. He had a total of three catches in last year's 23-0 playoff loss to the Carolina Panthers.  Shockey played in every game in the regular season except the finale, a 34-28 road victory against the Washington Redskins that sealed a playoff berth for the Giants. Shockey was injured six days earlier going for a pass from Manning in a 30-7 loss at home to the New Orleans Saints. His swollen and sore left ankle kept him out of practice until last Wednesday.  Shockey said last week that he would do everything in his power to play against the Eagles and help erase the memories of last season's loss to the Panthers. But the few first-half plays he made Sunday were not enough to accomplish that.  PRO FOOTBALL  ",

                    "text": "  WHEN I last had fondue, it was at a bustling place in Geneva, where the supercilious waiter knew we were tourists and treated us accordingly. I declared then that I wouldn't be craving bread dunked in melted cheese for a very long time.  A very long time turned out to be 16 months. But this time I didn't have to endure an all-night flight and navigate a foreign language. Pheasants Landing, which has a Swiss chef, Andre Gross, serves a fine fondue and several other tasty dishes as well.  The restaurant is owned by Heinz Keller, who closed his Auberge Swiss in Berkeley Heights in 2001 to open this party-friendly place in Hillsborough the following year, according to Vicky Starace, the manager. Set well off the road and surrounded by lawns, it is brightly lighted and easily seen from a distance. Parking is plentiful, but first-timers are left wondering how to get in, because there are no signs directing diners to the entrance, in the back.  Inside, the mood warms considerably. Floors are honeyed wood, lighting is hearthlike, and rooms are home-scale.  A cheese fondue seemed equally cozy, and it was. Spiked with Kirschwasser (a cherry liqueur) and white wine, it was served with bread and apples for dipping, and did double duty as food and conversation piece. There's a proper way to stir fondue, with a queenly wave, a figure-eight motion, to keep it from sticking on the bottom, said one member of our party. Then there was the discussion of etiquette surrounding the retrieval of food gone missing in the depths.  Appetizers, which lent themselves to less social interaction, were successful anyway. They included a duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 with its fruity Cumberland sauce and accompanying salad of celery and walnuts; roasted red peppers over fresh mozzarella, drizzled with a basil vinaigrette; and Swiss onion soup, topped with Emmenthal cheese.  The Caesar salad was more compelling than the Greek version, possibly because the Parmesan used in the Caesar was more noticeable than the feta in the Greek. Crab cakes were overly seasoned and overworked, with no visible chunks of meat; house-made spinach dumplings were delicately flavored, once they had been fished from their sea of sauce. The pasta encircling a pheasant filling in the ravioli special, however, was less than tender.  Main dishes were more consistent, particularly the European specialties: the slab of tender sauerbraten, marinated steak, in brown gravy, accompanied by a heap of steaming hot spaetzle and marinated red cabbage; the hunter schnitzel, a tender disc of fried veal served with a typical Burgundy-mushroom sauce, again with cabbage and spaetzle; and the wiener schnitzel, the fried veal without the gravy.  There were a few standouts among the game specials, which are offered in winter and change weekly. Venison stew was delicious, the meat made tender by a red wine marinade and braising with mushrooms, pearl onions and bacon and served with more of the spaetzle. A close second was the game sampler, which included a sweetish smoked duck sausage infused with apple brandy, a tender venison loin and wild boar medallions wrapped in bacon.  A New York strip steak was nicely cooked as well, though the garlic mashed potatoes seemed rote next to the beautiful, golden-brown, crisp-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside r\u00f6sti, a Swiss version of hash browns that was enriched with bacon and onions. Pheasant, however, was a disappointment, overcooked and dry on two separate visits.  Among the many menu items I didn't try, the fish and chips, made with cod in a beer batter, is atop my list. The best bet for dessert is not the house-made apple strudel, which had a floppy crust and steaming filling, but Mr. Gross's walnut and caramel-fudge tart. Order it when you place your meal order and ask the server to allow your piece to sit out of the refrigerator during dinner. That way the flavors enhance each other -- just the way the satisfying food at Pheasants Landing complements a winter evening.

''When I get mad I go to her,'' John, 11, said amid the lunchtime buzz in the cafeteria of his school, Public School 105, on the Rockaway peninsula in Queens. ''When I feel frustrated I'll go to her. When I feel like I can't do it no more I go to her, and she tells me I have to do it.''  Miles away at Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, a 6th- through 12th-grade school, teachers keep the sixth graders looking forward, toward college. One recent morning, a class peppered a guidance counselor, Michael Lloyd, with queries, from ''Where is Harvard?'' to ''What does Ph.D. stand for?''  The two schools, in disparate corners of the nation's largest school system, are part of a national effort to rethink middle school, driven by increasingly well-documented slumps in learning among early adolescents as well as middle school crime rates and stubborn high school dropout rates.  The schools share the premise that the way to reverse years of abysmal middle school performance is to get rid of middle schools entirely. But they represent opposite poles in the sharp debate over whether 11- through 13-year-olds are better off pushed toward adulthood or coddled a little longer.  Should the nurturing cocoon of elementary school be extended for another three years, shielding 11-year-olds from the abrupt transition to a new school, with new students and teachers, at one of the most volatile times in their lives?  Paul Vallas, chief executive of the Philadelphia school system, thinks so, and he has closed 17 traditional middle schools since 2002, while converting some three dozen elementary schools into K-8s. ''The fifth to sixth grade transition is just too traumatic,'' he said. ''At a time when children are undergoing emotional, physical, social changes, and when they need stability and consistency, suddenly they're thrust into this alien environment.''  Others argue that 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds thrive in the presence of older role models and reminders of concrete goals, like playing varsity sports and getting into college.  ''Kids are forward-looking -- they don't get nostalgic for second grade when they're in third grade,'' said Larry Woodbridge, principal of the Secondary School for Law in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where the award-winning high school debate team will teach a middle school social studies unit this spring.  K-8 schools, which prevailed 100 years ago, are the more popular alternative in this debate, cropping up from Philadelphia to Baltimore to Milwaukee to New York. (In New York, which has more than 200,000 sixth- through eighth-grade pupils, most are in traditional 6-8 schools.)  But it is not clear that the shift back into elementary schools makes much of a difference in keeping students from losing their way academically.  Researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that students at Philadelphia's established K-8 schools outperformed students at traditional middle schools, but that those schools had fewer poor and minority students and more experienced teachers, which could have largely explained the results.  In Philadelphia's newer K-8s, which are more similar demographically to the city's middle schools, students performed slightly better than at middle schools, but those advantages were not always statistically significant.  ''The bump in student achievement that administrators may achieve in converting to K-8s may not make as big a difference as they would hope for,'' said Vaughan Byrnes, one of the Johns Hopkins researchers.  The 6th- through 12th-grade school is less common, and less studied. In New York City, where such schools have proliferated -- 38 have opened since 2002 -- the shift is being driven largely by nonprofit organizations that have helped start new, small schools. These schools are under pressure to show they can produce better results than traditional ones.  In many ways these schools were conceived less as a solution to the middle school problem than as solutions to the high school problem -- that is, the problem of having just four years to work magic with woefully underprepared freshmen.  ''It's been an amazingly difficult foot race to get kids from where they are coming in at ninth grade to college-ready, and I just wanted more time,'' said Richard Kahan, president of the Urban Assembly, a city nonprofit group that started creating high schools and has since switched to 6-12 schools, hoping to open three more in September.  Both 6-12 and K-8 schools eliminate one transition from students' lives. Both also tend to have far fewer sixth- through eighth-grade students than the typical middle school -- a difference that those who work with middle school students say cannot be underestimated.  ''One middle school student is like three high school students in terms of their behavioral needs and the issues you're confronted with,'' said Fred Walsh, principal of the School for International Studies in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.  Mr. Walsh said he spent more time dealing with his 170 middle school students, like a sixth-grade boy who recently broke into tears after his science teacher asked him to switch seats, than his 300 high schoolers.  Still, some middle school experts argue that school reconfiguration is a costly distraction from what adolescents really need: smaller classes, an engaging curriculum, personalized attention and well-prepared teachers. ''Creating schools with varying grade configurations, K-8s and 6-12s, will not guarantee that middle-grades teachers and students will be successful,'' said Patrick Montesano, who runs a national middle school improvement program at the Academy for Educational Development, a nonprofit organization.  Experts are not the only skeptics. Mr. Woodbridge often finds himself on the defensive among parents terrified to send their fifth graders into the same hallways as high school seniors. And when P.S. 105 was converted from an elementary school into a K-8, some teachers balked at the thought of pubescent preteens in the same school as kindergartners. Indeed, P.S. 105 starts even earlier, with a prekindergarten program.  But many have since come around, sometimes after seeing how their former students return to them for comfort or advice. When a seventh-grader had the shock of getting her first menstrual period during school one day, she turned to her third-grade teacher, Bonnie Petrone, who welcomed her to womanhood in a classroom decorated with snowflakes and smiley faces.  ''It's a comfort zone,'' Mrs. Petrone explained.  When a student cut school and left the building last year, his absence was noticed more quickly than it might have been in middle school, and a half-dozen staff members searched the neighborhood and worked the phones before tracking him down at home.  ''They know me -- my house, my rules,'' said Laurie Shapiro, the principal, explaining why such offenses are a rarity.  As for her students, Katty Martinez, 15, relishes being a role model ''to the little ones.'' Christopher Pike, 8, gets to watch his brother, Marques, 14, play basketball in the school gym.  While the first day of sixth grade can be stomach-churning when a transition to a new school full of strangers is involved, for Kendearia Kingston and Taaliba Chalmers, it was no more traumatic than any other first day of school. The girls, now seventh graders, said their lives were complicated enough without switching schools. ''There's a lot of issues going on,'' Kendearia, 12, said.  ''Boyfriend issues,'' Taaliba, 13, elaborated.  But Cal Lopez, 11, said that being in the same school with prekindergartners made him ''feel like a baby.'' And Anthony Kuar, a fifth grader, said he was ready to move on from P.S. 105, where crayon renditions of snowmen line a hallway, the principal's office is packed with Winnie the Pooh knickknacks, and middle school students switch classes -- but mostly within one wing of the third floor.  ''I want my own locker, with a combination,'' Anthony, 11, groused.  At Frederick Douglass Academy, by contrast, the walls are lined with posters of university campuses, photographs of last year's senior prom, and gold-trimmed sheets of paper listing where each member of the Class of 2006 was admitted to college (the standout: Breeana Moore, who settled on Brown after being admitted to 25 others).  ''I can absolutely get all these kids to college if I have them for seven years,'' said the principal, Gregory Hodge. ''The school is geared toward one thing: getting your students into college, and it starts in grade six.''  Teachers say students who enter Frederick Douglass as ninth graders, after middle school elsewhere, are often behind academically and chafe at aspects of the school culture, like being called ''Mr.'' and ''Miss'' and having to wear navy blue and white uniforms every day.  Antonia Singleton, 18, said the uniform was easy to digest as a sixth grader, because ''your mom is still dressing you at that time.'' By ninth grade, she said, it was just part of life.  In the cafeteria one recent day, the age chasm was evident. As Kabresha Glover, 11, giggled with her friends over Cheez-its and chicken fingers -- ''There's a lot of drama in the sixth grade,'' she noted -- Jack Boampong, 17, and his friends debated the execution of Saddam Hussein.  While the models differ, in both P.S. 105 and Frederick Douglass, the principals have spent hours orchestrating schedules, staffing and traffic patterns to ensure that contact between their oldest and youngest students is limited, and supervised.  When Frederick Douglass teachers noticed an 11th grade boy and an 8th grade girl holding hands, ''We nipped that in the bud,'' Dr. Hodge said, adding, ''You also have to make sure they emulate the right behavior.''  And so, when a $100,000 college scholarship winner was congratulated on the Frederick Douglass loudspeaker in the middle of John DePasquale's English class, he briefly stopped his lesson.  ''In five years,'' he told his seventh-grade charges, ''I want to hear your name.''

                    "text": "  Warsaw's new archbishop, Stanislaw W. Wielgus, caught in Eastern Europe's widening witch hunt for former Communist secret police informers, admitted Friday that he had collaborated with the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, known as the S.B.  ''Before you today, I confess to the mistake committed by me years ago, just as I have confessed to the Holy Father,'' Bishop Wielgus said in an open letter to Polish Catholics. ''By the fact of this entanglement, I have damaged the church.''  He said he compounded that damage by denying ''facts of this cooperation'' in recent days.  Bishop Wielgus insisted, however, that he had neither spied on anyone nor harmed anyone. He said the only thing he ever did was to inform the secret police of his agenda during foreign academic meetings and to promise not to take part in anti-Communist activities.  He said it was up to Pope Benedict XVI to decide whether he would keep his new job, which he took up Friday.  The bishop is to be officially elevated to archbishop during a ceremony on Sunday in Warsaw at St. John's Cathedral, though many voices in Poland have called for him to step down.  The Warsaw archbishopric is a particularly symbolic institution in the former Soviet bloc. The Polish church, together with the Polish-born Pope John Paul II, were crucial supporters of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement, which helped bring down the totalitarian system and end the cold war.  Confirmation that the archbishop collaborated is doubly troubling because the Polish secret police murdered a charismatic anti-Communist priest from the archdiocese, the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, in 1984. Warsaw's departing archbishop, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, waged a quiet battle with the Communist Party in those years.  Many historians argue that a significant segment of the clergy in Poland and other Eastern bloc countries collaborated to varying degrees with the secret services. Priests have recently been added to those segments of society under scrutiny in several countries during recent efforts to expose former Communist collaborators.  Two years ago, files surfaced showing that the Rev. Mieczyslaw Malinski, who had been close to John Paul II, worked for the S.B. in the 1980s. Several other prominent priests have since been accused of having been informers, and some have admitted that they had links to the secret police. The Polish church publicly apologized last year for priests who collaborated with the S.B., but has tried to keep their names secret.  The uproar over Bishop Wielgus's past began shortly after Pope Benedict picked him in early December to succeed Cardinal Glemp as Warsaw's archbishop. A Polish daily newspaper, Gazeta Polska, reported Dec. 20 that the bishop, 67, had spied on dissidents and fellow clerics for more than two decades, until Communism collapsed in 1989.  Both Bishop Wielgus and the Vatican sought to deflect the accusations by saying his involvement with the secret police had been nothing out of the ordinary for people traveling abroad during the Communist era. Leading representatives of the Polish clergy denounced the accusations against him.  But Poland's human rights ombudsman, Janusz Kochanowski, said Thursday that there was evidence in the secret police archives that Bishop Wielgus had knowingly cooperated with Communist authorities. Rzeczpospolita, one of Poland's most respected newspapers, published documents showing that he had met with police agents more than 50 times in one five-year period.  Even Poland's Catholic Church Historical Commission issued a statement on Friday, saying, ''There are numerous, substantial documents confirming Stanislaw Wielgus's willingness for a conscious and secret cooperation with the Communist security forces.''  The commission said that there was no evidence that Bishop Wielgus's actions harmed anyone, and that the documents would be sent to the Vatican for further study.  Monsignor Wielgus first admitted Friday that he had signed a cooperation statement with the secret police in 1978 under pressure by a ''brutal intelligence officer'' when he was seeking permission to travel to Munich. ''That was my moment of weakness,'' he wrote.  But he accused the secret police of falsifying documents that cast him as a more eager, useful collaborator than he actually was.  ''The personality ascribed to me in the intelligence service documents is so far from the truth that I would never have recognized myself,'' he wrote.  Those claims are not far-fetched. Almost from the moment the Iron Curtain fell, the nations of the former Communist bloc have been steeped in controversies over the files of their secret police forces. The documents are often elliptical and incomplete, and were sometimes embellished by secret police officers eager to impress their superiors, experts say.  The documents published by Rzeczpospolita and other newspapers suggest that Bishop Wielgus was recruited by the S.B. in 1967 when he was a philosophy student at the University of Lublin in eastern Poland, more than a decade before he signed the cooperation agreement. Newspapers cited other documents in which the S.B. claimed he had given them information about activities at the university, where he later served as a professor of medieval philosophy.  The newspapers claimed that some documents referred to Bishop Wielgus by the code names Grey, Adam and Adam Wysocki. They said he received training and was rewarded for his collaboration with a grant to study in Munich.  Later Friday, Bishop Wielgus issued another statement, which was broadcast by Vatican Radio's Polish service, in which he said he had collaborated so that he could travel abroad for his academic research.  ''I'm not trying to justify anything, I know that I shouldn't have had any relations with the Communist regime's secret services,'' he said. ''At the time I thought I had to continue my important scientific research and acquire sound training for the good of the church.''  The Vatican has continued to support the embattled prelate.  ''The Holy See, in deciding the nomination of the new archbishop of Warsaw, took into consideration all the circumstances of his life, including those regarding his past,'' the Vatican said in a statement on Friday, repeating the position it has taken for the past month.  The statement said Benedict ''has every confidence in Bishop Stanislaw Wielgus and in full conscience entrusted him the mission of pastor of the archdiocese of Warsaw.''  ",

                    "text": "  In March, necessity moved Carmen Laureano and her two daughters from Florida to New York City.  Ms. Laureano, 36, lost her job when the day care center where she had worked for about three years came under new ownership. ''Everything changed for me; everything was down,'' she said.  She moved with her girls, Luz and Franchesca Rivera, 12 and 10, to the Bronx, hoping to stay with her mother. But the young family could not stay in her mother's housing complex for the elderly. She and the girls quickly found themselves homeless and entered the shelter system.  ''For the people living in the shelter it's not that easy to get out,'' Ms. Laureano said. But she did. With persistence, determination and some help from Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, Ms. Laureano has made a new city her family's new home.  In June, they moved into a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, and Ms. Laureano gave the bedroom to her daughters so they ''could have privacy.'' Framed family photos hang in the living room, where Ms. Laureano sleeps.  For a year, the $925 monthly rent is covered by Housing Stability Plus, a Department of Homeless Services program that offers a five-year subsidy that decreases gradually each year. Ms. Laureano is already worried about paying next year's rent.  ''I'm going to start studying because in one year I have to work,'' she said. Since moving here in the spring, Ms. Laureano has spent her time finding housing, schools and medical services for her family and caring for her daughters. She plans to take computer classes with the help of Catholic Charities. ''I have to start paying rent by myself.''  Her willingness to work is real, but so are her worries. Caring for Franchesca takes a special effort. ''Franchesca is a special girl,'' Ms. Laureano said. A lack of oxygen to her daughter's brain during birth caused mild mental retardation and behavioral problems. Ms. Laureano must be home when Franchesca returns from school. ''I have to be here, at 3; I have to be downstairs,'' she said.  Finding the right school to meet her daughter's needs was also a challenge. When they arrived in New York, Franchesca was mistakenly put in mainstream classes.  ''My daughter was in regular class and it was a mess,'' Ms. Laureano said. Franchesca was disruptive and could not do the work. ''It was hard for her, for the teacher, for the students.''  Ms. Laureano found help and a feeling of home, at the Thorpe Family Residence in the Bronx, where the family lived while it was homeless. The Thorpe residence is affiliated with Catholic Charities, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Thorpe staff connected Ms. Laureano to the services she needed. ''They give you support,'' she said. ''They help you out a lot. They are like a family.''  Counselors at Thorpe referred her to medical and educational services for Franchesca, and Ms. Laureano did considerable work following through. ''I have to start from the shelter, then I have to talk with the social worker to see if she could help me,'' she said, ''I went to two schools before I get that school.''  The school is Public School 161, where Franchesca started in the fall. She is in Spanish-language special education classes with her peers, working at a first-grade level. The family is from Puerto Rico, and Ms. Laureano taught herself English in Florida. Luz, in the sixth grade, speaks both Spanish and English, but is in some bilingual classes to provide better comprehension.  Franchesca, who speaks Spanish, was crying on the first day. But, by the second day, ''she was the friend of the teacher,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Being taught in Spanish and working with children at her level has made a big difference for Franchesca.  ''Mommy, Mommy, I know how to read!'' Ms. Laureano remembered her daughter announcing one day after school. The family celebrated, ''We made a party,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Ms. Laureano was also referred to a clinic for her daughter's mental health issues, and Franchesca received new medication to control her behavior. Now, Franchesca is calm and more focused, Ms. Laureano said. ''She could really learn. She could hear. Without the medication she just wants to fight.''  The family's monthly income is limited to $145 in public assistance and $255 in food stamps. With the help of staff members at Thorpe, Ms. Laureano is applying for Social Security supplemental income for Franchesca.  Two weeks after school began, the family received $425 in Neediest Cases money for school clothes, shoes, socks and underwear. The family also bought four folding chairs to put around a dining table. ''Thank you for all the help,'' Ms. Laureano said.  Franchesca is shy around strangers. She stayed in the bedroom and sometimes hid under the covers. She is not shy with her family. ''No way,'' Ms. Laureano laughed. ''It's different when we three are alone.''

                    "text": "  In Thursday's column you had the chance to pick West's opening lead against a small slam. Now you can select something against a grand slam, seven spades. What would be your choice?  On Thursday Harold Rosenson of West Palm Beach, Fla., led a low trump from queen-doubleton against a small slam. This imaginative choice did not generate a trump trick, but it defeated the contract when declarer failed to play double-dummy. Any side-suit lead would have made declarer's task easy.  That column resulted in a small flurry of e-mail messages. During an open trial in the '70s, someone led low from queen-doubleton of trump against a grand slam. After dummy played low, his partner would not put up the king from king-doubleton, so the grand made.  In the '80s a player underled king-doubleton of trump against a grand slam, confident the ace was on his left. There was bad news, good news and bad news. Dummy did not have the trump ace; it was nestling in declarer's hand -- ugh. But partner had queen-doubleton of trump -- aah. After dummy played low, so did third hand -- ugh, ugh.  And another player in the '80s underled king-doubleton of trump against a grand slam. There was good news, better news and best news. The ace was in the dummy. Partner had queen-doubleton. And after dummy played low, partner eventually put up the queen to hold the trick. Attempts to find these full layouts have failed -- memories get hazy over the decades.  These deals do highlight an advantage of Roman Key Card Blackwood, which uncovers not only the four aces but also the trump king and trump queen. These ''no-play'' grand slams are now avoided.  The diagramed deal occurred during the 1977 Bermuda Bowl world team championship in Manila. It was described in ''Trump Leads'' by Dr. George Rosenkranz (Devyn Press, 1986). North's three-spade rebid was forcing. South, not playing Roman Key Card Blackwood, blasted into seven spades.  If South had been using that convention, he would have known that the trump queen was missing and presumably would have settled for six spades. But there is a strong case for bidding seven anyway. It has always been traditional to lead a trump against a grand slam. So if West leads a trump, it picks up the queen for you. And if West leads a side suit, declarer plays him for the trump queen.  South would presumably have done that here -- except that the American expert Mike Passell did lead a low trump. Declarer, thinking East must have the spade queen, called for dummy's ten, taking the trick. Then he cashed dummy's ace -- and ruefully nodded his head when East discarded.  Presumably West has led from two or three low trumps, or from four to the queen. Perhaps South should have led dummy's low trump at Trick 2. If East follows suit, South puts in his nine -- an interesting way to play in a grand slam. But when East discards, declarer can win with his king and finesse on the way back through West.  In the other room, Passell's teammates stopped in six spades, so his team gained 14 international match points instead of losing 11.  Bridge  ",

                    "text": "  MANY investors have been heeding market strategists' advice to reduce portfolio risk by putting more money into stable, high-quality, dividend-paying stocks.  But instead of plowing this money into large-capitalization companies based in the United States, investors have redirected much of it into shares of blue-chip foreign companies based largely in Western Europe and Japan.  Indeed, foreign large-cap blend funds -- which primarily invest in blue-chip growth and value stocks in developed markets -- were the most popular category of funds through the first 11 months of 2006, according to the Financial Research Corporation in Boston.  Foreign large-blend funds attracted $43.8 billion of net new money during this stretch. By comparison, highflying diversified emerging-market stock funds attracted $6.6 billion and domestic large-blend funds drew $4 billion, according to Financial Research.  But does investing in blue chips abroad achieve the same results for a portfolio as investing in big, high-quality domestic stocks?  The answer is still no, given the currency risks that you inevitably take on when investing abroad. Yet a growing number of people argue that foreign and domestic stocks are becoming more alike, given the increased correlation among the world's markets.  Since 1970, for example, the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index, for European, Australian and Far Eastern stocks, has returned 11.6 percent a year, on average. That is nearly identical to the annualized gain of 11.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of domestic blue chips.  But keep in mind that those slightly higher gains came with slightly higher risk, as foreign stocks on their own are still more volatile than domestic equities.  Sometimes, a modest dose of a risky asset can make an entire portfolio less volatile. From 1970 to 2005, a 100 percent stock portfolio invested in the S.& P. 500 would have earned 11.1 percent, annualized, according to S.& P. And that is with a so-called standard deviation -- a popular measure of volatility -- of 16.8. But by moving 25 percent of that money from the S.& P. 500 to the EAFE index, the portfolio would have earned 11.4 percent a year, on average, with a slightly lower standard deviation of 16.4.  Add too much, however, and more volatility enters the mix. In this case, had 75 percent of the equity stake been invested in the EAFE index and 25 percent in the S.& P. 500, the portfolio would have earned the same 11.4 percent, annualized, from 1970 to 2005. But the portfolio's volatility would have shot up to 19.1.  This shows that while the global markets may be moving more in sync, ''the world markets aren't completely integrated yet,'' said James D. Peterson, vice president of the Schwab Center for Investment Research in San Francisco.  Consider the recent performance of foreign and domestic blue chips. Over the last five years, the average foreign large-blend fund returned 13.8 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracker, as many foreign economies have grown faster than that of the United States and as the dollar has weakened of late.  By comparison, domestic large-cap blend funds advanced only 6.3 percent a year, on average, during this stretch. And last year, foreign blue-chip funds soared 25.1 percent, beating the returns of domestic blue-chip funds by more than 10 percentage points.  Arguably, much of the investor interest in foreign blue chips can be attributed to their outperformance, not to their similarities to their domestic counterparts.  ''A lot of people just want to be exposed to foreign because it's been doing so well,'' said Ronald W. Rog\u00e9, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y. ''It's performance chasing.''  To be sure, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the EAFE index has been 0.8 over the last three years, according to Morningstar. On paper, that is fairly high, because a correlation of 1.0 implies that two assets are moving in perfect tandem.  But consider that over this same stretch, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the Russell 2000 index of small domestic stocks was actually greater, 0.83, according to Morningstar. Yet investors take it on faith that large-cap and small-cap stocks are entirely different asset classes.  There are several reasons for continuing to treat foreign and domestic blue-chip stocks separately. ''A big reason is the issue of currency,'' Mr. Peterson said.  Investors who put money to work in a foreign market should consider that market's volatility, as well as that of the currency in which its stocks trade.  In 2006, the EAFE index rose 13.8 percent when measured in local currencies, according to MSCI. But for Americans to make an investment abroad, money must first be converted from dollars to those local currencies to buy the securities. And when it comes time to sell, the money has to be reconverted back into dollars.  In dollar terms, the EAFE index actually returned much more last year: 23.5 percent. That is because the dollar lost value against the euro. A weakening dollar is a tailwind for Americans investing abroad because each share of their foreign stock becomes worth that much more in dollars.  SO isn't this good news for domestic investors? It certainly was last year. But what happens if the dollar turns around this year and appreciates, as it did in 2005?  In that case, investors could see a big chunk of their foreign stock market gains evaporate -- even if the global stock markets are highly correlated -- simply because the dollar gained value.  This is one reason that investors should always assess several factors in the risk and return of a particular stock, said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in the investment counseling and research department at the Vanguard Group. These include its industry, its value or growth orientation, its market cap and the region where it operates.  ''While issues of style and cap size are always important, in many cases they would be secondary to geographic regions,'' Mr. Kinniry said, because stocks will always be affected by their regional economies and local currencies.  In other words, while geography may not be as important a subject as it used to be for investors, it is still one to be studied.  FUNDAMENTALLY Paul J.

                    "text": "  Twenty three schools in Westchester failed to meet requirements outlined by the federal No Child Left Behind law, including four schools that were newly identified as in need of improvement, the State Education Department announced last week.  They are Ossining High School, Greenburgh Eleven High School in Dobbs Ferry, Sleepy Hollow Middle School in Tarrytown and School 23 in Yonkers.  Schools are designated in need of improvement when students do not show enough progress on statewide tests in English and mathematics. For the first time this year, schools were judged on the scores of students in the third, fifth, sixth and seventh grades, in addition to fourth, eighth and 11th graders. Not only must schools show improvement over all, but they must also meet achievement targets for component groups, like racial categories and special education.  Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act, schools that receive federal money must replace administrators or close schools if they do not improve after several years. Roosevelt High School and Emerson Middle School in Yonkers have already reorganized, and two other Yonkers middle schools, Commerce and Museum, are planning to do so this year.  ''We made the decision to redesign Roosevelt so it became two schools, with designated administrative staff for each,'' said Jerilynne Fierstein, spokeswoman for the district. ''The idea is to personalize the instruction and stay more focused on the curriculum.''  The state also removed three schools from the list because of improvements in scores, including two high schools in Yonkers, Lincoln and Gorton, that reversed several consecutive years of failure. ''We are thrilled,'' Ms. Fierstein said. ''It was quite an accomplishment for the staffs of those schools.''  Schools that do not receive federal money are not subject to No Child Left Behind sanctions, but are required to meet state demands for improvement if their students do not meet targets. Twelve of the 23 failing schools are on that list, which is referred to as ''schools requiring academic progress.''  THE WEEK  ",

By the numbers, Republicans were already at a disadvantage. Twenty-one Republican seats will be open, compared with 12 Democratic seats. And not having a Republican incumbent on the ballot in a competitive state like Colorado complicates matters for Republicans.  Already, campaign politics is infusing substantive debates on Capitol Hill. Many of the incumbent Republican senators who have stepped forward to oppose President Bush's Iraq policy face re-election. (Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon started the trend late last year, followed by others, including Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota last week.) Even before Mr. Allard's announcement, Colorado was emerging as a gateway to the West for Democrats, who have won the governor's office, two House districts and a Senate seat in the last four years. Those successes helped seal the Democratic Party's decision to hold its 2008 national convention in Denver. And now, the state will be host to one of the most closely watched Senate races in the nation, too.  JEFF ZELENY  POLITICAL ACTION  ",

                    "text": "  The Nets will be without Richard Jefferson, their starting small forward, for about six weeks after he has arthroscopic surgery today to remove loose fragments from his right ankle.  Jefferson is the team's second-leading scorer, and the news comes during one of the Nets' most promising stretches of the season. They beat the Orlando Magic on Saturday night for their ninth victory in 11 games and got back to .500 for the first time in two months.  The Nets (20-20) start a five-game trip to the West on Monday night with a game against the Kings in Sacramento. The trip could be an indicator of what direction the Nets, the leaders of the Atlantic Division, will take for the remainder of the season.  Jefferson, who has been bothered by ankle problems all season, chose to have the surgery now because his ankle was not getting better, said Rod Thorn, the Nets' president. Jefferson took two cortisone shots earlier this season, and Thorn said they were not working. Having the surgery now avoids the possibility of Jefferson's ankle becoming so bad that he would have to miss the rest of the season.  ''He's just not able to do the type things that he can do,'' Thorn said during a telephone interview yesterday. ''He's playing about 50, 55 percent. It's tough for him. He's a young guy, still in the early part of his career. It's mentally a tough situation.''  If Jefferson recovers in six weeks, he should be back by early March, when the Nets have a six-game trip.  Coach Lawrence Frank said his team needed to find a way to cope with Jefferson's absence.  ''Injuries happen throughout the course of the season, so regardless of how you're playing, where you're playing, that's the unfortunate reality of pro sports,'' he said by telephone.  Regardless of who plays in place of Jefferson, Frank added, ''We understand we have to be consistent.''  Jefferson missed five games early in the season after rolling his left ankle, and the second-year swingman Antoine Wright started in his place.  But Wright has fallen out of the rotation and Frank said he was not sure who would replace Jefferson. Frank said matchups could dictate his starting lineup, which may change from game to game.  Jefferson was averaging 16.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists this season, all below his career averages. But he seemed to be battling through the pain and was showing flashes of his usual explosiveness. In a victory against the Knicks on Friday night, he scored 21 points.  Many credited Jefferson's improved play at times for the team's turnaround from an 11-18 record.  Jefferson's problems date to last season's playoffs, when he sprained his right ankle in the second round against the Miami Heat. He tweaked the ankle again in the off-season. The problems with the ankle resurfaced during a game against the Milwaukee Bucks in mid-December. Jefferson sat out the second half of that game because it was sore, and he missed the next game, at Toronto.  Jefferson, 26, has always prided himself on his ability to play through pain, and the nagging injury has frustrated him.  Last month, Jefferson said of his statistics: ''We're looking at some of the lows of my career. It's not acceptable.''  And after Saturday night's game, Jefferson dismissed a question about whether he would make the trip, saying: ''You're not asking me any questions about this. Come on, guys.''  Thorn said he did not believe that Jefferson's ankle problems would threaten his career.  Jefferson will be the fifth Nets player to have surgery this season. The most serious injury has been to their starting center, Nenad Krstic, who will miss the rest of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in late December. Krstic was the Nets' second-leading scorer at the time of his injury.  ''You can't lose players like Richard now, on top of Nenad,'' Thorn said. ''It's going to affect your team, obviously. We are just coming into one of the most difficult periods of our schedule. The players are going to have to play an increased role.''  PRO BASKETBALL  ",

                    "text": "  Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage house, capped a record earnings season for the major brokers yesterday by announcing a 68 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit.  Merrill's results, like those of its peers, were propelled by a buoyant market for mergers and acquisitions, especially buyouts, and strong results from trading and principal investments.  With the fourth-quarter results in, banks up and down Wall Street are looking more like Goldman Sachs, the competitor that everyone may love to hate but tries to imitate.  At Goldman, where fourth-quarter profit soared 98 percent, more than 64 percent of its profit last year came from trading and principal investments.  Merrill Lynch's results are starting to reflect that trend.  In the fourth quarter, investment banking and principal transactions, including net interest profit, constituted 57 percent of total net revenue, compared with only 45 percent of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005.  ''Trading has become a bigger part of Wall Street's business,'' said Jeffrey Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners.  Over all, Merrill earned $2.35 billion, or $2.41 a share -- sharply higher than forecasts -- compared with $1.37 billion, or $1.41 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The firm also increased its dividend 40 percent, to 35 cents a common share.  Merrill shares fell $1.41, to $95.40 in trading yesterday.  On a conference call with investors, Jeffrey N. Edwards, Merrill's chief financial officer, said the results put Merrill on ''the strongest competitive footing ever as we enter 2007.''  Later, in an interview, he said: ''The most encouraging thing is the continued growth in the pipeline. It's up from the third quarter and is the highest period end pipeline we have ever had.''  For the year, Merrill reported record net earnings of $7.5 billion, up 45 percent from the previous year, on record revenue of $34.7 billion.  For the fourth quarter, trading and investment banking reported revenue of $5.4 billion, up 55 percent from the quarter a year ago and up 21 percent from the third quarter. Fixed-income revenue was up 70 percent, to $2.3 billion, while equity revenue increased 49 percent, to $1.8 billion.  Debt and equity underwriting surged, but strategic advisory services dropped a surprising 18 percent from the previous year to $286 million. Revenue in the Global Private Client business, part of global wealth management, increased 10 percent, to $3.1 billion.  Merrill attracted $22 billion in new client money, up from $17 billion a year ago, bringing total assets managed to $1.5 trillion.  ",

With the help of new investors, she has also opened T Salon, which serves teas and tea-based snacks on the lower level of the sleekly modern T\u00e9 Casan shoe store at 382 West Broadway (Spring Street), above right.  Ms. Novalle plans to open another T Salon in the Chelsea Market, 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street), in about eight weeks.  It will have tea for sale, a full bar for tea-based cocktails, snacks developed by Allan Susser of Miami, and a machine that makes a satisfyingly frothy tea cappuccino at the touch of a button.

According to Nielsen's estimates, the Day 6 debut earned 15.7 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m. Sunday, a slight decline over its year-ago season premiere (16.2 million). However, Monday's two-hour second installment also drew 15.7 million viewers, a modest improvement over the fifth season's second episode (14.9 million). CBS was No. 1 on Sunday, benefiting from an overrun of its N.F.L. playoffs coverage, followed by an interview with President Bush on ''60 Minutes'' at approximately 8:30 (17.2 million). ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' (16.7 million) also outdrew ''24'' during the 9 p.m. hour Sunday. On Monday, NBC's telecast of the 64th annual Golden Globes led during every half-hour of the night and averaged 20 million viewers over all, that award show's highest ratings in three years. NBC fared less well Sunday as the second week of ''Grease: You're the One That I Want'' at 8 (8.2 million) and ''The Apprentice'' at 9 (7.3 million) fell to fourth place.  BENJAMIN TOFF  ",

                    "text": "  Players in duplicate tournaments win only master points, no prizes. And they strive to attain the rank of life master. You must gain 300 points, at least 50 being silver points, which can be won only in sectional tournaments. Earlier this month the Greater New York Bridge Association ran a ''STaC'' -- for Sectional Tournaments at Clubs -- week. These pair events were played simultaneously in the clubs across the city.  The diagramed deal was played Jan. 18, and it helped Justine Cushing and Barry Rigal of New York to second place behind Joan Hight and Phyllis Young, also of New York.  When you uncover a good fit with your partner, the strength of your hand increases. There are two commonly used methods of evaluation. First, you can add points for short suits. Here each doubleton is worth one point, giving North a total of nine. This would suggest raising to two spades, with the intention of accepting a game-try by partner, or of competing to three spades if the opponents enter the auction.  Second, you can use the Losing Trick Count. You look at no more than the first three cards in every suit, counting one loser for each top honor missing. The North hand has eight losers: three spades, two hearts, one diamond and two clubs. This makes the hand worth a game-invitational raise to three spades, which was the bid chosen by Cushing. (Perhaps the best approach with a borderline hand is to underbid slightly in a pair event, where you do not push for thin games, but to overbid in a team event or Chicago, where you bid game with any excuse.)  A club, heart or high-spade start would have defeated four spades, but West had a natural diamond lead. (She was using Rusinow leads, so selected the jack, the second-highest of touching honors.)  Declarer immediately discarded two heart losers on dummy's top diamonds, then called for a club. East went up with his ace, cashed the heart ace and continued with the heart king. South ruffed, took his top trumps and club king, ruffed a club on the board (West discarded a diamond) and trumped a diamond in his hand to give this unusual finish:  When did you last see four singleton queens in a three-card end position?  South led his club jack, leaving West with no winning play. If she had ruffed, declarer would have crossruffed the last two tricks. If West had thrown the heart queen, declarer would have ruffed the club jack on the board and trumped a diamond in his hand. And when West pitched her diamond queen, South ruffed on the board and discarded his last club on the high diamond nine.  Bridge  ",

''I am running for president,'' Mr. Biden said toward the end of an appearance on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC.  ''I'm going to be Joe Biden, and I'm going to try to be the best Biden I can be,'' he said. ''If I can, I got a shot. If I can't, I lose.''  He said he would file paperwork by the end of the month to establish an exploratory committee to gather support for his bid.  Mr. Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972, also sought the presidential nomination in 1988. But he dropped out of the race after admitting that he had used speeches by other politicians without attribution, and after reports that he had plagiarized while in law school.  Mr. Biden, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, joins a widening field of Democratic presidential hopefuls. The others who have officially announced their candidacies are former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa.  Other potential Democratic contenders include Senators Hilary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois. Among Republicans, Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, are expected to run.  ",

Sainthood and martyrdom should not be prerequisites for successful teaching in high-poverty schools. While many teachers qualify on both counts, that is not the sine qua non for making a difference in a child's life.  Effective teachers will tell you they need smaller class sizes and a safe, adequately staffed, supportive environment where they are treated as professionals and asked for input.  That's what we fight for every day; and it's the least we can do to help our teachers help our students.  Randi Weingarten  President  United Federation of Teachers  New York, Jan. 22, 2007  ",

I've been visiting Charleston for 15 years, I even honeymooned here, and it's a place where I've always wanted to own a home. I looked for years, but of course the closer I got to the city center, the higher the cost. I discovered this little gem about a year ago. It's 320 square feet with a 100-square-foot courtyard. When I bought it, it needed work. I redid the bathroom, since the only thing holding it up was the tile, and turned the full kitchen into a kitchenette.  The biggest thing in the apartment is the fireplace. It's 84 inches, while the kitchenette is only 54 inches across. But a big fireplace is part of the historic nature of this 200-year-old building. It's only two rooms but proved to be the hardest two rooms I've ever had to decorate. Though it's the smallest unit in the building, I wouldn't think about giving up my courtyard for a bigger space.  I live at the beach, so when I want to get away, I come here. We're two and a half hours away and make it here about twice a month. Generally my husband, Ron Cooper, and I will arrive late on a Friday night. We park the car out front and don't move it again until we leave at the end of the weekend. The condo is right on Queen Street, so we can walk to shopping on King Street and to restaurants. Charleston has a growing gallery district, and we are right in the heart of it. But when I first arrive, I just love to spend time in our home.  I never say I have a place in Charleston. I don't want people to think that I have a mansion in the city or one of the newer, grand apartments, so instead, I always say that I have ''a space'' in Charleston.

                    "text": "  On paper, Gov. Jon S. Corzine may well get what he wants from the Legislature: a bill limiting annual increases in revenues from local property taxes to 4 percent.  But the proposed measure, which is most likely to be introduced in the Senate on Thursday by his fellow Democrats, is sprinkled with an array of exemptions, adjustments and waivers to the 4 percent limit.  That part of the measure seems intended to quiet some of the grumbling among local officials that they would bear the cost of easing the burden of property taxes on homeowners, yet it also falls short of what those officials have said is needed to make the governor's plan more equitable.  ''Look, we are really talking about whittling away at a portion of the tax levy for municipal services which in my town represents just 9 percent of the entire levy,'' said Louise C. Wilson, deputy mayor of Montgomery Township, adding that the rest of the tax levy goes to the local school district, which would have its own set of exemptions. ''And I know that if you start to grant so many exemptions, you're not going to have any cap.''  For one thing, some local finance officers said the provisions would not have an immediate effect because they would not be in place by July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, and that in the long run the exemptions could jeopardize the entire effort.  Last week, in a session sponsored by the League of Municipalities, Mr. Corzine defended a 4 percent limit on annual increases in revenues from local property taxes, saying that local governments needed to find alternative sources of revenue. But by the end of the session, after several mayors complained, he warmed to the notion of allowing exemptions and waivers in some cases.  In the measure to be introduced on Thursday by the Senate president, Richard J. Codey, money set aside to cover uncollected property taxes, revenue realized from new properties on the tax rolls, a small portion of pension costs and increases in health benefits are automatically exempted.  In addition, school districts would be allowed automatic adjustments for debt service, a portion of the costs associated with increased enrollment or the opening of a new school as well as capital outlays. The school districts would also be allowed adjustments for debt service and emergencies.  The measure would also allow local governments to apply each year to the Local Finance Board or the state commissioner of education for waivers from the 4 percent cap for extraordinary circumstances like a loss of state aid, the sudden infusion of nonrecurring revenue, one-time emergency spending for ''health, safety and the public welfare,'' and cost increases resulting from mandated spending and increases in energy costs above the cap level and in equipment leases.  The decisions of the finance board and the commissioner could not be appealed.  Lou Neely, the finance director of East Brunswick, who is also the expert on property tax reform for the state League of Municipalities, called the proposed property tax measure a grab bag.  Mr. Neely said that many of the exemptions made sense, although he added that they would slow any immediate benefits to taxpayers. He said the state would be flooded with waiver requests from municipalities and school districts without a mechanism to handle them. After all, he said, ''when you are hungry and somebody throws you a crumb, you grab it.''  Local officials complained that the legislation did nothing to mitigate the costs of awards in binding arbitrations, which occur after municipalities and unions reach an impasse in labor negotiations. Localities would be required under the bill to pay the costs associated with these awards regardless of the 4 percent cap on local property taxes.  Mr. Neely and other officials wanted either a state-ordered limitation on the awards, or a provision in the bill to exempt the awards from these caps. Without such an exemption, he said, money would have to be diverted from other items financed from the property tax to pay for these awards. The proposed legislation admonishes arbitrators to ''consider as a primary factor in their awards'' the effect on tax levy limitations. Similarly, it addresses increases in employee health costs faced by local governments, and encourages local officials to renegotiate contracts.  Mr. Neely said that the ''state has precluded us from reopening contracts in the past, and it is nice that they are now letting us do it.''  ''But,'' he added, ''they ought to say to arbitrators that this is a hard cap and you can't grant awards over it.''  Still, most local officials conceded that the measure would be approved.  Mayor Gary Passanante of Somerdale said property taxes would not ease up any time soon, primarily because they account for about 46 percent of local budgets, more than the national average of 30 percent.  Borrowing phrasing frequently used by Governor Corzine, Mr. Passanante said: ''Our benchmark for accomplishing reform that is for the common good is doing something that gets us closer to the national average of 30 percent. But nothing in the governor's package does this.''  POLITICAL MEMO  ",

                    "text": "  WHEN I last had fondue, it was at a bustling place in Geneva, where the supercilious waiter knew we were tourists and treated us accordingly. I declared then that I wouldn't be craving bread dunked in melted cheese for a very long time.  A very long time turned out to be 16 months. But this time I didn't have to endure an all-night flight and navigate a foreign language. Pheasants Landing, which has a Swiss chef, Andre Gross, serves a fine fondue and several other tasty dishes as well.  The restaurant is owned by Heinz Keller, who closed his Auberge Swiss in Berkeley Heights in 2001 to open this party-friendly place in Hillsborough the following year, according to Vicky Starace, the manager. Set well off the road and surrounded by lawns, it is brightly lighted and easily seen from a distance. Parking is plentiful, but first-timers are left wondering how to get in, because there are no signs directing diners to the entrance, in the back.  Inside, the mood warms considerably. Floors are honeyed wood, lighting is hearthlike, and rooms are home-scale.  A cheese fondue seemed equally cozy, and it was. Spiked with Kirschwasser (a cherry liqueur) and white wine, it was served with bread and apples for dipping, and did double duty as food and conversation piece. There's a proper way to stir fondue, with a queenly wave, a figure-eight motion, to keep it from sticking on the bottom, said one member of our party. Then there was the discussion of etiquette surrounding the retrieval of food gone missing in the depths.  Appetizers, which lent themselves to less social interaction, were successful anyway. They included a duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 with its fruity Cumberland sauce and accompanying salad of celery and walnuts; roasted red peppers over fresh mozzarella, drizzled with a basil vinaigrette; and Swiss onion soup, topped with Emmenthal cheese.  The Caesar salad was more compelling than the Greek version, possibly because the Parmesan used in the Caesar was more noticeable than the feta in the Greek. Crab cakes were overly seasoned and overworked, with no visible chunks of meat; house-made spinach dumplings were delicately flavored, once they had been fished from their sea of sauce. The pasta encircling a pheasant filling in the ravioli special, however, was less than tender.  Main dishes were more consistent, particularly the European specialties: the slab of tender sauerbraten, marinated steak, in brown gravy, accompanied by a heap of steaming hot spaetzle and marinated red cabbage; the hunter schnitzel, a tender disc of fried veal served with a typical Burgundy-mushroom sauce, again with cabbage and spaetzle; and the wiener schnitzel, the fried veal without the gravy.  There were a few standouts among the game specials, which are offered in winter and change weekly. Venison stew was delicious, the meat made tender by a red wine marinade and braising with mushrooms, pearl onions and bacon and served with more of the spaetzle. A close second was the game sampler, which included a sweetish smoked duck sausage infused with apple brandy, a tender venison loin and wild boar medallions wrapped in bacon.  A New York strip steak was nicely cooked as well, though the garlic mashed potatoes seemed rote next to the beautiful, golden-brown, crisp-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside r\u00f6sti, a Swiss version of hash browns that was enriched with bacon and onions. Pheasant, however, was a disappointment, overcooked and dry on two separate visits.  Among the many menu items I didn't try, the fish and chips, made with cod in a beer batter, is atop my list. The best bet for dessert is not the house-made apple strudel, which had a floppy crust and steaming filling, but Mr. Gross's walnut and caramel-fudge tart. Order it when you place your meal order and ask the server to allow your piece to sit out of the refrigerator during dinner. That way the flavors enhance each other -- just the way the satisfying food at Pheasants Landing complements a winter evening.

                    "text": "  Afghan and NATO troops clashed with a large group of insurgents crossing from Pakistan into eastern Afghanistan in the early morning hours on Thursday. NATO said up to 150 insurgents might have been killed in the fighting.  Two large groups of insurgents were spotted gathering on the Pakistan side of the border and were tracked as they crossed into Afghanistan, NATO said in a statement released in Kabul.  Afghan Army soldiers and NATO troops laid an ambush for the groups about half a mile inside Afghanistan, using air and ground forces, said Gen. Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.  The insurgents were in trucks loaded with men and weapons and crossed the border about 2 a.m., General Azimi said. Afghan and NATO forces set up an ambush in a deserted area near the border, he said. He reported no Afghan or NATO casualties, but estimated that about 80 insurgents were killed. The clash occurred in the Barmal district of Paktika Province, which borders the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, one of the most lawless areas of the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Militants from both countries, along with hundreds of foreign fighters, operate Taliban training camps there and mount frequent attacks across the border into Afghanistan.  The Pakistani military guards the border but has failed to stem cross-border attacks; NATO officials say there has been a marked increase in infiltration at the border since September compared with last year.  ''Pakistani military liaison officers were kept fully informed throughout the operation,'' NATO said in its statement.  ",

                    "text": "  Toyota is putting its reputation as a premium automaker to a test by pricing its redesigned pickup, the Tundra, several thousand dollars higher than comparable trucks made by General Motors and Ford.  Sticker prices for the bigger and brawnier 2007 Tundra, which goes on sale in mid-February, will begin at $22,290 for the most basic model and go as high as $41,850. The Chevrolet Silverado, which also was revamped for 2007, has a base price of $17,860, while Ford's F-series, the segment's longtime leader, starts at $18,275.  Of the six full-size pickups available in the United States, only the Nissan Titan has a higher starting price, and none has a high-end price greater than the Tundra's. Last year's Tundra ranged in price from $16,155 to $33,575.  Jesse Toprak, an analyst with Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice, said the Toyota pickup cost about $1,100 more than the most popular version of the Chevrolet Silverado, which was introduced late last year.  ''Toyota is confident in their new product. They know their brand strength will probably carry the price point,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''They hope that people who buy this truck will not need a good deal or a high incentive -- they'll buy the vehicle on its merits.''  ''Perhaps that's a little bit arrogant,'' he went on, ''but it's been kind of their continuing strategy.''  Comparing prices for similarly equipped pickup trucks is difficult, because manufacturers offer multiple cab sizes, bed lengths, engine sizes and suspensions.  There are 31 versions of the Tundra and dozens more of the Silverado.  The risk for Toyota will be if consumers conclude it is too expensive after comparison shopping on the Internet. ''They may be out of the consideration sets of some consumers, simply because it has the highest price,'' Mr. Toprak said.  Toyota considers the new Tundra, built in San Antonio as well as Princeton, Ind., to be the most important vehicle it has ever sold in the United States. It expects to sell about 200,000 trucks a year, primarily to owners of other Toyota vehicles who purchased pickups from G.M., Ford and Chrysler.  Automakers sold about 2.3 million big pickup trucks in the United States last year. Sales of the F-series dropped 11.7 percent in 2006, which Ford attributed to a spike in gasoline prices and a slowdown in the housing market, which caused contractors to delay purchasing new trucks.  To counter the shift toward more fuel-efficient vehicles, Detroit's automakers have been offering discounts of several thousand dollars on their pickups, making the price gap between the new Tundra and a truck like the F-series even larger.  A G.M. spokesman, John M. McDonald, said the automaker was confident that the Silverado, which was named the North American truck of the year at this month's Detroit auto show, would have little trouble competing against the Tundra, regardless of the price Toyota sets.  ''It speaks to the fact that American automakers can produce a truck that has the best quality and sell it at a price that is as good as or better than the competition,'' Mr. McDonald said.  ",

Researchers randomly selected 5,008 people older than 50 and followed them for five years. At the start of the study, they interviewed the subjects about medications and general health. The subjects filled out yearly questionnaires reporting fractures caused by falling from a bed, chair or standing height. (A co-author of the study has received grants and honorariums from several drug companies.)  One hundred and thirty-seven people, or 2.7 percent of the subjects, were daily users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, a rate similar to that of the general populations of the United States and Canada. After controlling for the use of other psychotropic medicines, age, sex, education, height, weight, smoking status and other variables, daily users of S.S.R.I.'s were 2.1 times as likely to suffer fractures as those who did not use the medicine. The study  appears in the Jan. 22 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.  ''We're not recommending that people stop their S.S.R.I.'s,'' said Dr. David Goltzman, a professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal and the senior author of the study. ''But people should realize that this is a risk and that they might want to undertake lifestyle changes like participating in exercise and making sure their diet is appropriate in calcium and vitamin D.''  Using S.S.R.I.'s was also associated with an increased risk of falls and with decreased mineral bone density. But after controlling for falls and low bone density, the risk of fracture persisted. The scientists speculated that other pathways leading to impaired bone quality might be at work.  VITAL SIGNS: HAZARDS  ",

Scholars do not so much know the pronunciation of ancient languages as they extrapolate and guess. They have had more success with some languages than with others, said Emily Teeter, spokeswoman for the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, a major center for the study of the ancient Near East. For example, she said, Semitic languages like Babylonian and Akkadian are closely related to ancient Hebrew, providing solid clues about how the other ancient Semitic languages were vocalized.  For ancient Egyptian, the clues are sparser, primarily bilingual inscriptions like the Rosetta Stone. A name may appear in Egyptian and in another writing in pronounceable script, helping in recovering the sounds of certain words. However, the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone lack indications for vowel sounds.  Another set of clues comes from Coptic, still used in Egyptian Christian churches. Coptic is the latest form of ancient Egyptian, Ms. Teeter said, and is believed to preserve many of the ancient sounds. ''It is written in Greek letters, with vowels,'' she said, ''except that it was necessary to import a few signs from Egyptian for sounds that Greek didn't have.''  C. CLAIBORNE RAY  Q & A  ",

This is particularly onerous for many retirees who frequently pay some 20 percent of their pension and Social Security income for property taxes, yet on the block where they live, a wealthier person with the same property assessment may pay only 5 percent of his income for property taxes.  Property taxes are regressive in that payments reflect property values rather than income, thus favoring the wealthy over the middle class and poor.  Reform will not occur through plans to reduce benefits for state employees because the prospect of labor unrest and political retribution in an election year will surely deter legislators from provoking a significant part of the electorate.  The fair and appropriate way to achieve property tax reform is to require those with the highest incomes to pay a higher state income tax and use that money to substantially finance education while reducing property taxes.

                    "text": "  Research studies financed by the food industry are much more likely to produce favorable results than independently financed research, a report to be published today said.  The report, in the peer-reviewed journal PLoS Medicine, is the first systematic study of bias in nutrition research.  Of 24 studies of soft drinks, milk and juices financed by the industry, 21 had results favorable or neutral to the industry, and 3 were unfavorable, according to the research led by Dr. David S. Ludwig, director of the Optimal Weight for Life Program at Children's Hospital Boston and an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School.  Of 52 studies with no industry financing, 32 were favorable or neutral to the industry and 20 were unfavorable. The biases are similar to findings for pharmaceuticals.  Bias in nutrition studies, Dr. Ludwig said, may be more damaging than bias in drug studies because food affects everyone.  ''These conflicts could produce a very large bias in the scientific literature, influence the government's dietary guidelines which are science based,'' he said in an interview. ''They also influence the advice health care providers give their patients and F.D.A. regulations of food claims. That's a top-order threat to public health.''  The American Beverage Association, which sponsored at least one study in the article, said the authors had their own biases.  ''This is yet another attack on the industry by activists who demonstrate their own biases in their review by looking only at the funding sources and not judging the research on its merits,'' the president of the trade group, Susan K. Neely, said in a statement.  The new study looked at research published in scientific journals from 1999 to 2003. Studies of milk, juice and soft drinks were chosen, Dr. Ludwig said, because they deal with a controversial area that involves children and highly profitable products.  Of 206 articles, 111 reported their sponsors. Two investigators with no knowledge of the sponsors, who wrote or published the articles or even the articles' titles classified their conclusions as favorable, neutral or unfavorable to the industry.  Another investigator, with no knowledge of the articles' conclusions, determined the financing sources and whether or not the sponsors stood to gain or lose from favorable conclusions.  A study of carbonated beverages in 2003 published in The International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition and financed by the American Beverage Association when it was known as the National Soft Drink Association found that boys with high weights did not consume more regular soft drinks than boys who were not overweight but did consume more diet soft drinks.  The soft drink industry has cited the study to bolster its position that soft drinks are not related to obesity.  ''My co-authors and I rely heavily on scientific method in order to make sure we do not have bias in our studies,'' said Richard A. Forshee, the lead author of that study and deputy director at the Center for Food, Nutrition and Agriculture Policy at the University of Maryland.  Also in 2003, a study of soft drinks in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found a direct relationship between the number of soft drinks consumed and obesity. Foundations sponsored that study.  ''For people who think science is completely objective, these results might come as a big shock,'' said Prof. Marion Nestle of the Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health Department at New York University.

There are drugs on the streets of their Bronx neighborhood, said Ms. Burton, 70. She lost her daughter to them and vowed not to lose her granddaughter, too.  ''My daughter got involved with drugs at an early age,'' Ms. Burton said. Her daughter, Dana Burton Rivera, was 16 when her mother noticed a change. She started on cocaine and wound up on crack, an addiction it pained Ms. Burton to witness. ''It was like she was kidnapped against her will,'' Ms. Burton remembered.  Brittany was born addicted to cocaine and spent seven weeks in the hospital before she was released to her grandmother. Brittany spent her early years with her grandmother, although her mother lived in the same building and was close by. ''I was 4 or 5 when I lived with my mother,'' Brittany said, ''and that week when I was 6.''  Brittany's mother, Ms. Rivera, got clean at 21. ''Squeaky clean,'' Ms. Burton said. ''When she left it, she left it for good.'' Brittany moved in with her a year or so later, and in January 1998 Ms. Rivera gave birth to twins. But while she had survived addiction, the years of drug abuse had taken their toll.  Ms. Rivera died suddenly, less than two weeks after Brittany's sixth birthday. She went into the hospital with back pain, and died from complications stemming from her years as an addict. ''August the 15th, my child was gone,'' Ms. Burton said. The twins just were 7 months old, and Ms. Burton was heartbroken. ''I loved her beyond human understanding,'' she said. ''They didn't come sweeter than her.''  Brittany now lives with her grandmother, and she carries her mother's high school graduation picture in her wallet. The likeness is striking. Brittany, pleasant and well spoken, is a freshman at St. Michael Academy, an all-girl Roman Catholic high school in Manhattan. Her first report card shows an 85 percent average and positive comments from teachers. On Wednesdays after school, she stays for Global Community, in which students discuss world events.  Catholic school is important to Ms. Burton. She hopes it will help keep her granddaughter safe. ''The environment is better,'' she said. ''Environment to me is very important. I don't see how you can separate a child from environment.''  She feels that the school will provide the discipline that Brittany needs to succeed. Brittany interjected, ''It's important to me -- I like the school.''  But paying for it is a challenge. High school costs $550 a month, and Ms. Burton has not managed to keep up. ''I can pay January,'' she said, but she has fallen about $1,000 behind since school began in September. Making ends meet on her retiree income is a continual challenge. Ms. Burton receives $1,200 a month from the New York Telephone Company, where she worked as an operator until 1991. She also receives $600 from Social Security. Brittany receives $154 a month in Social Security survivor benefits from her mother's death. Their rent is $919 a month, and public assistance covers $300.  After Ms. Burton fell behind on her Consolidated Edison bill in August, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, stepped in to help. It arranged a $200 energy grant from Con Edison, and used $95 of Neediest Cases money to prevent a turn-off. Ms. Burton has again fallen behind, and this month an additional $130 in Neediest Cases money was used to keep the power from being turned off. ''I'm grateful; it's going to help me a lot,'' Ms. Burton said.  This month, Ms. Burton goes to family court to seek custody of the twins, William Brandon Sykes and Breanna Geneva Sykes, who turned 9 on Saturday. Ms. Burton saw them regularly until last year, when their father went into drug rehabilitation. They have been living with their father's partner. ''I want them back in my life pretty regularly,'' Ms. Burton said.  Brittany is looking forward to being older and being able to go to the movies alone, and to talk to boys on the phone. ''Don't rush it, Brittany, it's coming,'' Ms. Burton said.  She is trying to teach her granddaughter as much as she can, now. ''I'm in the evening of my life; she's in the morning,'' she said. ''I'm not going to be with her always. I try to teach her the best I can.''  Ms. Burton is hoping that Brittany will make her way safely through their neighborhood and out into the world beyond. ''It's O.K. for me, you know, 'cause I'm pretty strong,'' she said. ''I want her to get a good education so she can move on.'' But it might take some outside help to keep her granddaughter in the school Ms. Burton thinks best.

                    "text": "  The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York is set to announce today its final list of parishes that will close as part of a far-reaching reorganization plan, bringing to an end a decision-making process that has dragged on for more than five years and trapped many parishioners in uncertainty.  St. Vincent de Paul in Manhattan and St. Mary in the Bronx, among a number of other parishes, are slated to be closed, said a senior priest, who spoke on condition of anonymity because clerics were asked not to discuss the plans before they were announced. But he said that other parishes, including Guardian Angel in Manhattan, that were cited last March in a preliminary list of 31 parishes recommended for closing, appear to have been spared.  In some cases, the parishes will be closed completely and parishioners obliged to go elsewhere, but in other cases smaller churches may be built as chapels for the community, or congregations may be able to keep their buildings and become missions attached to other parishes. But that would mean they would lose many services, like having a priest on site.  The priest characterized the final list as much less draconian than had been feared by many across the archdiocese, which stretches from Staten Island to the Catskills. He said that Cardinal Edward M. Egan appeared to have backed away from taking drastic steps to address the problems that spurred the reorganization, including a shrinking corps of priests and demographic changes that had left many parishes struggling to fill pews while others overflowed.  The pastors of the affected parishes were notified during a meeting on Wednesday with Bishop Dennis J. Sullivan, the archdiocese's vicar general, who has been overseeing the reorganization process since early 2005.  The pastors were asked to keep the decisions secret, however, until an official announcement that is expected at 10 a.m. today during a news conference at Cathedral Girls High School in Manhattan.  Msgr. Gerald Murray, the pastor of St. Vincent de Paul, declined to comment yesterday on the fate of his church but said he was grateful that the announcement was finally coming.  ''We welcome the announcement because January marks five years since our parish was first contacted about being subject to possible closure,'' he said. ''It's been five years that we've been waiting.''  Several parishioners appeared surprised yesterday that the process was actually coming to an end.  ''I thought it was a long-drawn-out process that was never going to conclude,'' said Chuck Van Buren, a parishioner at Nativity Church in Manhattan, which was on the preliminary list.  The reorganization, which will include the creation of several new parishes and the construction of new church buildings in some areas, has long been a delicate task for archdiocesan officials.  Churchgoers are fiercely protective of their parishes, often forming attachments that endure for generations. Many of these churches have also been stalwarts in their neighborhoods for decades. Similar overhauls in other dioceses around the country have resulted in ugly public battles between parishioners and church officials, something archdiocesan officials hope to avoid in New York.  Cardinal Egan originally intended to plunge into the redrawing of parish lines soon after he became archbishop in 2000, but the scandal over sexual abuse by priests made him put it off.  Bishop Timothy A. McDonnell was initially put in charge of ''realignment,'' as it came to be called by archdiocesan officials, but he left to become the bishop of Springfield, Mass., in April 2004, leading to another long delay.  The process got started again in earnest in early 2005, when Bishop Sullivan took over. Cardinal Egan indicated then that the reorganization would be completed by September 2005. But a preliminary list of recommendations for 31 parishes and 14 schools to be closed was not released until March 2006.  After hearing appeals from school officials and parents, archdiocesan officials reduced the list of school closings in April to nine, and then turned to the parishes.  Many endangered parishes were vocal in fighting back, holding vigils and enlisting the help of politicians and the surrounding community. The parish appeal meetings, often emotional, were wrapped up by midsummer.  In August, Bishop Sullivan presented his recommendations to the archdiocese priests' council, and an announcement appeared imminent at that point. But Cardinal Egan's knee operation in the fall further delayed the process.  Meanwhile, parishioners did their best to divine their future. At St. Augustine's in the Bronx, parishioners were heartened in recent weeks when scaffolding went up for repairs to the interior of their church, suggesting that the archdiocese would not take the time to fix up their building if it was going to be closed.  ''Some people said, 'Wow, that's really good,' '' said Claire Harris, a parishioner.  They expect to hear today if it really was.  ",

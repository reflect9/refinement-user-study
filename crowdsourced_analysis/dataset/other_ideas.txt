Honestly, no, I can't think of any.

not sure
I think the system is already pretty good.
Nope! 
I think everything works just fine

Something that could compare lemmas with the same stem would be maybe more useful than "merge words", and less labor intensive.
no 
You could put a number next to each Theme word to represent the # of times the word appears below in the articles.
nope

none
maybe try to only have 5 themes max or something, that way only the major themes are picked up and we aren't bombarded with a ton of choices


None
I'm unsure





no
To be able to move the articles. 

None worth mentioning.

if the computer could check the percentage matched each time a change was made.
No.

No.

Changing the order of the articles.
Perhaps the ability to extract typos or grammatical errors.
Not at the moment, these were all very useful.
No
nothing

Associating Words Like Manning is Associated with both Eli and Peyton. Death is associated with Funeral, Memorial, Etc.
no
not really but this task was a little complicated. Maybe if there were fewer articles it would have been easier to focus

When splitting themes it should be helpful to attach articles to the theme
For me, more practice, otherwise a method to sort through entire articles quickly.
No.
It would help to be able to redefine the theme. Once I was into the articles I felt the theme definition should be changed but I did not have that option.
Maybe reordering articles?
Maybe have the articles below re-arrange themselves depending on how they match the keywords at the top. That way you could visually gauge, as you work, the effect you're having. 
no
A way to split a theme into two where you can move articles into each split theme.
not really seems like a simple process



no
Not with my limited knowledge. 


Identify which articles go in the new theme if you split the theme. Auto-suggest variations of words. 
I don't have any other ideas.
No, I think these tools were enough.
I would like to know how the search engine works - does "book" retrieve "books" also? 

No
I cannot think of anything else that would be useful for refining the themes and articles further.

Can't think of anything
Allow word matching for article titles as well. Allow undo for past actions without having to start over if the correction is early on in the editing process.
No. I did have an issue though while working. I tried to remove some articles and it wouldn't let me do any further work. So I had to quit and restart. It was a glitch I just wanted to mention.  
It would be even more helpful to be able to split the whole theme into two sections to separate articles between, as the conglomerate could often benefit from a divide for the sake of clarity. Thanks!

Would like ability to add headings and subheadings...DEATHS>January, February, March, etc.
All of the refining tools work well.

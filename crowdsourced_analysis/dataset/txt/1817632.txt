bad things, good food   to the editor:  re ''when bad things come from 'good' food'' (jan. 2): dr. christopher braden of the centers for disease control and prevention states that so far, scientists have not found any way to prevent e. coli outbreaks. in stating that feeding the animals grain instead of hay seems to promote its growth, you provide one way to dramatically reduce the potential for contamination -- a return to grass-fed cattle.  in addition, dr. braden states that the centralized processing of produce leads to much wider problems than the limited scope when a local farmer has a problem. by patronizing local farmers (or growing their own), people can reduce their risk of exposure. the same would apply to beef production. when beef is ground into hamburgers in a large processing plant, the potential risk from a rare hamburger would seem to be much greater than when a pound or two of fresh sirloin is ground at a local store.  joshua dubnick  hopatcong, n.j.

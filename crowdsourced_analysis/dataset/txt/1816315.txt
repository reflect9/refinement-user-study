words we understand   to the editor:  re ''chaos overran iraq plan in '06, bush team says'' (front page, jan. 2):  it is galling and condescending that president bush keeps talking about victory in iraq. ''it's a word the american people understand,'' he told members of the iraq study group. ''and if i start to change it, it will look like i'm beginning to change my policy.''  americans also understand the word ''failure,'' and having seen it in iraq, voted resoundingly for a change in policy in november.  janice gewirtz  mountain lakes, n.j., jan. 2, 2007

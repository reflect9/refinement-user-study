baked goods and bedside manner   to the editor:  re ''cookie conundrum in the doctor-patient drama'' (jan. 2): at this season of thanks and well wishes, primary care doctors are bombarded with offerings by everyone from seductive pharmaceutical representatives to most appreciative specialists. the patient-doctor relationship, however complicated and complex, is another story.  although physicians are taught to divorce personal feelings from professional duty, and to avoid emotional intrusions, my experience has not supported this position. honest interaction allows real communication. nothing is more meaningful than something straight from the oven. when a family lovingly hands me such a treat, i don't hesitate to open my heart.  mitchell rubin, m.d.  brooklyn

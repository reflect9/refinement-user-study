national briefing | washington: endorsement for voting machine labs   the national institute of standards and technology has recommended approval of two laboratories for testing electronic voting machines under a new federal oversight program. the institute, part of the commerce department, said systest laboratories and ibeta software quality assurance, both of colorado, were the first to pass examinations, and the federal election assistance commission is expected to grant them full accreditation. voting machine experts have long been concerned about possible conflicts of interests, because the testing laboratories are paid by the companies that make the machines. when the oversight program started last summer, the commission found serious deficiencies at ciber inc. and held up the company's request for temporary certification. officials said ciber was still fixing those problems. ciber and three other companies -- wyle laboratories, infoguard laboratories inc. and bkp security labs -- have also applied for full accreditation.  christopher drew

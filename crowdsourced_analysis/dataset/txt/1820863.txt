thousands of abortion opponents rally on mall   they marched down seventh street on monday chanting, singing and eventually flooding onto the mall to show disapproval on the 34th anniversary of the roe v. wade decision that legalized abortion.  in his annual call to the thousands of abortion opponents at the march for life, president bush, who delivered a telephone message from camp david, said, ''we believe every human life has value, and we pray for the day when every child is welcome in life and protected into law.''  the president told the group, ''we're making progress,'' citing legislation that allows a person charged with killing a pregnant woman to be also charged with harming or killing a fetus.  mr. bush mentioned his signing the partial-birth abortion ban act of 2003, which is before the supreme court in a case to be decided this term.  senator sam brownback, the kansas republican who announced his presidential bid over the weekend, had supporters fan out over the mall to pass out pamphlets proclaiming him as ''proudly pro-life'' and ''a champion of our values.''  after the mall rally, the demonstrators marched up constitution avenue to the supreme court.  this is the first anti-abortion march here since the democrats took control of congress. the change is ''challenging us to fight harder,'' said natalie campbell, 18, who was at the rally with her father and their church group from kokomo, ind.  joe konopa, 19, who traveled here with more than 60 people from three churches in the kokomo area, said, ''they are picking up on the fact that more and more americans, especially the young, are against abortion.''  gail babalonis of hooversville, pa., said which party was in control did not matter.  ''the last eight years have been pro-life, and the only thing they got accomplished is the ban on partial birth abortions,'' ms. babalonis said.

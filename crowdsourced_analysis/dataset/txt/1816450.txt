(ben brantley)  'butley' in this uneasy revival of simon gray's portrait of a toxic english professor, directed by nicholas martin, nathan lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''made in britain'' engraved on them. a less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). booth theater, 222 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'a chorus line' if you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by bob avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). schoenfeld theater, 236 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  * 'the coast of utopia: voyage' the exhilarating first two installments of tom stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. jack o'brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes brian f. o'byrne, jennifer ehle, billy crudup and ethan hawke (2:45). vivian beaumont theater, 150 west 65th street, lincoln center, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  * 'company' fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of john doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of stephen sondheim and george furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated raul esparza. like mr. doyle's ''sweeney todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). barrymore theater, 243 west 47th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'the drowsy chaperone' (tony awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) this small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. but in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. bob martin and sutton foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). marquis theater, 1535 broadway, at 45th street, (212) 307-4100. (brantley)  * 'grey gardens' christine ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called little edie beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. she and the wonderful mary louise wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''grey gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). walter kerr theater, 219 west 48th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  * 'the little dog laughed' the comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the american theater, has actually resurfaced on broadway with all its vital signs intact in douglas carter beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, hollywood style. with the wonderful julie white as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). cort theater, 138 west 48th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'mary poppins' this handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the p. l. travers stories and the 1964 disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. ashley brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like joan crawford trying to be nice and sounds like dr. phil. directed by richard eyre and matthew bourne (2:30). new amsterdam theater, 214 west 42nd street, (212) 307-4747. (brantley)  'les mis√ârables' this premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of victor hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. but its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). broadhurst theater, 235 west 44th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  * 'spring awakening' duncan sheik and steven sater's bold adaptation of the frank wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical broadway has seen in some time. set in 19th-century germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by michael mayer and inventive choreography by bill t. jones (2:00). eugene o'neill theater, 230 west 49th street, (212) 239-6200. (charles isherwood)  'tarzan'  this writhing green blob with music, adapted by disney theatrical productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. the soda-pop score is by phil collins (2:30). richard rodgers theater, 226 west 46th street, (212) 307-4747. (brantley)  'the vertical hour' david hare's soggy consideration of the anglo-american cultural divide stars julianne moore (representing the americans) and bill nighy (leading the british), directed by sam mendes. the yanks don't stand a chance. with his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, mr. nighy mops the floor with ms. moore. actually, he mops the floor with mr. hare's play (2:20). music box theater, 239 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  off broadway  'the big voice: god or merman?' think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. the result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). actors temple theater, 339 west 47th street, clinton, (212) 239-6200. (honor moore)  *'the clean house' sarah ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in new york at last in a gorgeous production directed by bill rauch. blair brown and jill clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and vanessa aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). mitzi e. newhouse theater, lincoln center, 150 west 65th street, (212) 239-6200. (isherwood)  'dai (enough)' iris bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the middle east debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. ms. bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a tel aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. the attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. gimmicky? sure. but viscerally effective (1:40). culture project, 55 mercer street, at broome street, soho, (212) 253-9983. (neil genzlinger)  'evil dead: the musical' this likable horror comedy based on sam raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''rocky horror show.'' to that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). new world stages, 340 west 50th street, clinton, (212) 239-6200. (anita gates)  'the fantasticks' a revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the little musical that wouldn't die. this sweet-as-ever production of tom jones and harvey schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for mr. jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym thomas bruce) as the old actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. mr. jones also directs (2:05). snapple theater center, 210 west 50th street, (212) 307-4100. (brantley)  'jacques brel is alive and well and living in paris' a powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director gordon greenberg. as in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). zipper theater, 336 west 37th street, (212) 239-6200. (isherwood)  'a jew grows in brooklyn' you don't have to be jewish or brooklynish to empathize with jake ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. especially the catskills jokes (2:05). 37 arts, 450 west 37th street, (212) 560-8912. (gates)  'meet me in st. louis' this musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). irish repertory theater, 132 west 22nd street, chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (gates)  'my mother's italian, my father's jewish and i'm in therapy'  steve solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). little shubert theater, 422 west 42nd street, clinton, (212) 239-6200. (gates)  'no child'  teachers will love nilaja sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at malcolm x high school (1:10). barrow street theater, 27 barrow street, at seventh avenue south, west village, (212) 239-6200. (gates)  'an oak tree' tim crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). barrow street theater, 27 barrow street, at seventh avenue, west village, (212) 239-6200. (jason zinoman)  'regrets only' old acquaintance comes under siege in paul rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. but no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that christine baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). city center stage i, 131 west 55th street, (212) 581-1212. (brantley)  'room service' the peccadillo theater company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, dan wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. david edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on broadway, and fred berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). soho playhouse, 15 vandam street, south village, (212) 691-1555. (genzlinger)  'suddenly last summer'  as the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in tennessee williams's famously lurid melodrama, carla gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. mark brokaw directs a cast that includes blythe danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). laura pels theater, 111 west 46th street, (212) 719-1300. (brantley)  '25 questions for a jewish mother' this is the comedian judy gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other jewish mothers (1:20). st. luke's theater, 308 west 46th street, clinton, (212) 239-6200. (phoebe hoban)  'two trains running'  directed by lou bellamy, a rough-edged revival of august wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for african-americans, set in a dying diner in pittsburgh in the late 1960s. the pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of mr. wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). signature theater at peter norton space, 555 west 42nd street, clinton, (212) 352-3101. (brantley)  * 'the voysey inheritance' david mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted harley granville barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of victorian finance. an excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). atlantic theater, 336 west 20th street, chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (isherwood)  off off broadway  't j and dave' the comics t. j. jagodowski and dave pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. this is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) barrow street theater, 27 barrow street, west village, (212) 239-6200. (gates)  long-running shows  'altar boyz' this sweetly satirical show about a christian pop group made up of five potential teen people cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). new world stages, 340 west 50th street, clinton, (212) 239-6200. (isherwood)  'avenue q' r-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). golden theater, 252 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'beauty and the beast' cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). lunt-fontanne theater, 205 west 46th street, (212) 307-4747. (brantley)  'chicago' irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). ambassador theater, 219 west 49th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'the color purple' singing cliffsnotes for alice walker's pulitzer prize-winning novel (2:40). broadway theater, 1681 broadway, at 53rd street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'forbidden broadway: special victims unit' often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th street theater, 304 west 47th street, clinton, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'hairspray' fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). neil simon theater, 250 west 52nd street, (212) 307-4100. (brantley)  'jersey boys'  the biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). august wilson theater, 245 west 52nd street, (212) 239-6200.

(brantley)  'the phantom of the opera' who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). majestic theater, 247 west 44th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'the producers' the ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). st. james theater, 246 west 44th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'rent' east village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). nederlander theater, 208 west 41st street, (212) 307-4100. (brantley)  'slava's snowshow' clowns chosen by the russian master slava polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). union square theater, 100 east 17th street, (212) 307-4100. (lawrence van gelder)  'spamalot'  a singing scrapbook for monty python fans (2:20). shubert theater, 225 west 44th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'the 25th annual putnam county spelling bee' ''a chorus line'' with pimples (1:45). circle in the square, 1633 broadway, at 50th street, (212) 239-6200. (isherwood)  'wicked' oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). gershwin theater, 222 west 51st street, (212) 307-4100. (brantley)  last chance  'becoming adele' eric houston's one-woman show about a young brooklyn waitress's journey to self-actualization imagines a new york where fairy tales are possible even for the very ordinary. the sentiment is heavy and thick, but kimberly stern's performance burrows through it to deliver moving moments (1:40). clurman theater at theater row, 410 west 42nd street, clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (ginia bellafante)  'big apple circus' one terrific show (2:15). damrosch park, lincoln center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100; closing on sunday. (van gelder)  'martin short: fame becomes me' this eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest mr. short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. with serviceably tuneful songs by scott wittman and marc shaiman (of ''hairspray'' fame) (1:45). jacobs theater, 242 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200; closing on sunday. (brantley)  'strings' keir dullea stars in carole bugg√©'s intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful ''copenhagen''-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th street theater lab, 236 west 78th street, (212) 362-0329; closing tomorrow. (gates)  'true west' this perfectly pleasant new version of sam shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). big little theater, 141 ridge street, near houston street, lower east side, (212) 868-4444; closes tonight. (zinoman)  movies  ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have english subtitles. full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.  'apocalypto' (r, 138 minutes, in maya) more blood from mel gibson, but more ''braveheart'' than ''passion of the christ.'' ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (a. o. scott)  'babel' (r, 143 minutes, in english, spanish, japanese, berber, arabic and sign language) this hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. the themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. written by guillermo arriaga and directed by alejandro gonzalez i√±√°rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. almost. (scott)  'black christmas' (r, 100 minutes) it's been more than 30 years since the original ''black christmas'' revealed how much fun it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. glen morgan's disastrous remake not only sidelines the original's hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. smothering terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, the movie is no more than a dismal christmas card to its predecessor. (jeannette catsoulis)  'blood diamond' (r, 138 minutes) the makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in africa, starring an excellent leonardo dicaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (manohla dargis)  'bobby' (r, 111 minutes) emilio estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. the day in question ended with the assassination of robert f. kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. a huge cast (including anthony hopkins, sharon stone, demi moore, ashton kutcher, lindsay lohan and mr. estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (scott)  * 'borat: cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan' (r, 89 minutes) in this brainy, merciless comedy, a kazakh journalist named borat sagdiyev, a k a the british comic sacha baron cohen, invades america. america laughs, cries, surrenders. (dargis)  'casino royale' (pg-13, 144 minutes) the latest james bond vehicle finds the british spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named daniel craig. zap, pow, ka-ching! (dargis)  'charlotte's web' (g, 113 minutes) gary winick's adaptation of e. b. white's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. the celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and julia roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (scott)  * 'children of men' (r, 100 minutes) the end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by alfonso cuar√≥n about a nervously plausible future. based on the p. d. james book, the film stars an excellent clive owen and features equally sterling support from the actors michael caine, danny huston and chiwetel ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer emmanuel lubezki. (dargis)  'copying beethoven' (pg-13, 104 minutes) the director agnieszka holland and her star ed harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the ninth symphony. diane kruger also stars. (dargis)  'curse of the golden flower' (r, 114 minutes, in mandarin) the chinese director zhang yimou aims for shakespeare and winds up with jacqueline susann in this tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. as an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, chow yun fat and gong li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. directing with operatic delirium, mr. zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (catsoulis)  'the dead girl' (r, 93 minutes) an impressively well-acted movie, ''the dead girl'' has a chip on its shoulder. the relentless emotional violence in it, a compendium of five vignettes related to a young woman whose naked, mutilated corpse is discovered on a barren hillside, is of a level rarely found in movies, even those steeped in gore. there is some gore in ''the dead girl,'' but it is eclipsed in intensity by the verbal abuse hurled by its desperately unhappy characters at the people closest to them. (stephen holden)  'death of a president' (no rating, 93 minutes) this fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 toronto film festival, imagines what might happen if george w. bush were assassinated. condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by gabriel range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (scott)  'deck the halls' (pg, 95 minutes) in the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which matthew broderick and danny devito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (scott)  'd√âj√Ä vu' (pg-13, 125 minutes) in tony scott's preposterous action flick, with denzel washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (dargis)  * 'the departed' (r, 150 minutes) martin scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. based on the crackling hong kong thriller ''infernal affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from matt damon and leonardo dicaprio, and a showboating jack nicholson. (dargis)  'dhoom 2' (no rating, 151 minutes, in hindi) a slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. hrithik roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and aishwarya rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (rachel saltz)  'eragon' (pg, 99 minutes) this lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest british actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as tim allen's manager. directed by the wonderfully named stefen fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (john malkovich), a whey-faced hero (edward speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (sienna guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. in all likelihood, neither will the audience. (catsoulis)  * '51 birch street' (no rating, 88 minutes) the mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, doug block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (scott)  * 'flags of our fathers' (r, 132 minutes) clint eastwood raises the flag over iwo jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. the fine cast includes ryan phillippe, jesse bradford and adam beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (dargis)  'flannel pajamas' (no rating, 124 minutes) the twin specters of ingmar bergman and woody allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''scenes from a mixed marriage'' or ''annie hall without laughs.'' this smart, talky history of a relationship between two new yorkers follows a jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a roman catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (holden)  * 'flushed away' (pg, 85 minutes) sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical british anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from aardman animations (''wallace and gromit,'' ''chicken run'') is completely delightful. (scott)  'for your consideration' (pg-13, 86 minutes) this satire of pre-oscar-nomination buzz in hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy christopher guest and his improvisatory company have made. it is also the flimsiest, and unlike mr. guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. as farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of catherine o'hara. (holden)  'the good shepherd' (r, 157 minutes) this chilly film written by eric roth and directed by robert de niro about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the central intelligence agency, namely that of matt damon. (dargis)  'the good german' (r, 102 minutes) in his adaptation of the joseph kanon novel, steven soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. it's no wonder george clooney, who stars alongside a vamping cate blanchett, looks confused. (dargis)  'happy feet' (pg, 100 minutes) the director george miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. take hankies. (dargis)  'the history boys' (r, 104 minutes) the current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of alan bennett's tony award-winning play, set in a north england boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. as two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to oxford and cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. how to teach and interpret history is the question. (holden)  'i love you (volim te)' (no rating, 83 minutes, in croatian) in this bleak drama about a young advertising hotshot who learns that he's h.i.v.-positive, the croatian writer and director dalibor matanic conjures a disaffected, post-communist lifestyle of casual hedonism and emotional bankruptcy. the premise may be trite -- personal growth through unexpected adversity -- but in its pervasive atmosphere of haunting sterility, the movie is as much about the loss of a generation as the redemption of an individual. (catsoulis)  * 'inland empire' (no rating, 179 minutes) david lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling laura dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. as cracked as mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (dargis)  'the last king of scotland' (r, 121 minutes) kevin macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the ugandan dictator idi amin from inside the palace walls. forest whitaker plays the mad king, while james mcavoy plays the fool. (dargis)  * 'letters from iwo jima' (r, 141 minutes, in japanese) another masterwork from clint eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. ken watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of iwo jima. (scott)  * 'little children' (r, 130 minutes) todd field's adaptation of tom perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. kate winslet and patrick wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''madame bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (scott)  'man of the year' (pg-13, 115 minutes) robin williams plays a comedian and talk show host who plunges into the presidential campaign, telling truths the timid politicians dare not utter. not really. this would-be satire, written and directed by barry levinson, is hectic and tired, with too many plots and too few sharp insights. (scott)  * 'marie antoinette' (pg-13, 123 minutes) in this elaborate, bittersweet confection, sofia coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of france (played with wit and charm by kirsten dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (scott)  'night at the museum' (pg, 108 minutes) in this chaotic, overstuffed family comedy, ben stiller is a night watchman at the american museum of natural history, where the exhibits come to life at night and attack him and one another. this computerized spectacle spares no expense, but the storytelling is weak, and the hit-or-miss jokes miss more than hit. (holden)  'notes on a scandal' (r, 92 minutes) judi dench and cate blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. adapted by patrick marber from a novel by zo√´ heller and directed by richard eyre. (dargis)  * 'pan's labyrinth' (r, 119 minutes, in spanish) guillermo del toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-civil war fascist spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. in either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (scott)  'the painted veil' (pg-13, 125 minutes) nicely directed by john curran, this version of the w. somerset maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with naomi watts and edward norton. (dargis)  'perfume: the story of a murderer' (r, 147 minutes) there's no other way to say it: tom tykwer's excruciatingly literal-minded adaptation of the best-selling novel about an 18th-century serial killer with an acute sense of smell is a real stinker. (scott)  'the pursuit of happyness' (pg-13, 117 minutes) how you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find will smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (dargis)  * 'the queen' (pg-13, 103 minutes) directed by stephen frears from a very smart script by peter morgan, and starring a magnificent helen mirren in the title role, ''the queen'' pries open a window in the house of windsor around the time of the death of diana, princess of wales, blending fact with fiction. (dargis)  'rocky balboa' (pg, 102 minutes) surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. it's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. from the very beginning, rocky balboa was about as lifelike a character as popeye pumped up with spinach. but that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (holden)  'the tiger and the snow' (no rating, 115 minutes, in arabic, english and italian) war may be hell, but for roberto benigni it's just another romantic comedy waiting to be filmed. this time that gnomic italian superstar is a poetry professor who must pose as a red cross surgeon to rescue his beloved from a baghdad hospital. but this contrived setup is merely an excuse for mr. benigni to climb onto a camel, blunder into a minefield and confront the american military; to mr. benigni, war is simply another stage for his outlandish ego. (catsoulis)  'unaccompanied minors' (pg, 89 minutes) the title doubles as an advisory. your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (scott)  'venus' (r, 91 minutes) a modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great peter o'toole. (scott)  * 'volver' (r, 121 minutes, in spanish) another keeper from pedro almod√≥var, with pen√©lope cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (scott)  'we are marshall' (pg, 128 minutes) this fact-based story of a west virginia college town recovering from the death of its entire football team in a 1970 plane crash is a stiff, manipulative dud that gets wrong everything ''friday night lights'' got right. matthew mcconaughey hams it up as the college's goofy new coach, who whips the replacement team into decent shape.

(smith)  * the met: 'louis comfort tiffany and laurelton hall -- an artist's country estate,' through may 20. laurelton hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. the gilded age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking long island sound -- and of the tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the temple-of-dendur-size daffodil terrace, in wood, marble and glass. the main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (see above.) (smith)  * morgan library & museum: 'saul steinberg: illuminations,' through march 4. saul steinberg's famous new yorker cover positioning manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. as this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''feet on chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''street war (cadavre exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the middle east and africa. the flow of his work amazes. 225 madison avenue, at 36th street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (grace glueck)  * museum of arts & design: 'simply droog: 10 + 3 years of creating discussion and innovation,' through jan. 14. droog design, a many-headed, loosely affiliated collective of usually, but not entirely, dutch designers and architects has probably generated more discussion than innovation in its 13 years of existence. presented in a free-flowing, droog-designed layout, this show vigorously continues the process. it includes about 150 mostly domestic objects by scores of designers. some are great, some are silly, some are conceptual art. but there is plenty to sink your teeth into, especially with help from the small free brochure containing label information and rationales for each item. 40 west 53rd street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org. (smith)  * museum of the city of new york: 'a city on paper: saul steinberg's new york,' through march 25. a very lively adjunct to the morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on new york. an architect, steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the chrysler building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. new york people, in steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. you may think you know steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 fifth avenue at 103rd street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (glueck)  onassis cultural center: 'athens-sparta,' through may 12. painted vases, pottery, sculptured steles, tiny carved figures, writings inscribed on stone and a selection of coins are among the nearly 300 objects in this show, whose first section begins with objects from both cities during the geometric period (1050-700 b.c.) two other sections deal with the on-again, off-again relationship between the cities in the fifth century b.c. as society evolved from tribal to civil and felt the first stirrings of democracy during the archaic period (650-480 b.c.), rigid geometrical motifs were succeeded by more human forms, like the kouroi and korai, the stone or bronze statues, sometimes life-size, representing young men and women and symbolizing a new emphasis on the individual. on view from the sixth century b.c. are two small attic representations of kourai, dressed statues of maidens, said to represent the athenian aristocracy in rites celebrating the goddess athena. carved in stone, with long, braided hair (one is headless, but her braids are visible) and beautifully articulated drapery that clings to their bodies, they disappeared as a type after the persian wars. 645 fifth avenue, near 52nd street, (212) 486-4448. (glueck)  * p.s. 1 contemporary art center: 'defamation of character,'  through jan. 15. with 46 artists and a mix of usual and unusual suspects, this exhibition forms a black hole in which dada, fluxus, punk, pop, conceptual and neo-conceptual mingle like cackling furies along with performance art, feminism, abject art and various forms of appropriation. while its dour tone becomes a bit relentless, it is admirably consistent and shows artists grappling with reality, which has its own kind of comfort. 22-25 jackson avenue, at 46th avenue, long island city, queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (smith)  p.s. 1 contemporary art center: 'the gold standard,' through jan 15. gold is both color and subject in this glittering, pertinent show, installed on creamy yellow walls. even though a generally dim view of contemporary society prevails, it is scary how good gold makes everything look. (see above.) (smith)  whitney museum of american art: 'kiki smith: a gathering, 1980-2005,' through feb. 11. many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. and some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. the whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. but fanciful as it is, ms. smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. it wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. it is about life and death, the essential things. 945 madison avenue, at 75th street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (holland cotter)  last chance  american folk art museum: 'a deaf artist in early america: the worlds of john brewster jr.,' few early american artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than john brewster jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the american folk art museum. and few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: mr. brewster was born deaf in an era before remedial help or a common sign language existed. the case the show makes that mr. brewster's disability is reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 west 53rd street, manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org; closes on sunday. (cotter)  brooklyn museum: 'looking back from ground zero: images from the brooklyn museum collection'  this show presents a historical picture of lower manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the world trade center as the pivotal point. a short film, ''building the world trade center,'' produced by the port authority of new york and new jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. a small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 eastern parkway, at prospect park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes on sunday. ( cotter)  * frick collection: 'domenico tiepolo (1727-1804): a new testament' the 60 ink drawings by domenico tiepolo, son of the italian master painter giambattista, have a funny kind of jitter. they look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. illustrations of episodes from the four gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. in them the christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious but with notes of homely sweetness: jesus in gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the virgin mary's mother, anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses who guide her every step. 1 east 70th street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; closes on sunday. (cotter)  international center of photography: 'ecotopia: the second i.c.p. triennial of photography and video' punctuated by big, black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of al gore's ''inconvenient truth.'' the work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered. along the way, some of the current uses for, and technical developments in, photography and video are surveyed, adding to the impression that the i.c.p.'s focus on camera-related media, coupled with its curators' determination to be purposefully topical, sidesteps many of the pitfalls of the biennial-triennial genre. international center of photography, 1133 avenue of the americas, at 43rd street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org; closes on sunday. (smith)  morgan library & museum: 'fragonard and the french tradition' and 'mozart at 250: a celebration' memorializing mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the french painter jean-honor√© fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. the fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them fran√ßois boucher, hubert robert and jean-baptiste greuze and jacques-louis david; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the morgan's collection. the show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. although the works in the mozart display -- letters and musical scores, like the autograph manuscript of the ''haffner'' symphony performed at mozart's first public concert in vienna in 1783 -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the fragonard group. 255 madison avenue, at 36th street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; closes on sunday. (glueck)  * new-york historical society: 'legacies: contemporary artists reflect on slavery' slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the united states until the civil rights legislation of the '60s, a full century after the emancipation proclamation. or the ''emancipation approximation,'' as the artist kara walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. they are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 2 west 77th street, manhattan, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org; closes on sunday. (cotter)  * a. l. steiner: 1 million photos, 1 euro each (minimum order) and unborrowed from the eye: luke dowd, scott myles, david noonan, brett cody rogers and giles round contrasts happen. in the outer gallery five young men explore what might be called neo-constructivist quasi-painting with a kind of desperate, post-punk glower. in the inner gallery a. l. steiner's raunchy, out-there photographs show almost nothing but women having a blast being women. they avoid the all-too-usual connotations of exploitation and sensationalism that plague intimate, often sexual photographs, which is no mean achievement, politically or aesthetically. john connelly presents, 625 west 27th street, chelsea, (212) 337-9563, johnconnellypresents.com; closes tomorrow. (smith)  * cheyney thompson: 'quelques aspects de l'art bourgeois: la non-intervention' a teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery's storage shelves. the title translates as ''certain aspects of bourgeois art: non-intervention.'' andrew kreps, 525 west 22nd street, chelsea, (212) 741-8849; closes tomorrow. (smith)  * atelier van lieshout: slavecity in this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose ''participants'' each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. the tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the ''midi disciplinator,'' a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. tanya bonakdar gallery, 521 west 21st street, chelsea, (212) 414-4144; closes tomorrow. (smith)  * 'when the revolution comes' the artist michael st. john has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. it's great to revisit nancy grossman's leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and holt quentel's distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. strong young artists like nate lowman, joshua weintraub and josh white sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures look good. also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by josedgardo granados that bring pre-columbian and post-columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. kathleen cullen fine arts, 508 west 26th street, suite 5a, chelsea, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com; closes tomorrow. (cotter)  * the whitney museum of american art: mark grotjahn mining the early modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this los-angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. in some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shieldlike frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 madison avenue, at 75th street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes on sunday. (smith)  correction:  january 12, 2007, friday  a dance entry in the listings pages of weekend last friday about complexions contemporary ballet, which is at the joyce theater this week, misstated the date its engagement ends. it is sunday; it did not end yesterday.  the entry also misidentified the choreographer whose work is set to the music of marvin gaye. he is dwight rhoden -- not desmond richardson, who is a choreographer and dancer who runs the company with mr. rhoden. and the entry included an outdated reference to a new work by nicolo fonte. the program was changed and does not include that work.

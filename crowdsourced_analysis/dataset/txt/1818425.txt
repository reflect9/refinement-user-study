'deaniacs' did just fine   to the editor:  robert hicks made some excellent points in ''an election with no losers'' (op-ed, jan. 7). but why did he find it necessary, as so many do, to take a swipe at former gov. howard dean, the chairman of the democratic national committee? what is the ''reflexive deaniac liberalism'' that he claims has run the party amok?  if it brought the party its successful 50-state strategy, refocused this nation on the unsuccessful iraq war, and revitalized the grass-roots supporters who helped carry the democratic party to an overwhelming victory in november, then i believe that this ''reflexive deaniac liberalism'' is working quite well.  nancy walker koppelman  santa barbara, calif., jan. 8, 2007

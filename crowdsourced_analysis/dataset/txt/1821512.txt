how transfer taxes work   the good news for new york city's budget stems partly from the taxes new yorkers must pay when buying property in the city's booming real estate market. the city, along with the state, is collecting a record amount in transfer taxes from the sale of residential properties, and those sales have remained strong.  the city collects a transfer tax of 1 percent of the sales price up to $500,000, and 1.425 percent of the price above that amount. for a $1.5 million home -- not an uncommon purchase in new york these days -- that totals $19,250.  in addition, new york state collects a tax of 0.4 percent on the sales price, or an additional $6,000 on a $1.5 million home.  then there's the ''mansion tax,'' a tax imposed by new york state on home sales of $1 million or more, which would now include a fair share of new york property transactions. that 1 percent tax yields the state $15,000 on a $1.5 million transaction.  in addition, there is a mortgage tax, which varies by location in new york state, but is typically in the range of 2 percent. for a $1.5 million home, a $1.2 million mortgage would yield roughly $24,000, although buyers of co-ops typically do not face this tax.  all told, that $1.5 million purchase could yield $64,250 in taxes for the city and state.  gerry mullany

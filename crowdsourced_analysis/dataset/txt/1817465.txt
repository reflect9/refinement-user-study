more zest from cayenne   introduced on monday: 2008 porsche cayenne and cayenne turbo  is it real? so real that even as the wraps were being taken off the new s.u.v.'s in detroit, production had already begun in leipzig, germany.  what's the point? when the venerable sports car maker brought out the cayenne in 2002, porsche purists were horrified -- like a trashy in-law had joined the family. over the years, this upstart has not only gained acceptance, it became porsche's biggest seller in north america. sales have slipped enough, though, that a fresh dose of zest was needed.  what they said: ''the cayenne features a new line of direct-injection engines, which are a first for porsche; they offer a dynamic combination of both increased power and increased fuel economy,'' said dr. wendelin wiedeking, president of porsche.  what they didn't say: does everyone who ever wanted a cayenne already have one? that's the question. if they do, will more sass from the engine compartment be enough to coax current owners to buy another?  what makes it tick? bigger, yet less thirsty engines: the base v-6 grows to 3.6 liters and 290 horsepower. the v-8s increase to 4.8 liters, 385 horses for the naturally aspirated one and 500 for the turbo v-8. was that a shelby mustang we just dusted?  how much, how soon? expected in showrooms in march as 2008 models. the v-6 model will start at $43,400, with the v-8 s and turbo going for $57,900 and $93,700, respectively.  how's it look? the aggressive new front end styling makes it even more garish than it was; disturbingly compelling, in a leopard-skin jumpsuit kind of way.

and no more catalogs!   to the editor:  re ''don't call. don't write. let me be'' (your money, jan. 20):  since early december 2006, i have received 136 different catalogs in the mail. i have called each company and asked it to take my name off the mailing list and discontinue sending me catalogs.  in almost 100 percent of my calls, the person who answered has said courteously that the company would take my name off its mailing list.  let's see what actually happens i am now looking at 47 unwanted solicitations and am replying with a note asking them to discontinue their mailings.  the most satisfying aspect of this is sending back my request in their postage-paid envelopes.  charles tidd  newtown, conn., jan. 20, 2007

always time for her baby   to the editor:  i would appreciate it if people disregarded the statement in the article ''follow the money all the way to the kitchen'' (jan. 24) that i am almost never at my restaurant michy's. we created michy's with our own hands; it's our first baby and our livelihood. the thought of my not spending time in our restaurant is impossible to conceive. it is what i love most: the heat, the creativity and the insanity.  michelle bernstein  miami  the writer is the chef and a partner in michy's.

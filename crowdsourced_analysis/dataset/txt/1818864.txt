single payer's potential   to the editor:  in ''health care problem? check the american psyche'' (economic view, dec. 31), anna bernasek said that most americans don't believe that an effective single-payer health care system is possible.  i think that most americans have encountered some aspect of the modern medical culture -- where everything can be based on price, and where patients are marketing targets -- and they don't like it.  let a new single-payer proposal be put forth and debated. i believe that people will support such a program and that it will surely be an improvement over the chaotic system we have today.  margaret eiszner  kalamazoo, mich., jan. 3

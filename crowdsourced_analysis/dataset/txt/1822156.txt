bombing kills 14 pakistanis, mostly police   at least 14 people were killed, most of them policemen, and several others were wounded saturday in what appeared to be a suicide bombing here shortly before a shiite religious procession was to come through, the police said.  the police said the incident occurred in the old part of peshawar, the capital of north-west frontier province, late in the evening, as police and city workers were clearing a narrow street near a shiite mosque to make way for the procession. among the dead were the city police chief, malik muhammad saad, and several government representatives from the neighborhood, the police said.  the police said they believed the attack was by a lone suicide bomber who detonated his explosives after being stopped by a police cordon at the mouth of the street. the remains of a person the police thought was the bomber had been sent for forensic analysis, and the search for more evidence continued, said ghulam muhammad, a police official in the city.  the edhi foundation, a charity group that runs ambulance services, said it had taken at least 14 bodies to a local hospital, where people had thronged to give blood donations for the wounded.  the explosion also damaged the local power network, plunging the entire area into darkness as police and local volunteers searched for the dead and wounded.  security in peshawar was already on alert after a suicide bombing outside a marriott hotel in islamabad on friday and in preparation for ashura, one of shiite islam's holiest days.  but the leader of the province's religious government, akram khan durrani, told reporters that precautions would be further increased.  still, the police said there was little any one could do to head off a determined suicide bomber.  ''how do you know who is the suicide bomber among a multitude of people?'' a policeman said at the scene.

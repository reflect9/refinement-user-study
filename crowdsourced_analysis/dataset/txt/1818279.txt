film in review; stomp the yard   opens today nationwide  directed by sylvain white  109 minutes  brotherhood is powerful. that's the message of ''stomp the yard,'' a strange and at times strangely compelling mix of black fraternity recruitment video and inspirational tale about a hip-hop boy in a stepping world.  after a dance-off ends with a fight and murder, dj leaves los angeles and krumping for atlanta and stepping. at truth university (go, truth!), the all-black school where he enrolls, stepping -- that combination of precision dancing, marching and chanting done in african-american fraternities and sororities -- rules, and gammas and thetas are the sharks and jets.  dj (the engaging columbus short) stands out: he's a work-study student among the haute bourgeoisie and a street-style dancer among steppers (though it can be difficult to differentiate styles in the frenetically edited dance sequences). ''stomp the yard'' means to be a fable about finding your place in the group (a primal college story, after all) and succeeds most when it hews closest to genre formulas, showing a milieu rarely glimpsed on film, and least when it too warmly embraces fraternity culture.  here, frat affiliation is lifelong and a predictor of success, with a pedigree so echt it includes the rev. dr. martin luther king jr. but race and social justice are incidental to the gammas and thetas and to ''stomp,'' which posits a world in which white people exist only to fill seats in upscale restaurants. dj doesn't need to change the world, he just needs to find a way to dance in it.  rachel saltz  ''stomp the yard'' is rated pg-13 (parents strongly cautioned). there is a little violence, a little sex and a lot of stepping.

green, not greenwashed   to the editor:  kim severson accuses nature's path's envirokidz cereal of ''greenwashing.'' for more than 22 years, nature's path has produced certified organic breakfast and snack foods. arran stephens, our founder and president, was born and raised on one of the very early sustainable organic farms, and has been involved in changing the way food is grown and processed long before there was an ''organic industry.''  giving 1 percent of envirokidz sales to help protect endangered environments and species is something we all feel good about. what does this have to do with ''greenwashing?'' we are ''green'' (environmentally committed) from the inside out!  maria emmer-aanes  blaine, wash.  the writer is the director of marketing for nature's path foods.

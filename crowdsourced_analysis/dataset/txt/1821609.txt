dining, exploring: ain't queens grand?   follow william grimes to his home of 27 years, astoria -- ''the gateway to queens,'' and consequently, to korean grilled jellyfish, polish smoked ham, greek pastries, mexican fruit tarts and a plethora of international markets. ''my culinary life has been transformed by the gold city supermarket,'' he says. the produce and meat departments are mind-boggling, the condiments dazzling, and ''the fish counter is dramatic,'' he says. ''i once saw an eel make a break for freedom, slithering across the produce-department floor.'' all this and ''the constant possibility of erasure'' -- a ''witty and elegiac'' group show, says holland cotter, ''exploring transience as an existential reality and as a conceptual ploy in late-20th-century art'' -- is surely worth a trip on the 7 train.  gold city supermarket, 46-31 kissena boulevard, flushing, (718) 762-7688.

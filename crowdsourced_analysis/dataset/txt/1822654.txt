corrections   an article on jan. 12 about the awarding of the medal of honor to cpl. jason l. dunham of scio, n.y., referred incorrectly to his military service. corporal dunham, who was killed in iraq after throwing himself on a grenade to protect two men in his unit, was a marine, not a soldier. he is the first marine and the second service member -- not the second soldier -- to receive the medal of honor for service in the war in iraq. the article also misstated the number of medals that have been awarded since world war ii and misstated the timing of restrictions that tightened the criteria for the medal. there have been 380 medals awarded since then, not ''slightly more than 840.'' the requirements were tightened during the war, not after it.

the athlete is to blame, too   to the sports editor:  re ''tennessee says top defender is no longer enrolled,'' jan. 14: the academic failures that led to demetrice morley's dismissal from the university of tennessee football team have many causes. while the university should shoulder blame for turning a blind eye to morley's questionable high school record, morley himself is equally accountable.  morley's athletic gifts afforded him a rare second chance at academic success. instead of learning from his mistakes in high school, he chose to repeat them at the collegiate level.  while tennessee's motives for affording the opportunity are debatable, the end result is that the university gave morley the chance to succeed both on the field and in the classroom.  the system may have failed morley, but morley also failed himself.  ryan lieberman  atlanta

it's a still camera. no, a camcorder. no need to choose because it's both.   many digital cameras shoot rudimentary video, and some camcorders take a shot at producing passable photographs. the canon dc50 tries to do both well. its five-megapixel sensor is equal in resolution to that of some midgrade cameras, and is actually bigger than those used by some photojournalists just a year or so ago.  canon's road map for the future of imaging foresees a merging of video and still photography, with one sensor and one chipset to satisfy both needs, and the dc50 is a step in that direction. a new processing chip, the digic dv ii, handles both kinds of images.  the dc50, which will be available at the end of next month for about $799, has both a built-in flash and video light. it can record still and moving images simultaneously onto three-inch dvds, including dual-layer ones for added capacity, and a minisd-size camera card.  the camera's 10x lens zooms out to a serious telephoto length, 447 millimeters in still-camera terms. an image stabilization mechanism can be turned on to prevent shaky snapshots at this high magnification.  marty katz  circuits

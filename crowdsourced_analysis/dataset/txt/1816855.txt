the common application; typo.com   joan rynearson, an education consultant in the state of washington, got a call last fall from a student who had been tooling around commonap.org for an eternity -- five minutes -- and couldn't find application directions or lists of colleges or even a log-in page. ''it wasn't the right site, and it was very misleading,'' ms. rynearson complains.  commonapp.org spelled with two ps -- is the web site of the common application, the standard form used to apply to about 300 colleges and universities.  commonap.org (with one p) is a page of generically labeled links (''my common ap,'' ''download college application,'' etc.) that lead to still more links for advertisers -- essay-writing services, college-search consultants, travel providers and the like.  commonap.org is one of more than two million sites with content provided by oversee.net. corinne forti, a spokeswoman, says the company does not condone misspelling web addresses in order to siphon off their traffic and does not monitor all of its sites.  still, isn't wordplay the point? companies like  oversee fill web sites with links to advertisers interested in the audience suggested by the domain name. it gets a fee each time a customer is hooked by, say, clicking on a college loan application link found on commonap.org.  christine lagorio  looking for:  ratemyprofessors.com, the teacher evaluation site  facebook.com, the social-networking site  mtvu.com, mtv's site for college students  myspace.com, the social-networking site  you might get:  rateyourprofessor.com, advertising links for online degrees, auto insurance, etc.  faceboo.com, ''your online source for romance and love,'' links to dating sites  umtv.com, links to companies selling television services  myspace.org, links to pornographic sites  blackboard

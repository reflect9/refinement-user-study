think again   to the editor:  i was amused (and disappointed but not surprised) by the comment, regarding daniel levitin's idea that music evolved in mankind as an expression of sexual or ''reproductive'' fitness. in arguing against this hypothesis, steven pinker asked, why does ''a 60-year-old woman enjoy listening to classical music when she's at home alone?'' hmm. perhaps for the same reason 60-year-old men enjoy images and thoughts of sexy young women when they're at home alone. dr. pinker may not think so, but 60-year-old women have not lost their ability to respond to sexual signals by reproductively fit young men. i'm only 51, and i hope i'll continue to enjoy music by sexy young men as long as i'm alive.  ann herendeen  brooklyn  neuroscience of music

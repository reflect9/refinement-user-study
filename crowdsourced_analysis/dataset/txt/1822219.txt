5,000 more parking spaces for metro-north stations   about 5,000 parking spaces will be added at metro-north train stations over the next few years, the state department of transportation said last week.  the department said 3,000 spaces would be for two new stations, one planned for the border of orange and west haven, which would get 2,000 spaces, and the other, a second station in fairfield, near the bridgeport line, which would get 1,000.  a new surface lot and two new decks to be built on the existing garage in bridgeport would add 500 spaces; a planned multideck garage in stratford would add 435; and another 100 would be on a deck to be built over the present lot in wilton, the department said. as many as 1,000 spaces could also be added in new haven.  eugene j. colonese, the department's rail administrator, said that the earliest that work on the new garages could begin would be this year in bridgeport.  state senator john mckinney, republican of fairfield, a member of the legislature's transportation committee, said that 5,000 spaces would not be enough. he said other lots at stations between stamford and fairfield were also overcrowded.  in westport, for example, the police said 930 people were waiting for about 1,500 reserved spaces at its saugatuck and greens farms stations. they said the wait was about four years for a town resident and about six years for nonresidents.  mr. mckinney said towns should develop plans for more parking and the state should make money available to help. ''we have $600 million committed to buying new rail cars to increase ridership on metro-north, but we're not going to be able to do that if people can't park at the train station,'' he said.  mr. colonese said the transportation department was always looking for ways to add parking. ''we realize it is a constraint on ridership,'' he said.  jeff holtz  the week

creating a new glow in antique kimono stencils   for centuries, kimonos were decorated with patterns using paper stencils called katagami, made from three layers of rice paper and treated with persimmon juice. the technique is now a dying art, but hiromi ishii, an artist in tokyo, has found a way to resurrect the one-of-a-kind stencils -- as paper lanterns.  mr. ishii takes stencils dating from the late 19th century to the 1940s, backs them with new rice paper and attaches them to iron frames wired to hold 25-watt bulbs. the katagami lights are manufactured in two shapes: rectangular and cylindrical. the rectangular lanterns come in 18-inch and 24-inch versions (the smaller, below, is $1,300), and the cylindrical ones are 18 inches high (above, $1,300). prices range from $1,300 to $1,500. tama gallery, 5 harrison street, (212) 566-7030, tamagallery.com.  elaine louie  currents: lighting

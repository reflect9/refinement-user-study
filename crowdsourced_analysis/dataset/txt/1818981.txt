libraries use sensitivity to defuse unruly teenagers   lock the library doors to keep out rowdy teenagers? not in connecticut.  unable to cope with troublesome middle schoolers, a public library in maplewood, n.j., is considering closing during after-school hours. but in connecticut, ingenuity and sensitivity have forestalled such talk.  ''we made an effort to engage them and it's helped,'' said les kozerowitz, director of the norwalk public library. faced with vandalism and unruliness several years ago, his staff members sought training to deal with adolescents. the library also hired a security guard, created a teenage advisory board and is making a space just for teenagers in the basement.  no major incidents have been noted in the past year, he said. ''we want them in the library but using the library in an appropriate way,'' mr. kozerowitz said.  not all guards are equal, however. ''finding someone with the right sense of sternness, respect for the clients and warmth is important,'' said alice knapp, director of public services for the ferguson library of stamford. at one of its three branches, a teacher from the middle school across the street works as a guard after school. ''they know they'll see him at school the next day,'' ms. knapp said. ''it's nirvana.''  to keep trouble at bay, libraries can't operate in isolation; there must be a ''community conversation'' in which agencies share information about after-school programs, said barbara blosveren, director of the stratford library association. ''they need to feel welcome,'' she said.  when all else fails, technology helps. norwalk librarians can block computer access of anyone caught misbehaving. ''that's given us a lot of control,'' said judith rivas, head reference librarian.  margaret farley steele

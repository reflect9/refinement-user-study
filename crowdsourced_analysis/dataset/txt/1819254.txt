fix the dysfunctional family court   nixzmary brown was just 7 when she died, one year ago this month in brooklyn, an apparent victim of brutality at home and neglect by the child welfare system. since then, the city has added staff, upgraded training and addressed faults in the administration for children's services. large problems still need fixing, however, and none so urgently as the city's family court, which state neglect has left in something between chaos and despair.  incredibly, the court has only 47 judges, a number determined by the state and unchanged since 1991. that is not enough for the court to oversee cases like nixzmary's as closely as it should. state legislators should increase the number of judges right away, and gov. eliot spitzer should put the family court high on his judicial reform agenda.  lawyers for the city in family court are often poorly prepared. legal aid lawyers are spread unreasonably thin. judges can handle as many as 2,500 cases a year, leaving them as little as 10 minutes on the bench for each one.  bill de blasio, a city council member from brooklyn, has called attention to the court's problems while asking hard questions about the child welfare system. he is also pressing for money that was allotted to support the system last year, about $13 million, to be made permanent. the city's public advocate, betsy gotbaum, has made the good suggestion of creating a children's public advocate.  nixzmary's death heightened awareness of child abuse and neglect and helped to increase reports to the city by more than 30 percent. it is cruel to leave these children's fates to an institution as overwhelmed as the family court.

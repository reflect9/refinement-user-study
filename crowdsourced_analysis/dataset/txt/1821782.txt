countdown to the census   the accuracy of the census is determined in the planning stages, and planning for the 2010 count is already imperiled. the dangers fall into two categories: money (too little) and politics (too much). the new congress will have to manage both vigilantly.  an underfinanced census would be an inaccurate census. easy-to-count suburbanites -- who tilt republican -- would almost certainly be overrepresented, while urban dwellers -- who lean democratic -- would get short shrift because of the difficulty in counting mobile and diverse populations. to prevent that, lawmakers must begin by reinstating the roughly $50 million that was cut from the current census budget by the previous congress.  the new congress must also ensure that the next budget includes adequate funds for projects that made the 2000 census a success. among them are strong partnerships with state and local governments, as well as with churches and businesses, to promote the census, and a multimillion-dollar down payment on the census advertising budget. because they will not bear fruit until the census is under way, those projects may seem easy to sacrifice in favor of more immediate demands. but any budget shortfalls cannot be made up later because the necessary lead time will have been squandered.  lawmakers should also hold hearings to air the reasons behind the abrupt resignation last november of the director of the census bureau and the equally sudden departure of his deputy director. both men were highly qualified statisticians and, by all accounts, committed to an unbiased and thorough census. they have acknowledged tensions with the bush administration, but offered no details.  whatever it finds, the inquiry should send a clear message that the white house must choose new census directors whose professional qualifications and impartiality are above reproach.  editorial

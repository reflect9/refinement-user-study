new blue jay lets it fly about the mets   john thomson is a journeyman pitcher with a career mark of 62-84 over a decade of service in the major leagues, including a forgettable 2-6 record with the mets during a portion of the team's very forgettable 2002 season.  on tuesday, the 33-year-old thomson agreed to a one-year, $500,000 deal with toronto. nothing startling about that. but on wednesday, in a conference call with toronto reporters, thomson made some waves, saying he had decided to pass up an offer from the mets because he did not like the catching style of paul lo duca, the mets' all-star catcher.  ''as far as just looking at paul lo duca across the field, i'm not really into how he acts behind the plate,'' said thomson, who said he preferred the catching style of toronto's gregg zaun.  thomson went on to add that he also was not particularly thrilled with the way cliff floyd played the outfield, calling him a ''little shaky.'' thomson was apparently unaware that the mets and floyd have parted ways and that floyd will not be patrolling left field in shea stadium next season.  thomson and lo duca have never been teammates. attempts to reach lo duca for comment yesterday were unsuccessful, and an attempt to reach chris arnold, thomson's agent, were to no avail, too. but perhaps lo duca's critique of thomson's pitching style, and his career earned run average of 4.69, will be forthcoming.  baseball

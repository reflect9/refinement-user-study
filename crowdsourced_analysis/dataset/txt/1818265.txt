pork, peanut butter and security   making his umpteenth pitch to congress to provide more security money for new york city, mayor michael bloomberg stated the obvious when he said that money to defend against terrorism should be divvied up based on an assessment of risks, not ''spread across the country like peanut butter.'' after all, his testimony to the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee echoed one of the key recommendations of the 9/11 commission. the mayor estimated that more than $3 billion had been distributed in this lunatic way to date.  unfortunately, the committee's incoming chairman, senator joseph lieberman, is partial to peanut butter. mr. lieberman, who won re-election last november as an independent with help from mr. bloomberg, continues to believe that every state, regardless of the risks or threats it faces, should be getting antiterrorism money. in negotiations with the house, mr. lieberman is seeking a ''compromise'' formula that preserves guaranteed minimums for relatively low-risk places like his home state of connecticut. the minimums he wants well exceed the financing favored by the house, and cannot be justified on the basis of national security.  mr. lieberman also wants to increase the overall amount of money budgeted for state and local antiterrorism efforts. he is right about that. high-risk jurisdictions like new york have been unfairly burdened by the steep decrease in spending recently. but without a formula adjustment that minimizes the pork barreling that now sends antiterrorism money needed in new york city to places like nebraska, it would also increase the waste.  mr. lieberman fought the odds, held his seat and got this chairmanship. now it's up to him to use the power responsibly.  editorial

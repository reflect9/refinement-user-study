nassau has $100 million for open space   nassau county has $100 million to spend on open space and environmental projects, and county executive thomas r. suozzi is asking how to use it.  earlier this month, mr. suozzi called for comments from the public, civic organizations, environmental groups and government officials to develop a list of projects to finance under the $100 million environmental program bond act that voters approved in november. he appointed an advisory committee to evaluate the projects. nominations begin thursday and continue until march 15.  ''the more information given, the better,'' said thomas f. maher, the director of environmental coordination for nassau county.

'a mania for hegel'   to the editor:  peter d. kramer, in his review of ''putnam camp,'' by george prochnik (dec. 24), observes that ''a mania for hegel had swept st. louis in the 1860s.'' a similar hegelian mania, it should perhaps be noted, also swept through the upper bronx and large swaths of westchester, putnam and dutchess counties, as attest the many vestigial dialektischenpfosten (''dialectical posts'') that still dot the landscape there.  jim holt  new york

state of the union: another take; a few words in defense of our country   randy newman, the singer, songwriter and composer, performed this song at carnegie hall in 2006. it will be released soon online. this is an abridged version.  i'd like to say a few words  in defense of our country  whose people aren't bad nor are they mean  now the leaders we have  while they're the worst that we've had  are hardly the worst this poor world has seen  let's turn history's pages, shall we?  take the caesars for example  why within the first few of them  they had split gaul into three parts  fed the christians to the lions  and burned down the city  and one of 'em  appointed his own horse consul of the empire  that's like vice president or something  that's not a very good example, is it?  but wait, here's one, the spanish inquisition  they put people in a terrible position  i don't even like to think about it  well, sometimes i like to think about it  just a few words in defense of our country  whose time at the top  could be coming to an end  now we don't want their love  and respect at this point is pretty much out of the question  but in times like these  we sure could use a friend  hitler. stalin.  men who need no introduction  king leopold of belgium. that's right.  everyone thinks he's so great  well he owned the congo  he tore it up too  he took the diamonds, he took the gold  he took the silver  know what he left them with?  malaria  a president once said,  ''the only thing we have to fear is fear itself''  now it seems like we're supposed to be afraid  it's patriotic in fact and color coded  and what are we supposed to be afraid of?  why, of being afraid  that's what terror means, doesn't it?  that's what it used to mean  the end of an empire is messy at best  and this empire is ending  like all the rest  like the spanish armada adrift on the sea  we're adrift in the land of the brave  and the home of the free  goodbye. goodbye. goodbye.

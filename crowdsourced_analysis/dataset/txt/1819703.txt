corrections   an article on sunday about a record set in 2006 for the amount of borrowed money the new york legislature and gov. george e. pataki committed to pet projects included an erroneous reference from david catalfamo, a spokesman for mr. pataki, to a museum that mr. catalfamo defended as a worthwhile investment. it is the natural history museum of the adirondacks in tupper lake -- not the adirondack museum, which is in blue mountain lake.

gumbel avoids chatter not related to the game   to the sports editor:  re ''gumbel's studio skills are lost in transition to nfl network booth,'' jan. 1: bryant gumbel calls the games the way serious football fans want it: the facts, and skip the personal baloney. the monday night team in particular is so annoying with all the nongame chatter, you would think it was a talk show rather than a football game. you go, bryant. i like the straightforward style that you and cris collinsworth deliver on the nfl network.  alice boltz  lancaster, pa.  to the sports editor:  i am glad not to hear an announcer blather about what is obvious to anyone watching the images of the game. whether by design or not, i prefer to hear, ''first down, giants. barber,'' then nothing as i enjoy watching the end of the play.  lawrence swiader  washington

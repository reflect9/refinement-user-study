queens is a draw for tourists   to the editor:  while we applaud the kudos bob brody gives to our most diverse borough in ''queens, for a day'' (op-ed, dec. 17), queens is hardly ''an afterthought'' in citywide tourism and marketing plans.  nyc & company has long championed queens and all it has to offer.  through events like the jamaica art and music summer festival and the hong kong dragon boat festival; cultural and educational destinations like the noguchi museum and the museum for african art; or its interesting pre-revolutionary war history and jazz heritage -- plus spectacular restaurants, promoted through our taste & tour initiative -- queens is highlighted as a travel and tourism destination regularly.  nyc & company is committed to a five-borough strategy to achieve mayor bloomberg's tourism mandate -- to attract 50 million visitors by 2015 -- by highlighting all of our boroughs as unique, vibrant and essential parts of the greatest city in the world.  tim mcguinness  executive director, nyc visit  midtown manhattan

the price of security   to the editor:  your jan. 17 editorial ''keep your shoes on, for a price'' does not address the issue of creeping elitism. some of us can choose to fly more comfortably (in first class) for more money, but we have no choice regarding airport security: we must all go through it.  if the privileged are allowed to ''buy'' better treatment by the government, where does it end? ''yes, we can dispatch a fire engine to your burning home. are you paid up for priority fire care, or are you prepared to wait for the cheaper, slower response?''  david l. meister  pacific palisades, calif.  jan. 17, 2007

in politics, friends for vintners?   since politics in albany and washington inevitably have an impact on vintners, 2007 is likely to see changes that will ultimately affect how consumers -- local, state and national -- perceive long island wines.  for starters, there is a good chance that more new york wine will be bought nationwide than ever before. that was true in 2006, producers say, though statistics are not available. they credit the federal supreme court's opening of interstate shipping in 2005 and subsequent legislation in albany that promoted shipping and assured new york's status as no. 4 in the number of wine producers, with 210, after california, washington and oregon.  east end producers have long emphasized their local identity and strengths, a practice that now seems outdated. the specialized wine media and the general news media have focused increasingly on new york as a whole, showing newfound enchantment with the finger lakes' booming industry. thus the lakes' forte -- light, crisp, food-oriented whites -- may start becoming the default new york style in buyers' minds, overshadowing long island's offerings.  the re-election of senator hillary rodham clinton in november could be seen as good news for the wine industry; in her first term, she delivered federal aid to new york agriculture and made electoral inroads in traditionally republican areas in the lakes region. james trezise, president of the new york wine and grape foundation, a trade association partly financed with state money, says his office has worked closely with senator clinton's. the foundation, in canandaigua in the finger lakes, provides financial and other support to the long island wine council, a promotional organization.  the politics of gov. eliot spitzer's budget will show whether new york wines have a new friend. only new york wines, including jamesport's cabernet franc, were served at official transition ceremonies in albany, mr. trezise said.  long island vines

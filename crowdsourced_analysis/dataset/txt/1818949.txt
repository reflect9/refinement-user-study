bill that eases development may be applied to all areas   the new jersey legislature is considering a bill that would extend the benefits of the highlands preservation legislation to cities and municipalities throughout the state.  assemblywoman linda r. greenstein, a deputy speaker and sponsor of the bill, said it would use transfer of development rights, in which developers buy credits from property owners whose land is being preserved. the developers can use the credits in other areas of the state where growth is either needed or is deemed acceptable.  the municipalities that accept the growth can charge impact fees of $15,000 per new housing unit to finance schools and utility projects.  the plan has been in effect in the highlands area, in the northern part of the state, and in areas around the pinelands for several years, but this measure would include the entire state, said ms. greenstein, a democrat from monroe.  the bill is under committee review but has already received support from gov. jon s. corzine and the state department of environmental protection, which wrote much of it.  ''the more i learn about it, the more i see it has a lot of advantages,'' ms. greenstein said. ''anything that takes development out of areas that has too much and places it where it is needed is a good idea.''  john holl  the week

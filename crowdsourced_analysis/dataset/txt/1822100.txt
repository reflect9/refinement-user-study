big news   to the american auto industry's injuries, you can add this insult from automotive news, the influential trade publication. it has buried ''the big three'' as shorthand for general motors, ford and chrysler.  with toyota now no. 3 in domestic sales, no. 2 worldwide and gaining ground on the no. 1 maker, g.m., ''when you say 'big three,' you would be universally misunderstood,'' said david sedgwick, editor of automotive news. ''we needed something to reference general motors, ford and chrysler, without implying they are the biggest.''  hence, the erstwhile ''big three'' will be referred to as ''the detroit three.'' (never mind that the chrysler group's parent, daimlerchrysler, is actually based in stuttgart, germany; its american base is in auburn hills, mich.)  so far, no automaker has complained about this semantic downsizing.  ''no one can deny what has taken place,'' mr. sedgwick said. ''there's not much point in engaging in wishful thinking.''  leslie wayne  openers: suits

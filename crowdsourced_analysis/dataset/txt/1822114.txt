spouses meet in school   to the editor:  in ''why are there so many single americans?'' (week in review, jan. 21), you report on a variety of expert explanations as to why college-educated men and women marry in greater numbers than their non-college-educated counterparts. but the analysis leaves out one salient possibility: college or graduate school as a social space.  i am in my 20s, and of my married, college-educated friends, the majority first met their spouses in college or graduate school. the social environment outside of college is simply less conducive to finding a like-minded spouse; the effects of college life should not be discounted.  l. david peters  new haven, jan. 22, 2007

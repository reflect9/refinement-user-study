reyes appears in commercial   at 8:45 a.m. yesterday, mets shortstop josé reyes sat shivering on a sidewalk in greenwich village.  next to him was twins starting pitcher johan santana, who was grilling a hamburger. it was about 20 degrees outside, and the wind chill made it seem like the low teens.  so what were reyes and santana doing there?  along with five other players -- minnesota's justin morneau, detroit's justin verlander, boston's jonathan papelbon, st. louis's david eckstein and the yankees' robinson canó -- they were filming a commercial for new baseball caps under the direction of spike lee.  the hats, manufactured by new era, are designed to absorb sweat more efficiently, and they have a new black underside to the bill intended to reduce glare. over and over, from 7 a.m. till noon, the players filmed the ad with 10-minute breaks from the cold.  ''i got an idea about how to stay warm,'' said morneau, the 2006 american league most valuable player, as he shuffled between the street and a dressing room at the back of the store. ''i could find all the white sox hats and light them on fire.''  michael s. schmidt  baseball: roundup

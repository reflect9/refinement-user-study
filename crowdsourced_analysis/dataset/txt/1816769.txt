corrections   an article last saturday about memorials in washington, d.c., that are dedicated to the history of other countries misstated the location of a statue to tomas masaryk, the first president of czechoslovakia. it is at the intersection of 22nd street, massachusetts avenue and q street -- not in front of the world bank on h street.

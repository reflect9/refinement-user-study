yanks still seek help at first   the yankees continued their attempt to trade randy johnson yesterday, talking with multiple teams about a deal. the most likely match remains johnson's former team, the arizona diamondbacks, but arizona has not been granted a 72-hour window to speak with him. johnson must approve a trade and it is not clear how the diamondbacks would afford him.  while the johnson talks have absorbed most of the yankees' attention, they have other needs. they are still interested in signing a first baseman, with travis lee emerging as an option if they cannot agree to terms with doug mientkiewicz on a one-year deal.  signing mientkiewicz is the yankees' priority because of his exceptional glove and decent left-handed bat. lee is also a left-hander and a strong defender, but he hit only .224 for tampa bay last season. he played briefly for the yankees in 2004.  mientkiewicz had back surgery last august after hitting .283 for kansas city. he has discussed a one-year deal with the yankees.  the yankees already have two right-handers at first base in andy phillips and josh phelps, with only one expected to make the team. if they want to add another right-handed first baseman, they could still turn to the free agent craig wilson, who hit .212 in 40 games for the yankees last season.  for now, the yankees do not have a roster spot for bernie williams, the longtime center fielder, and they also need a backup infielder. they would also like another left-handed reliever to complement mike myers. they have signed the left-hander ben kozlowski, a minor leaguer, but have made no formal offers to veteran left-handers on the free-agent market.  baseball

2 men are found dead in brooklyn garage where fire broke out   two men were found dead yesterday evening in a garage in brooklyn that was damaged by a fire, officials said.  the bodies of the men, who had not been identified as of late last night, were discovered after firefighters put out a fire in a one-story garage at 1695 east 21st street near kings highway in midwood, a neighborhood of well-kept two-story homes and brick buildings.  the blaze began just after 5 p.m. and was brought under control at 5:50 p.m. after 12 fire trucks and 60 firefighters responded, a fire department spokesman said.  last night, police tape was set up around the garage as police and fire investigators tried to learn the cause of the fire and how the two men died.  according to residents, the garage belonged to a medical office next door but was rarely used. it was often left unlocked or open, the neighbors said.  ismael rivera, 52, a parole officer who lives nearby, said two friendly homeless men in the area who were often seen in a park on kings highway had been using the garage for shelter in the past week.  on a few occasions, he said, the two men were seen in the garage burning debris to stay warm.  it was unclear, however, whether they were the men who were found dead after the fire. other residents said that on thursday night, firefighters put out a small blaze in the garage.  ben shalamov, 30, a dental technician, said that the two homeless men were last seen in the garage around 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon. he described one of the men as armenian, and said he had told people he had an ex-wife and two children in russia.  often the man, who looked to be in his 50s, would sit on benches in the neighborhood, smiling and reciting poetry as people walked by, mr. shalamov said.  he said that in the past few weeks, the man had been seen hobbling around on crutches.  ''it's sad,'' mr. shalamov said. ''they were harmless. they were nice guys who never bothered you.''

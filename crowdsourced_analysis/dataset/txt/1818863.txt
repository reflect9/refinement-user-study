workplace credit for 'life experience'   to the editor:  ''among your qualifications, an m.b.a at household u.'' (under new management, dec. 31) suggested for businesses what colleges and universities have been doing for a long time: giving credit for ''life experience'' to older students who have returned for degrees.  raising children and running a household is probably the most difficult job in the world. a homemaker wears many hats and the job description may encompass knowledge in finances, health, human resources, home improvement, culinary arts, gardening and so on. yes, one may have taken psychology courses, but the experience and knowledge acquired as a homemaker and mother, had me looking at team effectiveness and intuitive reactions in new ways.  in the late '50s and early '60s, jobs for educated women were limited; child care, as we know it today, did not exist. i was out of the work force for 15 years, raising four children, but kept my finger in the professional pot by doing volunteer work associated with my profession and maintaining membership in professional organizations.  i retired after a career of over 40 years, but i'm not done yet: i have been asked to work on a limited basis and am still involved as a volunteer.  miriam kagan margoshes  hastings-on-hudson, n.y., jan. 1

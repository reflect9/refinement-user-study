hard, easy or just right?   clay, 25 west 14th street, (212) 206-9200. www.insideclay.com.  day pass, $35.  jay cardiello likes to boast that n.f.l. training is one of the ''toughest classes in new york.'' it's a bold statement (not to mention a cliché), but mr. cardiello, left, who created this high-energy workout to bring football to sideliners, isn't afraid to be bold: he is a private trainer for n.f.l. players and former conditioning coach in the arena football league.  the routine varies but it's often a nonstop mélange of 100 push-ups and jumping jacks, 20 squats and lunges, a series of hydrants, and 10 minutes of drills (like ''blocking'' someone with a body bar, or kicking an invisible ball à la charlie brown). it's tough, though i have certainly survived harder full-body workouts. the sweltering 83-degree heat heightens the intensity, but this football practice is really just a variation on a boot camp with some ''hut huts!'' thrown in.  mr. cardiello may fancy himself a younger, less volatile joe paterno, but he is still prone to theatrics. at the beginning of the hour he yanks a curtain to seal off the room, so the group becomes an insulated unit. the music blasts --''we will rock you'' (surprise!) -- and for two minutes the team claps its hands and thumps its thighs. why? because ''i'm trying to bring out the beast within you,'' he explained. oh.  during the cool-down, mr. cardiello utters profundities like, ''if you can do this class, then why the heck can't you make it in life?'' then he whips open the curtain with a flourish.  abby ellin  this is another in a series of group fitness class reviews.  class is in session: n.f.l. training

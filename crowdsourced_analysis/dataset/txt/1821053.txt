serving the u.n.   to the editor:  in ''a product of the u.n. system'' (editorial, jan. 20), you try to personalize the politics of the united nations by indicating that what went wrong with the oil for food program can be traced to one man, former under secretary general benon sevan.  you suggest that he was appointed to sensitive posts because he was a ''product of a system in which who you know and where you come from count far more than merit or vision.'' you also say he had a ''decidedly mixed performance.'' i strongly disagree.  mr. sevan was appointed to highly sensitive and demanding posts -- carrying out responsibilities that had formerly been performed by two or three assistant or under secretaries general. a check of the official records of the security council and the statements of, among others, american representatives to the united nations shows that mr. sevan and his colleagues were commended for ''outstanding work'' and ''exceptional ''professionalism.''  mr. sevan and his colleagues implemented the $64 billion oil for food program in full compliance with security council mandates, and should not be held responsible for fundamental design problems and failures by member states, including the united states.  mr. sevan and his colleagues alerted the security council as soon as information on kickbacks or surcharges being paid became known, but the security council for various political reasons chose not to act. in the meantime, mr. sevan and his colleagues brought food and medicine to a devastated people and repaired vital infrastructure.  eric l. lewis  washington, jan. 21, 2007  the writer is mr. sevan's lawyer.

corrections   a front-page article on tuesday about a proposal by gov. arnold schwarzenegger to extend health care coverage to all of california's residents misstated a requirement for insurers. they would have to contribute 85 percent of premiums to health care services, not 85 percent of profits. the article also referred incorrectly to the precedent for universal coverage. california would be the fifth state, not the fourth, to try near universal coverage. (besides maine, massachusetts and vermont, hawaii has also tried.)  a picture caption with an articlewednesday about efforts by massachusetts to extend health care coverage to all residents reversed the names in some copies of two people who helped an immigrant from bangladesh sign up for insurance. feroza bashar, a translator, was at right, and goretti macedo of cambridge health alliance was at left.

the basics; true or false: lies are hard to prove   proving perjury, the central charge against i. lewis libby, whose trial began in washington last week, can be an uphill fight. to win a perjury case, a prosecutor must convince a jury not only that the defendant said something false under oath about a significant point but also that the falsehood was more than an innocent error produced by poor memory. to be perjury, the false statement has to be a knowing lie.  perjury cases are, necessarily, almost always circumstantial. at bottom, they ask jurors to make inferences about what was going on in the defendant's head when he made the disputed statements. and it takes particularly telling circumstantial evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew something to be false but said it anyway.  mr. libby, a former chief of staff to vice president dick cheney, certainly gave a grand jury accounts of conversations with three reporters that did not match the reporters' testimony. mr. libby said, for instance, that he learned the identity of an undercover c.i.a. operative, valerie wilson, from tim russert of nbc news. mr. russert has denied that, and there is evidence mr. libby had been amply briefed about ms. wilson by the time he spoke to mr. russert.  were mr. libby's statements, if false, about something important ( something material, in legal jargon)? on the one hand, prosecutors have said that his testimony frustrated a grand jury's investigation into who disclosed ms. wilson's identity. on the other, no one has been charged with the crime of leaking her name.  most important, did mr. libby lie? it is one thing to misremember a sequence of conversations or to be preoccupied by the demands of a job. it is another to consciously decide to say something false. in the end, the case may rise or fall on whether the jury can be convinced of what only mr. libby can know for sure.  adam liptak

souvenirs of russia   to the editor: regarding ''holiday on ice: with a shot of vodka on the side'' by steve dougherty (dec. 31): i am a 60-something female, and last december i traveled on my own to moscow and st. petersburg.  i'd like to mention more wonderful things about st. petersburg. the puppet fairy tale theater puts on a magical series of plays for children based on classic nursery tales. also, a trip to the post office yielded some of the most amazing souvenirs of my trip. there, i bought embossed stamps of the zodiac, which now hang over my computer.  ruth kramer ziony  los feliz, calif.

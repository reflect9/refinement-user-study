a thinkpad tablet tries to finds its place in the sun   tablet pcs have not gained much traction in the marketplace, but lenovo's latest may rev up the genre. the x60 thinkpad tablet has a 12-inch screen that flips around to fold flat, and it is brighter than usual, with a polarizing filter to cut glare -- perhaps for those who would walk in the sun while web surfing. there is a stylus for writing on the touch screen, and its other end has an electronic eraser for quick deletions.  the x60 is now shipping with windows xp but can be upgraded to vista when it arrives at the end of the month. prices start at $1,749 for a 3.8-pound model and go as high as $4,500 for the works, including an all-day eight-cell battery, which fattens it to 4.23 pounds. an expansion base with a cd-dvd drive comes with the tablet.  the x60 communicates over all the current modes of wi-fi through an array of six antennas planted around the edges of the screen, catching a signal whatever way the tablet is held. when wi-fi isn't available, an optional cellular data modem can get you online if you sign up for an account.  marty katz  circuits

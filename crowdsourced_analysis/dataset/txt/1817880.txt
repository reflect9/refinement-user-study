world business briefing | global trade: emissions plan for airlines opposed by u.s. diplomat   a united states diplomat warned the european commission against adopting rules that would impose emission controls on all flights landing at european airports, a signal that washington may take legal action if the measure became law. the diplomat, john r. byerly, left, deputy assistant secretary of state for transportation affairs, called the proposal ''unworkable and unlawful.'' the plan would force foreign airlines flying in europe to pay for carbon dioxide emissions. under the proposal, airlines would have to meet emissions targets starting jan. 1, 2011, for all flights landing within the 27-member european union. mr. byerly's comments came on the eve of two days of formal talks with european officials aimed at concluding an ''open skies'' treaty to open up the trans-atlantic aviation market.  nicola clark

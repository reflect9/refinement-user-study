''i thought i was writing the 'secret' ellington,'' mr. harman said in 1991, ''and he had no such idea. he wanted to write a book that was a print version of the public duke ellington.''  mr. harman was born in brooklyn on june 14, 1918, and began his musical studies as a clarinetist, at the age of 9. he studied composition with roger sessions at princeton university, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1940.  in world war ii, he joined the army air force, becoming a helicopter pilot. in 1944, he was the first to accomplish a rescue by helicopter behind enemy lines, extracting three allied soldiers from a jungle in burma; an account appears in ''chopper'' by robert f. dorr (berkley, 2005). mr. harman was awarded the distinguished flying cross.  after the war, mr. harman resumed his musical studies at columbia university, where he was a student of otto luening. he completed his master's degree in 1949, and began composing, at mr. luening's advice, with a group of simple children's songs that were recorded by mary martin; the record was titled ''mary martin sings for children.'' but he wrote on a larger scale too: his catalog includes a ballet (''blackface,'' from 1947) and an opera (''the food of love,'' 1949-51) and several orchestral works. he began to compose electronic music in 1954 and took it up again 20 years later, in ''alex and the singing synthesizer.''  in the mid-1960s, mr. harman became a record producer, with a special interest in contemporary music. in 1967, he became executive vice president of cri records, which specialized in works by american composers. he was the label's executive director from 1976 to 1984.  mr. harman's wife died in 1989. in addition to his daughter, who lives in manhattan, mr. harman is survived by three sons, bruce, of santa cruz, calif.; scott, of hamilton township, n.j.; and alex, of jersey city; and three grandchildren.  correction:  february 5, 2007, monday  an obituary on wednesday about carter harman, a composer, music critic, author and record producer, misstated the name of the branch of the army in which he served in world war ii. it was the army air forces, not the army air force.

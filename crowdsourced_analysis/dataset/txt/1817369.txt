detroit rethinks sneak peeks of its cars   it's a time-honored detroit tradition. each year, in the weeks before detroit automakers parade their hottest new designs in front of thousands of journalists at the auto show, carefully selected groups of reporters assemble for sneak previews.  general motors, ford motor and the chrysler group show these journalists what they will be introducing at the auto show with the understanding that the images will not be published online, in print or on the airwaves until they say so.  this year, however, the car companies have found it more difficult than ever to keep a lid on their closely guarded designs, forcing them to rethink how they disseminate early information.  magazines like car and driver publish their february issues, the month they usually devote to auto show coverage, in december. typically, the auto companies will cooperate with car magazines as they prepare their february issues, operating under the assumption that the magazines won't hit newsstands until january.  many bloggers saw the magazines' action as a green light to break the january embargoes. ''it's fair game once the embargo's broken,'' said ray wert, associate detroit editor for jalopnik.com, a car blog owned by gawker media, whose site has posted embargoed pictures of vehicles from g.m., chrysler and ford after other publications have broken the embargoes. ''we won't be the first person to break an embargo, but we won't be third.''  rick deneau, a chrysler spokesman, said one possibility for detroit is to become more tight-fisted with the information. the japanese automakers do this now, and it is rare for companies like honda or toyota to release anything before an auto show other than a sketch of a concept car.  ''do we get away from this process?'' he said, referring to providing embargoed pictures. ''do we change the timing of when these thing can go out?''

a law school graduates from junior high   after being housed for 20 years in an old junior high school building in huntington, the touro law center has relocated to a 180,000-square-foot campus in central islip. classes began on tuesday for the 750 law students in a new building, adjacent to the alfonse m. d'amato united states courthouse and the john p. cohalan jr. court complex.  lawrence raful, the dean of the touro law center, said the school's move to central islip is part of the village's master plan to redevelop the area.  ''the area is booming and bringing new life to central islip,'' he said. ''with federal and state courthouses as our new neighbors, we form a triangle of three important and complementary legal institutions.''  the four-story law school building, which cost $35 million and is on property touro bought 10 years ago, includes two trial classrooms, a moot courtroom/auditorium that seats 500, a four-story library and a public advocacy wing that provides space for 14 nonprofit advocacy groups. the law school anticipates reaching agreements with groups that work, for example, on immigration, environmental and housing issues; they would get free rent in return for working with the college's students.  ''these groups will have access to touro's law students, who in turn will receive hands-on training,'' said mr. raful, who called the advocacy program unique among law schools in the country.  the law school's new curriculum, approved by the faculty last year, is a court participation program. first-year students will see cases moving through the courts, and third-year students will try mock cases in real courtrooms before actual judges, mr. raful said. ''other law schools have clinics,'' he said, ''but nothing like this, which is more like a medical school model.''  the touro law center was established in 1980 as part of touro college. after spending its first few years in manhattan, the law school moved to long island.  noticed

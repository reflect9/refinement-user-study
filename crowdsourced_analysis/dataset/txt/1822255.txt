up front   the only really bold thing i've ever done,'' thomas mallon insisted in a recent telephone conversation, ''was to give up tenure at vassar and start trying, in my mid-30s, to live the kind of life i might have had in my 20s.'' although his aim was to be a novelist (his first, ''arts and sciences,'' was published in 1988; his seventh, ''fellow travelers,'' is due in may), it was literary journalism, not novel-writing, that set him free from the constraints of academic prose. mallon's informed but accessible style, evident in his cover review of claire tomalin's biography of thomas hardy, has been a feature of his contributions to the book review, the new yorker, the atlantic monthly and other publications for the past 20 years -- and in ''doubting thomas,'' the column he wrote for gq magazine through much of the 1990s.  after a two-year stint with the national endowment for the humanities, mallon has happily returned to civilian life in washington, a city where a writer who isn't a political journalist, he explained, is viewed as ''slightly exotic.'' even there he has found distinctly personal ways to make literature pay. when he first moved to washington, he fixed his sights on an old house in foggy bottom, the neighborhood where his historical novel ''two moons'' is set. the owner, who had lovingly restored the place, was considering competing bids. ''send her your book,'' urged mallon's real estate agent, and that was that. he got the house, and the house got him: some crucial scenes of his new novel occur in the rooms he now calls home.  the editors

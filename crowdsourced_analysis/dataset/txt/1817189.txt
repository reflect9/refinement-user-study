new jersey death penalty   to the editor:  re ''panel seeks end to death penalty for new jersey'' (front page, jan. 3):  i have always opposed the death penalty because its existence means that innocent people will sometimes be executed, a punishment that is irreversible.  but capital punishment also sends the wrong message -- that it is acceptable for the state to kill people, but not for individual citizens to do the same.  it is not an accident that most civilized nations have rejected the death penalty. and i applaud my state for taking the first step toward repealing this barbaric law.  timothy bal  belle mead, n.j., jan. 3, 2007

seeing results in darfur   to the editor:  re ''car washes and genocide,'' by nicholas d. kristof (column, jan. 16):  in his observation that everyday citizen activism on darfur has affected the government of sudan, mr. kristof gets it right again.  as a member of amnesty international usa who holds a volunteer leadership position, i give talks and interviews on the conflict in darfur, and i am regularly asked if any of the activism has made a difference. i unequivocally respond that without citizen activism, we would not be where we are today.  yes, the progress is painfully slow and incremental, but without the voice and energy of ordinary americans, khartoum today would not be considering an african union-united nations force in darfur.  our sustained calls, letters and demonstrations have compelled our leaders to act on this issue, and have sent a clear message to khartoum that it will not be able to continue its campaign of terror and killing in darfur.  denise bell  new york, jan. 17, 2007

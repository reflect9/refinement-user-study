world briefing | united nations: new chief looks to u.s. for peacekeeping support   ban ki-moon, the new secretary general, asked president bush and members of congress during a two-day trip to washington to lift a cap on spending for peacekeeping that limits the united states' contribution to 25 percent of the total cost, which he said produced an annual shortfall of $200 million. the united states is the biggest contributor to peacekeeping and used to pay 27 percent, but congress imposed the 25 percent cap in 2005 in response to instances of sexual abuses by peacekeepers. mr. ban said he had stressed that ''while there was a time when the relationship between the united nations and the united states was not easy, it is time now to look for better days.''  warren hoge

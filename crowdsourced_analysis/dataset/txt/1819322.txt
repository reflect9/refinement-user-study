metro briefing | new york: east hampton: more dolphins discovered   rescuers discovered two more dolphins in the waters off long island yesterday, swimming in noyack creek near the eastern entrance to peconic bay. they were spotted 10 miles west of the northwest harbor cove, where rescuers have been monitoring a school of about 30 common dolphins that have grown increasingly sluggish and distressed in recent days, according to chuck hamilton, a regional supervisor for the state's department of environmental conservation. four of those dolphins died over the weekend, possibly of starvation. it was not clear yesterday if the dolphins in noyack creek had adequate food. bad weather yesterday stalled efforts to drive the northwest harbor dolphins back into deeper waters, where they have a better chance of surviving.  nicole cotroneo

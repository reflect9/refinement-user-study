arts, briefly; shakespeare in the park   those crazy veronese lovebirds have scheduled a date in central park this summer. ''romeo and juliet,'' shakespeare's tale of woe and badly mixed signals, will be the first presentation in the public theater's 2007 shakespeare in the park season. performances of ''romeo,'' to be directed by michael greif (''grey gardens,'' ''rent''), will begin at the delacorte theater on june 5 and continue through july 8, a week longer than usual. the season's second play, also scheduled for a five-week run, has not been announced.  campbell robertson

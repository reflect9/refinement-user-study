kofi annan, take a deep bow   to the editor:  i take this timely opportunity to tell how much i, and many thousands of others deeply concerned with the continuing world problems of the last 10 years, are grateful for the tenure of kofi annan at the united nations.  in terms of dedication to democratic justice, objective analysis, wise forethought and necessary action without fear of the inevitable criticism, his occupation of the secretary general's hot seat restored the belief that great intelligence and calm insight into the political, economic and social human condition can still exist in an office of virtually universal responsibility.  thank you, kofi annan, for all that you have done for the citizens of the world; for your sanity in its madness, for your rejection of any personal aggrandizement.  i trust that mr. annan is not going to become a private citizen now, although he has every right to grant himself this. we need him to take up some continuing position high in public life that will give the international order -- or rather, disorder -- of the world's resources, material and human, the benefit of his invaluable knowledge and courageous response to the challenges of practical action to achieve peace as the base of international development, fulfillment for nations, peoples and the individual.  nadine gordimer  johannesburg, jan. 8, 2007

easy to say goodbye   to the editor:  re ''for top executives, a need to be aware of the nearest exit'' (the count, jan. 14), which described a record number of chief-executive departures from united states companies last year:  why should a chief executive remain in office when he is guaranteed a fabulous retirement package that is not tied to the company's bottom line? where is the incentive to produce?  i am certain that there are many qualified candidates for c.e.o. jobs who would work for (literally) millions less than stockholders are now paying.  lorna michaelson  tampa, fla., jan. 14

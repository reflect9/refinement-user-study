corrections   an article in weekend on jan. 19 about the film ''waitress,'' which was shown at the sundance film festival, misidentified the role played in ''mission: impossible iii'' by keri russell, the star of ''waitress.'' she was a protégée of tom cruise's character, not his love interest. (that role was played by michelle monaghan.)

arts, briefly; holocaust denier deniers   more than 100 iranian artists and intellectuals signed a statement condemning a holocaust conference, largely given over to holocaust deniers, that was sponsored by the iranian government in tehran in december. the statement, which appears in the forthcoming issue of the new york review of books and on its web site (nybooks.com), begins by acknowledging ''our diverse views on the israeli-palestinian question.'' it condemns the conference's ''attempt to falsify history'' and pays ''homage to the memory of the millions of jewish and non-jewish victims of the holocaust,'' as well as ''other victims of crimes against humanity across the world.'' azar nafisi, the author of ''reading lolita in tehran,'' who helped to create the statement with roya and ladan boroumand, the founders of a human-rights group in iran, said in a telephone interview that many people could not voice their objections to the conference inside iran for fear of reprisals, but that ''we felt that as iranians, we should make a statement'' that the conference ''should not come out in our names.''  patricia cohen

another chance to help   three years ago, the mother of jamaill burl and his twin brother, justin, decided she could not take care of them any longer. since their father was in prison, she left the boys with their grandmother, dorothy townsend, and never came back.  the twins are now 6 years old. ms. townsend cares for them, helps with their homework, and keeps a tidy home. but she has trouble getting around -- the result of a childhood battle with polio and a nasty fall two years ago. she needs physical and financial assistance, and the brooklyn bureau of community service, a beneficiary of the new york times neediest cases fund, provides some.  the bureau's workers take the children to school and help chase after them at home. the bureau also bought ms. townsend and the boys new clothing, beds and a dining set. ms. townsend still struggles to make ends meet, but the bureau helps. ''they did a lot for my boys,'' she said, ''they really did.''  all the money donated to the neediest cases fund goes to one of seven charities: the children's aid society; the brooklyn bureau of community service; catholic charities of the archdiocese of new york; catholic charities, diocese of brooklyn and queens; the community service society of new york; the federation of protestant welfare agencies; and the uja-federation of new york.  to donate, please send your checks to the new york times neediest cases fund, 4 chase metrotech center, 7th floor east, lockbox 5193, brooklyn, n.y. 11245. you may also call (800) 381-0075 and use a credit card, or you may donate online at www.nycharities.org/neediest.  editorial

new strategy for iraq: a closer look; promising troops where they aren't really wanted   as president bush challenges public opinion at home by committing more american troops, he is confronted by a paradox: an iraqi government that does not really want them. the shiite-led government of prime minister nuri kamal al-maliki has not publicly opposed the troop increase, but aides to mr. maliki have been saying for weeks that the government is wary of the proposal.  they fear that an increased american troop presence, particularly in baghdad, will bring a more assertive american role in conflict with the shiite government's haste to cut back on american authority and run the war the way it wants. they want american troops to focus on fighting sunni insurgents.  by sabrina tavernise and john f. burns, page a20

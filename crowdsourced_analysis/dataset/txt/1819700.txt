corrections   an article on tuesday about intestinal surgeries that a spanish newspaper said had been performed on fidel castro referred incorrectly to peritonitis, a serious condition that the newspaper said had afflicted mr. castro after one of the surgeries. peritonitis is an inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity, called the peritoneum; it is not an inflammation of the stomach lining.

typical irish   to the editor:  in his review of colm toibin's ''mothers and sons'' (dec. 31), pico iyer separates toibin from the ''typical irish writer, if you associate such with musical rhapsodies, loquaciousness or blarney.''  typical? who has he been reading? jonathan swift? frank o'connor? elizabeth bowen? benedict kiely? william trevor? john mcgahern? not to mention samuel beckett, so i won't.  there's a long list of writers, many included in the toibin-edited ''penguin book of irish fiction,'' who are spare in their music, blade-sharp and ruthlessly to the point.  ambrose clancy  hampton bays, n.y.

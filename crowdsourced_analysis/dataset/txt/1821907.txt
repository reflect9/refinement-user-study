dominica   situated between the french islands of guadeloupe and martinique in the eastern caribbean, dominica (pronounced dom-in-eek-ah) is the largest and most mountainous of the windward islands, with an area of nearly 290 square miles. more than half of it is covered with tropical forests offering a range of outdoor adventures. hikers, bikers and horseback riders can explore more than 300 miles of trails that wind across valleys, past waterfalls and up mountains reaching heights of nearly 5,000 feet. there are three national parks, more than 365 rivers and streams, and at least 40 dive sites just offshore.  the island has at least eight potentially active volcanoes -- all of which have been mostly silent for the last 1,000 years. but other geothermal features like hot sulfur springs, a boiling lake and warm bubbles that rise up from vents in the ocean floor off a beach the locals call champagne indicate that there is still plenty of volcanic activity.  of course, this is not the place to go to work on your tan. most of dominica's beaches are of the rocky or black-sand variety. but that may not matter while you're taking a long soak in one of the island's natural hot springs.  where to stay -- rooms at jungle bay resort & spa, pointe mul√¢tre, an ecolodge on 55 acres, with 35 free-standing cottages, start at $189 in season, breakfast included, (767-446-1789, www.junglebaydominica.com). the seven-room nature lodge papillote wilderness retreat, above trafalgar village, has its own hot springs and a botanical garden. double rooms are $110 (767-448-2287 www.papillote.dm). beau rive is a small inn on the wild eastern shores of dominica, near castle bruce. double rooms are $160 including breakfast (767-445-8992, www.beaurive.com).  the 10 point caribbean escapes plan: for adventurers michelle higgins, a staff reporter for the travel section, writes the practical traveler column.

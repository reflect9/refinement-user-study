corrections   an article on wednesday about a pointed exchange between cnn and fox news over a web site report that said senator barack obama had attended an islamic school or madrassa in indonesia as a child referred imprecisely to madrassas. while some teach a radical version of islam, most historically have not. (mr. obama's office has said the report is untrue.)

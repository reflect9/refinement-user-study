the neediest cases; a man fights unrelenting pain with faith, and a good night's rest   in high school, laurence cantore's nickname was romeo.  ''i remember that. i remember a girl i met, too,'' said mr. cantore, 63.  memories of a new york life -- of work, of love, of family -- spin through mr. cantore's studio apartment on the upper east side. the walls are decorated with maps, a kite and a floor-to-ceiling photograph of exotic foliage. the view from mr. cantore's window lets him contemplate the east river. ''i see all the boats,'' he said.  mr. cantore draws the outside world indoors because for almost 10 years, pain has limited his life to mostly these four walls.  mr. cantore has post-polio syndrome. the condition, which often causes weakness, fatigue and pain, affects the nerves and muscles of people who have had polio, and may not appear for years after the initial illness. mr. cantore had polio when he was about 5, he said. and some 30 years later, the pain came.  the pain is unrelenting. ''in my spine, my shoulders, my neck, my hip, my right foot now, my thumbs,'' said mr. cantore, who wears a cervical collar to minimize painful movement. the medication that he has been using daily for almost 25 years dulls, but does not alleviate, the discomfort.  ''it's my whole body that's affected,'' mr. cantore said. ''i hear, smell, see, taste so acutely, everything.'' brightness and glare hurt his eyes. ''i have to wear sunglasses when i work on the computer,'' he said.  cold weather is painful. when the temperature is lower than 70 degrees, it feels, he said, ''like somebody breaking a bottle and stabbing me in the back.''  so for almost 10 years now, he has spent about 9 months out of the year inside. mr. cantore cannot open a jar because of muscle weakness. in his fleeting months outside, he cannot walk a long avenue block.  when the weather is warm, mr. cantore likes to ride his scooter, as he calls his motorized chair, to central park. ''look at the birds, look at the trees,'' he said. and he speaks to people about his faith.  mr. cantore was baptized as a jehovah's witness in june 1982. he keeps the calendar with the date on his wall. his religious practice is a source of comfort, connection and study. he pores over a daily reading. twice a week, he listens to services over the phone. he is able to attend a weekly gathering of worshipers in his building.  managing post-polio syndrome takes rest. ''my best medicine is sleep,'' mr. cantore said. but sleep does not come easily, as mr. cantore settles into pain. ''the worst time is when i lay down. i don't want to go to bed at night,'' he said. ''it takes me hours to go to sleep.''  mr. cantore's sleeplessness is made worse because he also has bipolar disorder, which, he says, sometimes keeps him awake and makes the pain worse. ''i'm the type of person, i don't like to sit still,'' he said.  mr. cantore considers himself lucky if he gets five hours of sleep a night, but he says a new medication that he recently began taking to treat the bipolar disorder has helped.  ''the first time i took it, i slept the first time, 11 hours,'' he said.  not having a bed did not help the situation. from about june through october last year, mr. cantore slept in his armchair. ''that's why i'm in this pain,'' he said. ''it put me in worse shape again.''  the air mattress on his foldout couch had deflated and needed replacing. it was an expense that he could not afford on his fixed income. mr. cantore receives $868 in monthly social security disability payments, and is helped along by $50 in food stamps. the rent for his government-subsidized studio is $245.  carol stimpfle, a counselor at the service program for older people, visits mr. cantore weekly. the program is a member agency of the federation of protestant welfare agencies, one of seven agencies supported by the new york times neediest cases fund. she used $289 from the neediest cases to buy a new air mattress, which arrived near the end of october.  the bed is folded out into the room, and the footrest of his chair bumps against it. mr. cantore is too weak to fold up the sofa bed by himself.  he can adjust the firmness of the mattress depending on his level of pain. that way, mr. cantore can find a bit of physical comfort -- even if it does not alleviate a sense of living apart from the rest of the world.  ''i wish i had a wife,'' he said, ''someone to hold. that's how i feel about the bed, in a way.''  how to help  checks payable to the new york times neediest cases fund should be sent to 4 chase metrotech center, 7th floor east, lockbox 5193, brooklyn, n.y. 11245, or any of these organizations:  brooklyn bureau of community service  285 schermerhorn street  brooklyn, n.y. 11217  catholic charities, diocese of brooklyn and queens  191 joralemon street  brooklyn, n.y. 11201  catholic charities of the archdiocese of new york  1011 first avenue  new york, n.y. 10022  children's aid society  105 east 22nd street  new york, n.y. 10010  community service society of new york  105 east 22nd street  new york, n.y. 10010  federation of protestant welfare agencies  281 park avenue south  new york, n.y. 10010  uja-federation of new york  church street station  p.o. box 4100  new york, n.y. 10261-4100  donations may be made with a credit card by phone at (800) 381-0075 or online, courtesy of nycharities.org, an internet donations service, at www.nytimes.com/neediest or www.nycharities.org/neediest. for instructions on how to donate stock to the fund, call (212) 556-1137 or fax (212) 556-4450.  no agents or solicitors are authorized to seek contributions for the new york times neediest cases fund.  the times pays the fund's expenses, so all contributions go directly to the charities, which use them to provide services and cash assistance to the poor.  contributions to the fund are deductible on federal, state and city income taxes to the extent permitted by law.  to delay may mean to forget.  previously recorded: $7,363,501.28  recorded thursday: 13,963.00  total: $7,377,464.28  last year to date: $6,593,664.83  correction:  february 6, 2007, tuesday  a chart with articles on jan. 27, 28 and 29 about the new york times neediest cases fund misstated the amount of donations recorded on jan. 25. it was $13,693, not $13,963. as a result, the chart also misstated the total amount donated as of then. it was $7,377,194.28, not $7,377,464.28.

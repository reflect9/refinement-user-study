costly calls from prison   to the editor:  re ''the bankrupt-your-family calling plan'' (editorial, dec. 22):  in callously gouging some of new york city's poorest, most vulnerable families, new york state's department of correctional services has shown itself better suited to promoting extortion than curbing recidivism in the collect-call-only system that prisoners must use to call their homes.  communication is vital in addressing the feelings of separation and abandonment experienced by the children of prison inmates. regular visits to a far-off prison are beyond the means of inmates' families. the state nonetheless forces them to pay 630 percent more than the average consumer to talk over the phone with imprisoned loved ones.  as i pointed out in a brief challenging the state system, this leaves the children of inmates at greater risk for aggressive behavior and criminal involvement. the positive influence of phone communication can combat these dangerous trends.  protecting new yorkers requires more than bricks and mortar. common sense and decency are also needed.  betsy gotbaum  public advocate  new york, dec. 22, 2006

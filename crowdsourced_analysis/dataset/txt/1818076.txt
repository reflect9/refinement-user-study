corrections   because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a secure telephone that mayor michael r. bloomberg uses in his manhattan town house rendered incorrectly a quotation from him. the mayor said he had occasionally received calls on the secure line asking ''did i want to subscribe to a particular magazine, buy an insurance policy or some other such ridiculous thing.'' he did not say the callers asked ''did i want to subscribe to a ridiculous magazine, buy an insurance policy or some other such particular thing.''

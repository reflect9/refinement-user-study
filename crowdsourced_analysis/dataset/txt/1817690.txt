a rogue wave hits nissan   introduced on sunday: 2008 nissan rogue  is it real? indisputably.  what's the point? it seems as if every brand but nissan has a small crossover utility wagon. enter the rogue, nissan's first appearance at a crowded party where the honda cr-v, ford escape and hyundai santa fe are already guests.  what they said: taking a page from the vw jetta playbook, nissan will pitch the rogue  to younger singles and recently married couples who are sliding down that slippery slope down from their partying days to responsible adulthood.  what they didn't say: while the rogue looks like a strong contender in all other respects, it won't offer a v-6 engine, an option available in many competitors.  how much, how soon? it goes on sale in september as a 2008 model, starting around $20,000.  what makes it tick? the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine produces 170 horsepower, which is directed to the wheels through a continuously variable transmission.  how's it look? with a family resemblance to the larger infiniti fx and nissan murano, the rogue seems to have more of a cute-ute appeal than a rebel streak.

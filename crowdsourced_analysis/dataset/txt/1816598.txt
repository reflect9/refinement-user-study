corrections   an article yesterday about a guilty plea by army specialist juston r. graber to a reduced charge of mercy killing in connection with the deaths of three iraqi men misstated the original charge against him and the maximum punishment three other soldiers could receive if convicted. specialist graber was charged with noncapital murder, not capital murder. the three other soldiers scheduled for courts-martial face life in prison -- not the death penalty -- if convicted.

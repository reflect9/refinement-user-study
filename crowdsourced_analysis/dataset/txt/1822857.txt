world briefing | europe: italy: minister pleads for end to party squabbling   foreign minister massimo d'alema issued an urgent plea to his political allies for an end to the bickering among parties that he worries could bring down the center-left government of prime minister romano prodi. ''i am going to japan,'' he said in an interview in the newspaper la repubblica. ''i humbly ask our allies: let there still be a government on my return.'' since taking power from silvio berluconi last spring, mr. prodi has faced deep divisions in his diverse, nine-party coalition. in recent days, a proposed law allowing for same-sex unions has added tension.  ian fisher

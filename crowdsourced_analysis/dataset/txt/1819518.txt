world briefing | europe: france: parliament acts on presidential immunity   the lower house of parliament approved a bill that would make a president immune from prosecution while in office but create a united states-style impeachment procedure before parliament in any case of ''grave failing.'' the bill would leave a president exposed to charges once his term ended. if passed by the senate, the bill would mean that president jacques chirac, who has been in office for 12 years and has not ruled out running for a third term as an independent, could be investigated on allegations of corruption in the paris region during his 18 years as mayor.  ariane bernard

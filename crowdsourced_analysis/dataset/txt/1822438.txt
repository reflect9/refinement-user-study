corrections   an article on jan. 21 about mexico's extradition of drug traffickers to the united states incorrectly described a november 2005 decision by mexico's supreme court that cleared the way for the extraditions. the court ruled that extraditions could proceed if the accused faced a possible life sentence without parole, which mexican courts had previously held violated the country's constitution. the court did not overturn the prohibition on extraditions in which the accused would face the death penalty. (none of the accused drug traffickers extradited on jan. 19 face the death penalty, justice department officials say.)  the article also misstated the number of people extradited. it was 15, not 21.

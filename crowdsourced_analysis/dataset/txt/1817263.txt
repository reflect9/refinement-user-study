in defending robeson, respect ol' blue eyes   to the editor:  re ''the missing hero'' (editorial, dec. 31):  i applaud your comments about the injustice done to paul robeson by the nominating panel for the new jersey hall of fame. but i suggest that an additional injustice was perpetrated by your characterization of frank sinatra as ''a celebrity remembered for his general orneriness as much as for any contributions to the garden state.''  let me note that mr. sinatra would have been among the first to support your position on mr. robeson. but unless one has been living in a cave for the past six decades, it must be acknowledged that frank sinatra left us with an extraordinarily rich legacy of music, as well as a vivid sense of his fierce advocacy for social equity and justice.  these characteristics of the kid from hoboken shed a positive light on new jersey and contributed substantially to the state's image. to relegate his memory to ''orneriness'' is to deny reality.  sheldon roskin  scotch plains  the writer was frank sinatra's public relations representative during the 1970s and '80s.

running hot and cold   to the editor: i went from seeing the global warming documentary ''an inconvenient truth'' the night before to reading ''being cold is the hot trend this winter'' (in transit, dec. 17) the next morning. i could have been watching the part of the movie where animated ice blocks drop into a warming ocean. unfortunately, i was reading about reality. people are actually paying to experience what is rapidly becoming extinct: freezing cold. this kind of energy waste only adds to global warming. the only thing missing from the article was a 21st-century marie antoinette-type saying ''let them eat popsicles.''  ellen luborsky  new york

invest in cancer research   to the editor:  re ''second drop in cancer deaths could point to a trend, researchers say'' (news article, jan. 18):  news that cancer deaths have dropped for the second year is certain to be met with great optimism.  early detection, improved treatments and actions taken to prevent getting cancer in the first place have clearly had a significant effect. but this news is not reason to become complacent in the face of a scourge that kills more than half a million people in the united states each year.  we must remain mindful that there are many cancers that are not prevented by changes in behavior or lifestyle. and while encouraging advances are being made all the time, five-year survival rates for some cancers are still abysmal, and these diseases require a greater investment in research.  cuts in money for research are already jeopardizing potentially lifesaving programs. investing in cancer research must remain the nation's highest priority until cures are found.  dwayne howell  president and c.e.o.  leukemia & lymphoma society  white plains, jan. 22, 2007

cleaner coal investment   to the editor:  thomas l. friedman (''my favorite green lump,'' column, jan. 10) urges washington to co-invest in advanced coal to identify ways to reduce carbon dioxide. we already are.  although not reported in major media, on nov. 30 the treasury department awarded nearly $1 billion in tax credits to help offset the cost of nearly $10 billion in private investment to build nine advanced coal projects. the energy department also awarded a $235 million grant to match $300 million by a private utility to build a coal gasification facility in florida.  with another $650 million in tax credits this year leveraging billions more in private dollars, we should produce more than a dozen commercial-scale coal projects holding the promise of lower carbon dioxide.  this builds on the $2.2 billion president bush dedicated to clean coal research that culminates with the energy department's futuregen initiative, a $1 billion international partnership to build and operate the world's first coal-fueled, near-zero emissions power plant by 2012.  james l. connaughton  chairman, white house council on environmental quality  washington, jan. 13, 2007

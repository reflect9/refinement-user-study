metro briefing | new york: fire department relents on locker policy   the new york fire department bowed to its largest union yesterday by amending a policy that prohibited firefighters from having anything but their names and locker numbers on the outside of their lockers. the policy was intended to keep racist and pornographic material out of the city's firehouses after a string of complaints. but the uniformed firefighters association said the ban had been carried too far when unit commanders began clearing locker doors of flag stickers, mass cards commemorating fallen colleagues, and other items. the union threatened to sue if the policy was not changed by today. late yesterday, fire commissioner nicholas scoppetta, above, issued new regulations spelling out prohibited material, including sexually explicit photographs and any discriminatory or obscene material.  ray rivera

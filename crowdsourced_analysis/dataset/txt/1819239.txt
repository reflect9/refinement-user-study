rules changes   lobbyists are not the only ones who wine and dine lawmakers and their staff members. journalists hoping to lubricate sources sit elbow-to-elbow with lobbyists at the same washington steakhouses and watering holes. and, perhaps inadvertently, the new ethics rules passed by the house require lawmakers and aides to be very careful about letting reporters pick up the tab.  the new rule bars lawmakers and their aides from accepting meals paid for by employees of companies that also pay registered lobbyists. among others, that includes journalists working for the major television networks, the wall street journal and the washington post. the new york times company, however, does not employ a registered lobbyist, so its reporters can still pick up the check.  david d. kirkpatrick  political action

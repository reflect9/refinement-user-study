airline code sharing   to the editor: regarding ''airline alliances: decoding the mysteries of the code share'' (practical traveler, dec. 17): anyone knowing, or even suspecting, that their flight is code-shared should call both airlines to verify their check-in location. my wife took a united flight to budapest recently, but it was a code share with, and operated by, lufthansa. fortunately, i double-checked so she knew to go to lufthansa's counter rather than united's.  and regarding a q&a item from dec. 17 about a layover at charles de gaulle airport: charles de gaulle is a nightmare. connecting there last march en route to istanbul with a one-hour layover, we faced two long walks, a bus ride, two security checks, totally inadequate signage and unhelpful personnel. we barely made it. avoid short layovers there if possible.  richard rosichan  miami beach, fla.

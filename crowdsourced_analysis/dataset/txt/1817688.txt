the bevel is in the details   introduced on sunday: nissan bevel design study  is it real? as real as the faux solar panel that's supposed to power a 110-volt tailgate outlet. to be fair, the bevel probably sets a new standard for the largest blind spot in any vehicle.  what's the point? tokyo whimsy; a showcase of ideas that should go no further.  what they said: nissan aims the bevel at men ''entering their second act,'' ages 45-60. according to nissan's research, these retreads drive alone roughly 90 percent of the time.  what they didn't say: to its credit, nissan has discovered a large, previously untapped demographic: lonely, divorced middle-age guys.  what makes it tick? the bevel features seats that fold to create an easy-to-clean aluminum load floor; a fold-out rear work platform, a ''ribbon'' instrument panel that slides into position and pop-up ''pucks'' on the roof to carry cargo. if none of this makes sense to you, you're not alone.  how much, how soon? we are grateful that the bevel is strictly a one-shot concept for the show circuit.  how's it look? the bevel is a manga matchbox toy with overtones of a vacuum cleaner attachment, resplendent in a watery yellow-bronze sheen that appears to be a symptom of kidney disease.

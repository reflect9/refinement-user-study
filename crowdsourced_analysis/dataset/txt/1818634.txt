why we travel| pine ridge indian reservation, s.d.   lori eichhorn, 35, owner of a home-cleaning business and a single mother of three from chaska, minn., with camera: ''we were there with probably 10 or 12 families from our church to put a kids' summer camp together, and we had a free evening so we went to the powwow. we didn't know anything about the oglala lakota nation before we went, and i was glad that my 7-year-old son kaleb could be there to experience their culture. we heard a couple of older gentlemen speak about the history of their people and trying to get back to a place of community where they can support themselves and invest in their own communities. they're a very close people there. here, our families are seemingly falling apart these days. when i heard these guys talk, it was all about home, the land, taking care of our families. it gave me this longing in my gut to think that it could ever be that way again.''  as told to austin considine

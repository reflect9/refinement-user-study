the urge to spend, or not   to the editor:  re ''the voices in my head say 'buy it!' why argue?'' (findings, jan. 16): the answer to the question of what makes some people more responsive than others to the act of buying may very well in part be an issue of brain physiology. it should not be ignored, however, that upbringing and the life experiences that shape one's personality and identity over time contribute to whether one has a predilection for handing over cash and acquiring new things.  as a student of anthropology, i cannot help thinking what interesting results could arise from a longitudinal study of how, and by what, the specific ''shopping responsive'' parts of the brain are conditioned and made to be more responsive to this commercial or that sale.  justin bean  ann arbor, mich.

metro briefing | new york: albany: increased disclosure for legislative grants   attorney general andrew m. cuomo said yesterday that all future recipients of so-called member items -- grants that lawmakers steer to community groups and pet projects in their home districts -- would be required to meet detailed new disclosure requirements before the money was disbursed. the recipients would have to reveal any potential conflict of interest with the lawmaker. mr. cuomo said yesterday that such conflicts would not necessarily prevent groups from receiving money, but that the new requirements would lend transparency to what has been a highly secretive process. ''when people don't know, people get suspicious,'' mr. cuomo said.  nicholas confessore

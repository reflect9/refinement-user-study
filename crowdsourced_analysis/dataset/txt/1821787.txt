pakistan and the taliban   to the editor:  re ''from pakistan, with jihad'' (editorial, jan. 23):  many of the achievements against al qaeda and the taliban would not have been possible without the cooperation of pakistan.  a united nations report in september 2006 identifies five distinct leadership centers of the insurgency, all located within afghanistan.  pakistan has captured or killed more than 600 terrorists and conducted more than 90 military operations in our frontier regions, losing 600 soldiers. to prevent infiltration and attacks across the mountainous border between pakistan and afghanistan, we have deployed 80,000 troops and established 950 border posts.  we intend to selectively fence and mine the border and more closely regulate legal border traffic.  success in combating religious extremism and the taliban cannot be achieved by military means alone. pakistan is pursuing a comprehensive strategy in its frontier regions that involves military action, political reconciliation and economic reconstruction and development. we advocate the same approach in afghanistan.  munir akram  permanent representative  pakistan mission to the u.n.  new york, jan. 25, 2007

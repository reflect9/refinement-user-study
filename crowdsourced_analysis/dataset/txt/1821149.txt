a chinatown banh mi shop breaks out of the mold   shops selling banh mi, the hearty vietnamese sandwiches that involve various meats, vegetables and pickles layered on crisp baguettes, are usually small mom-and-pop affairs. a slicker, more spacious version, paris sandwich, opened a few weeks ago in chinatown. it serves a dozen kinds of banh mi ($3.25 to $3.50), summer rolls ($3) and some rice and noodle dishes with chicken or pork ($4.25 to $5). the baguettes, which are also sold plain or buttered, are baked on the premises, and the banh mi, especially the somewhat sloppy vietnamese meatball version, make a satisfying lunch: 113 mott street (canal street), (212) 226-7221.  food stuff

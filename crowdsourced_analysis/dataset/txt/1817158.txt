editor's note; about the tables   beginning today, sunday business is making its financial tables more concise, reflecting the growing use of listings online and the increasing cost of newsprint.  the tables for the new york stock exchange, the nasdaq stock market and the american stock exchange will continue to show the 52-week high and low for each stock but will no longer show the weekly high and low, volume, dividend, yield or price-to-earnings ratio. the table for preferred stocks will no longer show the volume, dividend or yield.  the mutual funds table will continue to list those with assets of $200 million or more. it will no longer show the four-week percentage return but will have a rotating column that shows returns over three months, one year and three years.  the table for money market mutual funds is being eliminated. instead, two smaller tables, one listing the 10 largest funds and the other showing the top 10 funds by seven-day yield, will appear on the databank page.  the table for closed-end funds and funds traded on the stock exchanges will now show only the last price and the weekly change.  comprehensive information on stocks, mutual funds and other investments is online at www.nytimes.com/business.  comments about the changes may be e-mailed to tables@nytimes.com or telephoned to (212) 556-3715.

corrections   a news analysis article yesterday about a bill on stem cell research passed by the house misstated one of its provisions. the measure would allow scientists receiving federal funds to use embryonic stem cells from surplus embryos generated in fertility clinics, after the cell lines had been derived by others using nonfederal funds. the federally supported scientists would not derive the cell lines themselves.

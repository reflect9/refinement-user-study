corrections   a brief report on thursday about andrea stewart-cousins, a freshman new york state senator, in an article about the opening session of the state legislature, misstated the number of new senators taking office and referred imprecisely to the historical significance of ms. stewart-cousins' election. counting ms. stewart-cousins, there are seven new senators; she is not the only one. she is one of a few candidates in recent years to have won by defeating an incumbent; more commonly, newcomers win by running for open seats.

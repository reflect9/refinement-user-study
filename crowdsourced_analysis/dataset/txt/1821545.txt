corrections   an article on aug. 31 about a decision by the roman catholic archdiocese of new york to give some priests accused of child sexual abuse the choice of leaving the priesthood or moving to supervised housing in westchester county -- an option that was later canceled -- misstated the jurisdiction of the archdiocese. it covers manhattan, staten island and the bronx in new york city, and seven other downstate counties -- not all of new york city and five other downstate counties. the error was discovered recently by a reporter reviewing the times's archives.

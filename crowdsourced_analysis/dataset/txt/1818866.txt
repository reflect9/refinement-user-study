correction   an article on jan. 7 about representative john hall, a democrat newly elected to the 19th congressional district of new york and a former member of the band orleans, referred incorrectly to a member of the band. larry hoppen was the group's lead singer and played keyboards and guitar; he was not its bass guitarist. (bass guitar was played by lance hoppen, larry's brother.)

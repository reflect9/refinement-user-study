new strategy for iraq: a closer look; inviting a battle on capitol hill   in making the effort to step up the american military presence in iraq, president bush invites an epic clash with the democrats who run capitol hill, whose leader, nancy pelosi, promised to force a vote on his plan. while congress cannot force a change in the white house plan, mr. bush's initiative shows that he is ignoring the results of the november elections, rejecting the central thrust of the bipartisan iraq study group and flouting the advice of some of his own generals.  the move is in essence a calculated gamble that no matter how much hue and cry his new strategy may provoke, in the end the american people will give mr. bush more time to turn around the war in iraq.  news analysis by sheryl gay stolberg, page a19

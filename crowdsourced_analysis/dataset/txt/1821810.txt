arts, briefly; a novelist under threat   the turkish novelist elif shafak, below, has sharply curtailed her book tour in the united states because of fears for her safety, her publisher said yesterday. ms. shafak was scheduled to promote her new novel, ''the bastard of istanbul,'' in six cities, including chicago, los angeles and seattle, but has canceled everything but a visit to new york on feb. 5. ms. shafak has been sued by a right-wing turkish attorney, kemal kerincsiz, who said her new novel's characters were guilty of ''insulting turkishness'' by referring to the ''millions'' of armenians ''massacred'' by turks. ms. shafak was placed under police protection in turkey, where she lives part time, after the murder of hrant dink, a newspaper editor who was prosecuted for challenging the official turkish version of the 1915 armenian genocide. paul slovak, the publisher of viking, said that while ms. shafak had received no specific threats in the united states, she had been attacked as an ''enemy of the state'' on ultra-nationalist web sites. ''it's a situation where you want to be as careful as you can and not take any chances,'' he said.  julie bosman

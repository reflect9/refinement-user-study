new strategy for iraq: a closer look; a bid to stabilize a city, and a government   president bush's new plan differs in several respects from the faltering effort to bring stability to baghdad that began last summer. it calls for a much larger american force. there are to be no safe havens for renegade militias. and iraqi security forces throughout the city are to be put under the direct control of a new iraqi commander -- and backed up by american army battalions.  but the plan depends on the good intentions and competence of a shiite-dominated iraqi government that has not demonstrated an abundant supply of either. mr. bush, in effect, is betting that iraqi leaders are committed to building a multisectarian state, and his strategy will stand or fall on that assumption.  military analysis by michael r. gordon, page a20

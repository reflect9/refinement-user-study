questions for yusuf islam   if i remember correctly, yusuf islam (formerly known as cat stevens) did on many occasions publicly support the fatwa that called for the assassination of salman rushdie simply for writing a novel (deborah solomon, jan. 7). it was hypocritical of him to state that he has ''never supported . . . any group that did other than charity and good to humankind'' and then claim he is ''a man who does want peace for this world.''  his song and the words presented in this interview are way off-key.  terry n. crawford  tigard, ore.  muslims -- those who are famous like yusuf islam and many who are not -- while quick to condemn terrorism, often cannot bring themselves to condemn terrorists by name, thereby reinforcing the view that they generally support groups like hamas and hezbollah. what hope do we have for peace when islam's spokesmen cannot speak out clearly and without use of coded phrases?  stephen m. flatow  west orange, n.j.  how are we ever going to achieve peace in the middle east if we are not allowed to talk to the ''bad guys'' (and anyone who does is considered a ''bad guy''). the behavior of hamas is abhorrent, but i believe long-term change will come only with dialogue, and perhaps the interview could have focused on how we begin this dialogue -- that's the real challenge.  nancy banks  acton, mass.

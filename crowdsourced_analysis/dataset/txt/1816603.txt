corrections   an article in business day yesterday about a proposed high-definition videodisc that will play on rival technologies referred incorrectly to one capability of the blu-ray players, a rival to the hd-dvd technology. blu-ray players do, in fact, play standard dvds, as do hd-dvd players. one difference is that some new hd-dvd discs are sold in a combination format that will also play on standard dvd players, while blu-ray discs currently do not have this feature.

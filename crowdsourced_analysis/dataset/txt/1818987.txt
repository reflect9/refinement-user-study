proof of steroid use not needed   to the sports editor:  re ''2 stars leap to hall of fame, but steroid cloud stops 3rd,'' jan. 10: the standard line about steroids sluggers or human growth hormone heroes is that there is no proof they took drugs. we don't have admissions or failed drug tests or documents showing a schedule of injections.  but substantial circumstantial evidence certainly exists, such as whether a change in appearance can be reasonably attributed to natural causes or to drug use. circumstantial evidence is used every day in courtrooms across america to prove that something, more likely than not, happened.  robert l. liebross  denver

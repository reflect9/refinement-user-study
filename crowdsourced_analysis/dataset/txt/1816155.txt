corrections   because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about an investigation into the possibility that banks are luring hedge funds as tenants in order to solicit their trading business misstated the nature of a request made by the massachusetts secretary of state, william f. galvin, to ubs, the swiss bank. while mr. galvin has requested information from ubs, he has not issued a subpoena. ubs is cooperating with the inquiry.

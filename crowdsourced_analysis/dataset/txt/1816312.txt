a big hero in the big city   new yorkers have long rolled their eyes when politicians, tv commercials and after-dinner speakers endlessly extolled ''small-town values.'' the truth is that integrity, compassion and heroism are no scarcer on the sidewalks of chicago or harlem than they are in dubuque. if anyone doubts this, they should consider wesley autrey's heroic turn at the 137th street and broadway subway station this week.  mr. autrey, a construction worker who lives in the neighborhood, was riding the subway with his 6- and 4-year-old daughters when a young film student had a seizure on the platform. he and two women went to help the young man, 20-year-old cameron hollopeter, but mr. hollopeter stumbled while he was getting up and fell onto the tracks.  as a no. 1 train approached, mr. autrey jumped down onto the tracks and lay on top of mr. hollopeter, pushing into a space that was about a foot deep. five cars traveled over the two men before the train screeched to a halt. it passed just inches above mr. autrey's head, leaving grease on his knit cap.  mr. autrey's instinctive willingness to put his life on the line is not something most people would expect to encounter in new york city. but then, the negative stereotypes about new york have never stood up to the facts. uncharitable? new york ranks first in a newly released state-by-state study of giving by the boston college center on wealth and philanthropy. less committed than the rest of the country to the nation's defense? new york city has lost more of its residents in battle in iraq than the average state.  not willing to come to the aid of strangers? mr. autrey put that one to rest in dramatic fashion. small-town values are certainly an important part of what makes america great, but so are big-city values, which in many cases are exactly the same.  editorial

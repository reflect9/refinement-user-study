the gift-card economy   i have noticed that children are receiving more and more gift cards for birthdays (freakonomics, stephen j. dubner and steven d. levitt, jan. 7). it's fun for my son to pick out a gift, but i'm the one who has to take him to borders or toys ''r'' us. and the item he decides on may cost more than the amount on the card. i see this as an unfortunate off-loading of the gift-buying process to the parent of the recipient. isn't it enough that i give the party?  alice kelly  newtown, mass.  so, 19 percent of people never use their gift cards? i bet that is a lower percentage than those who never wear that ugly sweater or loud tie.  dave kanzler  oak brook, ill.

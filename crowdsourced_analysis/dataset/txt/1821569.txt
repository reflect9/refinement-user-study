film in review; from other worlds   opens today in manhattan  directed by barry strugatz  not rated; 88 minutes  aliens offer a cure for earthling ennui in ''from other worlds,'' a limp sci-fi comedy with fewer laughs than a meeting of abductees anonymous. when joanne (cara buono), a despondent wife and mother, develops a fascination with dead fish and a fan-shaped skin blemish, she naturally suspects an otherworldly cause. grappling with blackouts and an unreliable brooklyn accent, she heads for a u.f.o. support group at which neighborhood losers vie for the extraterrestrial-sighting record and, apparently, the title of most unfortunate hair.  there joanne meets abraham (isaach de bankol√©), a dour african who sells bootleg watches and bears an identical skin discoloration. joining forces, they track down a garrulous alien who instructs them -- in a vocal hybrid of liberace and the police inspector from ''young frankenstein'' -- on how to save the world. instructions on how to save the script are not forthcoming.  flirting with fantasy, farce and social commentary and committing to none, the writer and director barry strugatz pads his film with ill-conceived characters (melissa leo as a coy librarian) and embarrassing puns (''you've been acting really spaced out recently''). meanwhile his two leads, displaying less chemistry than an american high-school transcript, stagger toward their respective awakenings like dazed lemmings in a movie that never finds a consistent tone.  jeannette catsoulis

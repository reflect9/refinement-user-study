arts, briefly; a maestro takes leave   the conductor kent nagano, below, said friday he would leave the small local orchestra in california that gave him his start nearly three decades ago. mr. nagano, 55, said he would step down as music director of the berkeley symphony orchestra after the 2008-9 season, his 30th, but would continue to conduct as a guest. the orchestra gives a half-dozen concerts a year and is known for innovative programming and for mr. nagano's loyalty to it. but this season he started posts as music director of the montreal symphony and the bavarian state opera in munich. scheduling conflicts and longer stretches away prompted him to step down, he said. ''to be able to be effectively serve a community, you have to be very, very much involved,'' he said.  daniel j. wakin

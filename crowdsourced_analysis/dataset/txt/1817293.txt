the island's farmland is good for our health   to the editor:  re ''preserve open space? yes, for development'' (letter, dec. 31):  because long island's remaining farmland is valuable, it needs to be preserved for development? wait a second! why aren't open spaces and unpolluted air and water valuable?  one sure way to eat well (avoiding e. coli, for example) is to ''eat local'' to the degree that we can. with the farms gone, what happens to local and organic produce, neighborhood farm stands, green markets and artisanal, as opposed to mass-produced, dairy products?  the industrial revolution contributed to some of our worst problems: pollution, overcrowded cities, exploitation of the poor, child labor and global warming. maybe the luddites were on to something. and maybe we should have listened.  teresa taylor  greenport

inquiry into gosman's, up for sale, continues   gosman's dock, a family-owned seafood complex in operation in montauk since the 1940s, has been the subject of public interest lately -- for more than one reason.  last month, gosman's, 11 acres of prime waterfront commercial real estate that includes four restaurants, five retail stores, a commercial dock and wholesale seafood business, a seafood and gourmet food shop, two motels and several separate houses, was listed for sale with brown harris stevens of the hamptons for $55 million. at the request of its client, the agency declined to comment on the listing.  later in the month, on dec. 13, more than 30 agents of the state department of environmental conservation and the national marine fisheries service and detectives from the suffolk county district attorney's office arrived at the fish market with a search warrant to check records related to the landing, purchase and sale of fish.  robert clifford, a spokesman for the district attorney, thomas j. spota, said that the visit was part of an investigation into the purchase of illegally landed fish. because the investigation was continuing, he said, he could not comment further.  capt. timothy huss of the department of environmental conservation's long island regional enforcement division, said the state had received indications that several boats from florida had not, as required, reported fish -- for example, fluke, tuna, porgies and striped bass -- that had been unloaded last summer. all harvesters and dealers must report what is landed, bought and sold, he said.  members of the gosman family had no comment, either on the investigation or on the pending sale of the business.  linda saslow  the week

better late than never   the colts' four chartered buses pulled up to the fort lauderdale hotel that will serve as their headquarters a few minutes late monday, although some would argue they were running much later than that considering their opponents, the bears, traveled to south florida on sunday.  tony dungy decided to give his players an extra day to spend with their families in indianapolis before joining the party well under way.  ''we wanted to do it that way,'' dungy said. ''we thought it was best for us to win.''  dungy reasoned that the colts needed rest more than any super bowl-related recreation. they had not enjoyed a weekend off since their open date oct. 15. ''we had a great week of practice wednesday, thursday and friday,'' dungy said. ''we had a great workout this morning.''  noting that the players will have the rest of tuesday to themselves after meeting with the news media in the morning, tight end dallas clark said: ''we normally have tuesdays off, and after meeting with the media, we'll get the rest of the day to explore miami. i think it's really going to help the players not to throw them off their regular week of work.''  before the colts left, dungy tried to drive home the point that this was a business trip. ''we've got to look at this as our time to do it now,'' he said, ''and i think we'll be focused in on it.''  karen crouse  n.f.l. roundup

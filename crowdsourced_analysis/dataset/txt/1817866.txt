corrections   an obituary on friday about vincent sardi jr., who owned and managed the broadway landmark sardi's restaurant for more than half a century, misstated the year in which he was on okinawa as a member of the marines helping to supervise a rest camp. it was 1945, after united states forces had taken control of the island, not 1943.

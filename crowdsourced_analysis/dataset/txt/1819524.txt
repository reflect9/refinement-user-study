national briefing | midwest: wisconsin: man charged in killing of hunter   a white hunter has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of a hmong immigrant from laos who was hunting squirrels in a wildlife refuge in northern wisconsin on jan. 5. the hunter, james a. nichols, 28, says he encountered the immigrant, cha vang, in the woods while hunting and shot him in self-defense after a confrontation. mr. vang's body was discovered a day later hidden beneath leaves and wood, and autopsy results showed he died from multiple stab and gunshot wounds. the criminal complaint states that mr. nichols told the police that the ''hmong group are bad'' and that the hmong ''are mean and kill everything'' and ''go for anything that moves.'' many in the hmong community have said they wonder if the killing was in retaliation for a 2004 episode in which a hmong hunter shot and killed six white hunters in north-central wisconsin after they accused him of trespassing.  libby sander

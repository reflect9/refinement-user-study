bloomberg's leadership   to the editor:  re ''the mayor and his tax cuts'' (editorial, jan. 18):  the tax cuts proposed by mayor michael r. bloomberg are a testament to how far new york city has come in the past five years under his leadership.  after years of prudent budgeting, the mayor understands that continued growth is dependent upon reinvestment in our economy. by reducing the financial burden on citizens and businesses and eliminating the city sales tax on clothing and shoes, new york will be better able to compete not only within the region, but also on a national and international scale.  let's give the mayor and his administration the support and congratulations that they have rightly earned.  william c. rudin  chairman  association for a better new york  new york, jan. 18, 2007

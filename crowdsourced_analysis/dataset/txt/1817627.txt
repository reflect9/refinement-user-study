swarming on the corner   q. why do tiny flying insects form hovering masses in spring and summer?  a. think of the swarms as college mixers in miniature, with a highly condensed timeline from introduction to reproduction, entomologists suggest. like the more familiar swarms of social insects, including termites and bees, swarms of smaller flying insects provide a convenient and efficient mating ground for short-lived young adults.  in most such swarms, the males wait in a compact mass for receptive females, but in at least one species, the roles are reversed. a 2004 swedish study in the journal of insect behavior described the mating habits of the species empis borealis.  from 1 to 40 females ''gather at landmarks called swarm markers, like trees and bushes, and males carrying an insect prey visit these swarms for mating,'' the researchers wrote.  ''we noticed earlier that some swarm sites were used for several years and that they appeared to be frequented by a similar number of swarming females in each year,'' the report continued.  some of the swarm sites were used for 18 years. the swarm sites with the largest number of flies had a high sun exposure during the day and were found at coniferous trees in a mixed forest habitat.  in general, swarming off the premises of the nest or home territory offers the best chance both for genetic mixing and for finding an appropriate mate in a brief life span.  c. claiborne ray  q & a

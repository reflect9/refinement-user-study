never too early for pollsters   let the hypotheticals begin. conventional wisdom may say senator hillary rodham clinton of new york is the democrats' prohibitive front-runner. but a newsweek poll released over the weekend, which otherwise shows the candidates tightly bunched, indicates that former senator john edwards, below, is the only one to beat the top two potential republican candidates in head-to-head matchups. the poll shows that mr. edwards, of north carolina, mrs. clinton and senator barack obama of illinois all would beat senator john mccain of arizona by a few percentage points. but rudolph w. giuliani, the former new york mayor, would narrowly defeat senators clinton and obama while losing to mr. edwards, 45 percent to 48 percent. but the numbers are all close and fall within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.  the matchups, in percentages:  edwards 48, mccain 43  clinton 48, mccain 47  obama 46, mccain 44  edwards 48, giuliani 45  giuliani 48, clinton 47  giuliani 47, obama 45  john m. broder  political action: the 2008 race

corrections   an art review on thursday about the exhibition ''south bronx contemporary: longwood arts project's 25th anniversary,'' at hostos community college in the bronx, omitted a curator. the wall of art hung salon-style was organized by edwin ramoran under the title ''everyday is like sunday''; it is not part of ''iconoclasm,'' organized by eddie torres and hanging in the same room.  a picture caption with the review misstated the given name of a former director of the longwood arts project who is also one of the curators of the show. as noted in the review, he is fred wilson, not frank.

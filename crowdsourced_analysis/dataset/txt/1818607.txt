'flowers of evil'   to the editor:  joshua clover's review of keith waldrop's translation of baudelaire's ''flowers of evil'' (dec. 31) consists of 11 paragraphs. nine of these summarize baudelaire's life and poetry and only two discuss the translation at all, if only briefly. the ratio might well be reversed, so that readers might have a better idea of the translation and its relation to the originals.  david c. garron  wilmette, ill.  to the editor  thank you for publishing joshua clover's brilliant review of keith waldrop's translation of baudelaire. it was a delight to read such a thorough and knowledgeable consideration of poetry in the book review.  louis asekoff  tivoli, n.y.

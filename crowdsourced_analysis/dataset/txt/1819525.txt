national briefing | washington: immigrant centers inspected   a federal inspection of 5 of the nation's 325 immigrant detention centers found that most did not provide timely and responsive health care and sometimes failed to comply with the government's standards of disciplining, classifying and housing detainees. the audit by the department of homeland security also found a rape of a detainee in one center and a failure to provide access to legal services in another. three centers did not translate handbooks into spanish and other languages. homeland security officials said the study was too small to be representative of the country's detention centers.  rachel swarns

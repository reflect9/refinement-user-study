corrections   a headline with an article in some copies on dec. 24 about the death of three people in vehicular accidents in new york omitted one of the boroughs where a fatality occurred. besides brooklyn and staten island, there was a fatality in queens. the article also misstated the sequence of events in the queens accident. according to the police, a car driven by steven azconza of westbury, n.y., struck a car driven by melvin santana of queens; mr. santana did not strike mr. azconza's car. the accident killed mr. santana's passenger, wendy almonte of queens; an earlier version of the article misidentified the victim in that accident as the driver of the second car. a reader pointed out the error involving the sequence of events in an e-mail message on jan. 16.

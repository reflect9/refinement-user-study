corrections   an article on jan. 14 about efforts by the carnegie, ford and rockefeller foundations to improve their operations referred incorrectly to the spike lee documentary on new orleans, ''when the levees broke,'' which was underwritten by the rockefeller foundation. the documentary itself, in dvd form, is the basis of a curriculum on poverty developed by teachers college at columbia. it is not being used to create 20-to-30 minute dvds for the curriculum.

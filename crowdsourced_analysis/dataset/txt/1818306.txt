living here | getaways with incomes; going commercial   who -- jason goldwater, 35, of las vegas, an associate creative director at an advertising agency and a co-owner of a waxing salon, shown with his wife, bree goldwater, 34, also a co-owner of the salon  what -- studio apartment with adjoining commercial space  where -- telluride, colo.  telluride is home to one of the very first hydroelectric power plants, and this building used to belong to the telluride power company. when you walk in the front door, there's a little slot. it says ''bills.'' our windows look out on the gondola station and mountains. nothing will get built there.  we live in las vegas, but i'd been coming to telluride for years. when our daughter was born, i began trying to convince bree we could move here permanently and live happily ever after. that fell on deaf ears. but when my half-brother expressed interest in starting a business, and told us his daughter, berkeley, was attending aesthetician school, bree and i got to thinking about trying it out, since berkeley could run the shop. our salon is about 300 square feet and the rest of the commercial space is a real estate office.  living in a commercial building can be funky. the bathroom, for example, has two doors, one that was designed as a public entrance for the community, and one that was for the office workers. you can have a bath in there during business hours, but you have to be very careful.  we didn't want to compromise the integrity of the building, so we didn't put in a kitchen. we have a microwave and a little fridge for necessities, but we mostly go out to eat. that's fine with us. the restaurants here are great, and berkeley's husband runs two of the nearby gyro carts, so we're about 100 feet from the best sandwiches in town.  as told to bethany lyttle  information on properties were supplied by the listing companies.  where -- mendocino, calif.  what -- office or retail building with apartment  how much -- $1,195,000  this 1,900-square-foot former house on main street in mendocino has views of the ocean from its apartment, which has two bedrooms and one bathroom. the ground floor, which has a fireplace, bay windows and one bathroom, can be used for offices or as retail space. the property includes a barn that is currently used as a retail space. headlands state park is within walking distance. mendocino is 150 miles north of san francisco. agent: scott deitz, century 21 - seascape realty, (707) 937-9220;

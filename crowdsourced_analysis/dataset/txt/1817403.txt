keeping libraries open   to the editor:  re ''lock the library! rowdy students are taking over'' (front page, jan. 2) captures a struggle many public libraries are working hard to address: how to balance the growing demand for a community ''living room'' space for preteens and teenagers with the desire for more technology and with the continuing need for more traditional quiet space for research and information.  we've seen many examples where teenagers actively seek out the library and where library staffs and boards collaborate successfully with teenager advisory groups to plan programs that provide a structured after-school environment for this age group.  there are many communities in new york and new jersey where teenagers coexist peacefully in libraries along with adults. elizabeth, princeton and queens, to name a few, have librarians who specialize in working with this age group in a way that engages them and makes them lifetime library users.  unfortunately, many of our libraries are continually being asked to do more with the same or less money and staffing. libraries are a vital ''third place'' for people of all ages and backgrounds. we must work together to find and fund solutions that balance the range of community needs while keeping our libraries open to all.  leslie burger  pres., american library assn.  chicago, jan. 5, 2007

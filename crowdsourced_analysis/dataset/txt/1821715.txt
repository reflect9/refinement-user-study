a new wave now knits for the rebellion of it   in 2000 the getcrafty.com web site offered a pattern for a crocheted skull (not for the faint of heart, or needle), recasting traditional ''women's work'' for the post-riotgrrrl era. that same year groups of women and the occasional sensitive guy began gathering on sundays to swap ideas and patterns in an organization called the church of craft.  though needlework as politics may be new in the museum setting, in recent years ''making things by hand has come back in a big way among younger people,'' said debbie stoller, the author of a best-selling series of books, ''stitch 'n bitch,'' which extols the virtues of craft circles, and the editor of bust magazine. ''for a lot of people, it's a way of rebelling against a larger consumer culture. you know where it's made, and you know what goes into making it.''  jean railla, the author of ''get crafty: hip home ec'' (broadway books, 2004) and founder of getcrafty.com, agreed: ''in a world of thousand-dollar 'it' bags, and hyperconsumerism, one of the most political things you can do is to make something yourself.''  her site, which went online in 1997, is largely credited with inspiring the movement that turned ''handmade'' into bohemian chic, and propelling a formerly fusty hobby into a $30 billion business.  the church of craft now has outposts in nine cities, and the museum of arts and design will most likely be overrun with its yarn-toting acolytes, primed for the idea that craft is the height of creativity.  still, sometimes a spool is just a spool. ''i think it's awesome that people are using needlecraft as a medium,'' ms. stoller said. ''it has a lot of associations, from the cheesy to the feminist. but i don't think every single scarf needs to be elevated to art.''

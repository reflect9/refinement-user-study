don't play it again   to the editor:  re ''the music is sweet, the words are true'' by dinitia smith [jan. 7]: i found the comment that good lyricists try to avoid near rhymes like ''home'' and ''alone'' very interesting. as a young songwriter in the '60s i was riding in a car on the san diego freeway with my friend and mentor johnny mercer. he turned on the radio, and we heard ''blues in the night.'' as frank sinatra sang: ''hear that lonesome whistle, blowin' 'cross the trestle,'' john turned off the radio and grimaced. he said that he couldn't believe he had rhymed ''trestle'' and ''whistle'' and that he was so embarrassed he couldn't listen to the song.  walter marks  manhattan  lyricists and their art

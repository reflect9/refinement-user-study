what wills meant   to the editor:  i am grateful for damon linker's generous and generally accurate review of my ''what paul meant'' (dec. 31).but he has no grounds for saying that i ''reject ... the early church councils, the church fathers and even, in many instances, the gospels themselves.'' i invoked the early creeds and councils as a basis for my faith in ''why i am a catholic,'' have written often of the church father augustine, and am now composing a book on the authenticity of the four gospels, a point that was implicit in my ''what jesus meant'' but whose reasons i am now explicitly expounding.  garry wills  evanston, ill.

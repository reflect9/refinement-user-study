somalia lifts ban on 3 radio stations   three radio stations were back on the air on tuesday after the transitional government, which took control of mogadishu, the capital, last month, lifted a brief media ban.  gen. mohammed warsame farah, the head of national security, said that as long as broadcasters did not carry antigovernment propaganda they would be allowed to operate.  ''they were releasing things that were not right,'' mr. farah said after a meeting with several broadcasters. ''everything is settled now. we will work together.''  in baidoa, the inland town where the transitional parliament still meets, prime minister ali mohammed gedi told lawmakers on tuesday that african peacekeepers, from nigeria, south africa, malawi and uganda, would arrive in two weeks, but only uganda has publicly committed to sending soldiers.

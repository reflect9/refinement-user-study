winning equals big money   to the sports editor:  re ''looks like a business; should be taxed like one,'' jan. 7: a successful football coach will generate far more revenue for a university than what appears in the athletic budget.  alumni are proud of a winner and, consequently, can become motivated to make generous donations after their team has won a conference championship or a bowl game. corporations want to be associated with winners and are much more likely to sponsor an academic program within a university whose football team has been successful.  as long as these are the facts, few universities will be willing to tolerate a losing coach, and many of them will offer outlandish salaries in an effort to hire one who will win.  jay dunn  hamilton township, n.j.  to the sports editor:  money from boosters or the national collegiate athletic association could be used for insurance policies for the players. if a player incurs a career-ending injury while serving a university, he could receive some kind of annuity that recognizes the sacrifice. figuring this out should be relatively easy for the insurance folks.  l. john miller  aurora, n.y.  to the sports editor:  the market set nick saban's price, and the university of alabama was willing to pay it. most of his salary is not derived from taxpayer money. a top-quality coach brings added value to the university. one must consider not only direct athletic department revenues, but also ancillary benefits. for example, a winning team benefits the university's student recruitment efforts by providing a tremendous amount of national publicity.  players should receive some compensation (beyond a free college education) for their contributions. that's the only thing wrong with this picture. and the n.c.a.a. is to blame.  sean michael  birmingham, ala.

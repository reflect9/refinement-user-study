art in review; john evans -- happy new year!   pavel zoubok gallery  533 west 23rd street, chelsea  through feb. 3  although known for a collage-a-day habit that began in 1964 and continued to the end of the millennium, john evans has made paintings intermittently since his days as a student at the art institute of chicago. this mini-survey of collages made from 1974 to 1987, all in the month of january, receives unexpected backup from five small, square canvases made in 1970, as well as a sixth, with color, from 1967.  the black-and-white works are especially noteworthy. painted on raw canvas entirely in black that is modulated into an impressive range of dark grays, they resemble velvety charcoal drawings, but their compositions are barbed. their claustrophobic patchworks of patterns and textures may bring to mind the flattened compositions of artists like joseph yoakum, roger brown and william copley.  they mix the geometric and the abstract with suggestions of cartoons, wood grain, textiles, caning and shag carpet. other motifs include part of a swastika (in ''swastika rising'') and a striped coffin (in ''smogscape''). part of their force comes from the way they suggest details of something much larger. they presage much about the recomplication of form that was to strike painting in the 1970s and should be included in the definitive history of the subject.  roberta smith

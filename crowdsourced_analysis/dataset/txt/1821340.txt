corrections   an obituary on dec. 26 about frank stanton, the former president of cbs, overstated his role in efforts to persuade congress to suspend an ''equal time'' law so that the 1960 presidential debates between john f. kennedy and richard m. nixon could be broadcast. spokesmen for nbc and abc testified in support of mr. stanton's effort; mr. stanton alone did not persuade congress to suspend the provision.

correction   because of an editing error, an article last sunday about complaints by upper west side residents that they cannot find superior bagels on west 72nd street referred incorrectly to the status of a bagel store on west 72nd between amsterdam and columbus avenues. the store, 72nd street bagel, is open for business -- not defunct.

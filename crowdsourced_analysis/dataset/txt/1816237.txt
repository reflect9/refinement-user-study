a bar stool that can disappear, inside or out   karim rashid's new magino bar stool and coffee table are both made of clear lucite acrylic, a material that fans of the designer's work have come to know well. (lucite is one of mr. rashid's favorite materials because it has ''a perceived lightness and clarity,'' he said, and ''an immateriality that disappears in any d√©cor.'') it is as strong as it is transparent -- the bar stool, for example, can hold up to 300 pounds.  both pieces are protected from ultraviolet rays so they can be used outdoors, and their curvy legs double as built-in storage compartments. the magino bar stool ($498) and coffee table ($698) are available at design within reach; (800) 944-2233 or www.dwr.com.  stephen milioti  currents: furniture

the onerous burden of property taxes   to the editor:  re ''new jersey's millstone'' (editorial, jan. 7):  you are correct in suggesting that middle-income new jersey homeowners use an inordinate amount of their income to pay their property taxes.  this is particularly onerous for many retirees who frequently pay some 20 percent of their pension and social security income for property taxes, yet on the block where they live, a wealthier person with the same property assessment may pay only 5 percent of his income for property taxes.  property taxes are regressive in that payments reflect property values rather than income, thus favoring the wealthy over the middle class and poor.  reform will not occur through plans to reduce benefits for state employees because the prospect of labor unrest and political retribution in an election year will surely deter legislators from provoking a significant part of the electorate.  the fair and appropriate way to achieve property tax reform is to require those with the highest incomes to pay a higher state income tax and use that money to substantially finance education while reducing property taxes.  jack isaacs  hackensack

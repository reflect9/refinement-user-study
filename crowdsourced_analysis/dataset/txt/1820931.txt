pap tests and annual exams   to the editor:  re: ''pap test, a mainstay against cervical cancer, may be fading'' (jan. 16): the development of hpv testing has undoubtedly played a huge role in the detection and treatment of cervical cancer. the advent of gardasil will decrease the incidence of this cancer. now more studies confirm the fact that women who have a negative test may need pap smears less frequently.  it is very important for women to realize that the pap smear is only a portion of the annual gynecologic examination. an annual (and for some patients semiannual) evaluation of a woman's thyroid, breasts and pelvic organs remains essential.  rebecca c. brightman, m.d.  new york

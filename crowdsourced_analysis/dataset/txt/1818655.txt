the week ahead: jan. 14 - 20; film   count this as retro noir week, as we do our best to ignore the golden globes. movie lovers have a rare opportunity to see ''il mafioso,'' a little-known italian movie that created a sensation when it was shown at the new york film festival last year. released in 1962, well before mario puzo and francis ford coppola put their stamp on the genre, the film stars alberto sordi (known from fellini films and many other movies) as a sicilian named antonio who has made good in milan. he goes home to sicily for a family reunion but finds that the old neighborhood is still mired in the culture of the mob, and that the ''capo di capi'' who made his legitimate life in a milan fiat plant possible has a favor to ask. and you know what kind of favor that will be. (it involves a gun.) the film is dark and funny and well worth the trip. it had only a limited release in the united states in the 1960s. opens friday, angelika film center, mercer and houston streets, greenwich village, (212) 995-2000; and lincoln plaza cinemas, 1886 broadway, between 62nd and 63rd streets, (212) 757-2280.  and the two boots pioneer theater is, for a week beginning jan. 24, showing another rarely seen gem, the 1949 thriller ''shockproof,'' directed by douglas sirk. a co-writer was the inimitable samuel fuller. in the film a probation officer played by cornel wilde takes into his charge a paroled she-killer played by mr. wilde's real wife, patricia knight. to keep her from a gangster boyfriend, he hides her at his blind mother's home; they end up on the run from the law, with the moralistic wilde character finding himself on the wrong side of right. the film is not available on dvd. (remember when they used to say, ''only in theaters''? it is.) 155 east third street, at avenue a, east village, (212) 591-0434.

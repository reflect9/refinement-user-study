corrections   an obituary on jan. 2 about sydney wooderson, a british runner who once held the world record for the mile, misstated the name of the federation that did not recognize a 1938 record for the 4:04.4 mile set by glenn cunningham at dartmouth. it was the international amateur athletic federation, not athletics.  the obituary also referred incompletely to the reasons given by the federation for rejecting the record. it did not recognize any indoor records until 1987, and it has never recognized indoor records set on tracks with laps longer than 220 yards; the dartmouth track was 264 yards a lap. (as the obituary noted, the federation also rejected the record because cunningham used four different quarter milers to pace him.)

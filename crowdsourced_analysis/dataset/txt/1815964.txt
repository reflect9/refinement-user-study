self-exams and breast cancer   to the editor:  re ''self-exams are pass√©? believers beg to differ'' (dec. 26): this reader does ''beg to differ.'' i am a 51-year-old woman who discovered a lump through breast self-exam in august 2006, two months after a negative mammogram.  after an ultrasound confirmed the existence of a lump (and another mammogram did not), a biopsy of the lump revealed breast cancer. i'm one of the lucky ones. because of my own vigilance, i am a stage 1, lymph-node-free, breast cancer patient in the midst of only four cycles of chemotherapy. they will be followed by a modest regimen of radiation and five years of tamoxifen and similar estrogen-blocking drugs, with a 93 percent likelihood that i will be recurrence-free for 10 years.  had i not practiced monthly b.s.e., at what stage would my cancer have been discovered, and what would have been my prognosis? i shudder to think. i will continue to plead with all women to be vigilant in caring for their health, including practicing monthly b.s.e.  lee ann russo  evanston, ill.

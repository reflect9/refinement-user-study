the week ahead: jan. 28 - feb. 3; film   you have only to see the 1970 film ''performance,'' featuring an androgynous mick jagger, his famous lips never riper for serious reddening, to see that donald cammell, who wrote it (with an uncredited anita pallenberg) and directed it with nicholas roeg, was one of british cinema's ranking madmen. in this stew of psychedelia and candlelit orientalia, james fox is a gangster who hides out in the lair of a faded rock star (mr. jagger) and two girlfriends (ms. pallenberg and michele breton), and they play at exchanging identities. metaphors abound in a film, probably best seen in an altered state, that today is regarded as a boundary-breaking masterpiece by some and an unwatchable mess by others.  ''performance'' is the most notorious of four films (plus one short) directed by mr. cammell to be shown in the film society of lincoln center's retrospective, ''the cinema of donald cammell,'' at the walter reade theater. mr. cammell, who committed suicide in 1996, directed one of the earliest techno-horror films, ''demon seed'' (1977), in which julie christie is impregnated by a giant computer. the visually stunning ''white of the eye'' (1987), filmed in the arizona desert, explores the consciousness of a woman (cathy moriarty) who awakens to the realization that her husband (david keith), with whom she is madly in love, is a serial killer.  mr. cammell's last film, the erotically charged ''wild side'' (1995), explores the relationship of a banker and part-time hooker (anne heche), a paranoid gangster (christopher walken, in one of his most outlandish performances), his wife (joan chen) and his thuggish chauffeur (steven bauer). the version being shown is the original cut, restored from the version butchered by cammell's production company and marketed as soft-core pornography. extreme is the word. friday through feb. 11, 165 west 65th street, lincoln center, (212) 496 3809, filmlinc.com.

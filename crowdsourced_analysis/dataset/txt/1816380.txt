world briefing | europe: france: bill to redress homelessness   prime minister dominique de villepin introduced legislation that would give the homeless an enforceable right to housing. the move was in response to a yearlong campaign on behalf of the homeless that included the distribution of tents for people living on the street. a concentration of the tents in the 10th arrondissement in paris brought the issue to a head, and on new year's eve, president jacques chirac promised to ask the government to work on legislation. the proposed law, mr. de villepin said, would ''put the right to housing on the same level as the right to medical care or education.''  craig s. smith

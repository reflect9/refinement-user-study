in cobo's basement, the china syndrome   introduced on monday: changfeng liebao cs7  is it real? since 1999, changfeng has been churning out mitsubishi-based s.u.v.'s and pickups for china and other markets, but not the united states, japan or europe. the cs7 is its latest concept s.u.v.  what's the point? to crush detroit's spirit and suck out its manufacturing soul. just kidding -- though automakers in detroit, europe and japan are tripping over themselves to strike partnerships with companies like changfeng to manufacture cars in china.  what they said: liebao means cheetah in chinese, and as the company's inspiring video noted, ''the cheetahs are leaping into the new century.'' li jianxin, the company's chairman, noted chanfeng's rapid 10-year transformation from a small military repair company to china's no. 1 seller of s.u.v.'s, with more than 23,000 sales in 2006.  what they didn't say: no word on when changfeng might cross the great wall between  it and buyers in the united states. company officials acknowledge the brand must overcome hurdles, including setting up a dealer network and meeting pollution and safety standards.  what makes it tick? a mitsubishi-derived 2-liter 114-horsepower engine delivers power to a four-wheel-drive system.  how much, how soon? liebao may sell a similar production model around 2008  in china, africa, south america and other markets, for roughly $15,000.  how's it look? sitting on the display stand in the cellar of cobo hall, it looked like a rejected kia design, circa 1995, rescued from a seoul wastebasket and smuggled to hunan.

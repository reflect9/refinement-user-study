our hometowns pay for charter schools   to the editor:  re ''legislature: learn to say no'' (editorial, dec. 31):  you suggest that removing the cap on the number of seats allowed for students in state charter schools would reduce neighborhood school costs for local taxpayers. this isn't necessarily true.  when students choose to go to state charter schools, their towns may suffer the loss of state education cost sharing grants for those students.  at the same time, the students' hometown school districts are responsible for the students' transportation to the charter schools and also some special education costs at the state schools. so there is a net loss to these children's hometown school budgets -- a shortfall that local taxpayers have to make up.  in stamford, for example, traditional public schools in the city lose roughly $90,000 in state e.c.s. aid and must pay an additional $350,000 for transportation and special education costs for state charter schools -- a net loss of $440,000. this must be borne by stamford taxpayers.  the state legislature needs to examine school financing in the 2007 session for all connecticut schools. in the 2006-7 school year, state e.c.s. grant aid for all schools went up less than 1 percent, while charter school financing went up about 48 percent.  john yrchik  executive director  connecticut education association  hartford

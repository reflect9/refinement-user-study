corrections   an article about san antonio last friday included outdated information about a barbecue stand in the city. the pig stand at 801 south presa street is no longer in business. the article also referred incorrectly to the san antonio river along the river walk. the bulk of the river walk follows the natural flow of the river, not a diverted section.

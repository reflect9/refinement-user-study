a democratic bangladesh   to the editor:  re ''earning a bad reputation'' (editorial, jan. 13):  you are right to insist that the united nations, the united states and the international community help bangladesh schedule a new and fair election soon. but both of the major political alliances will need to participate in restoring bangladeshis' confidence in their electoral system and preventing intimidation and violence against religious minorities and women.  democratic bangladesh could be a model in the muslim world. but extremists have already made inroads: the government that has ruled for the last five years has included a party that promotes an islamic state, and a surge in violence by religious extremists has raised fears.  the main opposition bloc has flirted with another religious party, which would demand legislation that would contravene basic human rights. courting extremists threatens bangladesh's democracy, with its roots in a constitution that protects basic rights, including religious freedom.  bangladesh must close the door to extremism if it is to shore up its faltering democracy.  felice d. gaer  new york, jan. 13, 2007  the writer is chairwoman of the u.s. commission on international religious freedom, a bipartisan, independent federal agency.

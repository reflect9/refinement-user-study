in reversal, toys ''r'' us to give 3 prizes for first baby in 2007   toys ''r'' us yesterday reversed its decision and awarded a $25,000 savings bond to a baby born on new year's day to parents who are not legal united states residents.  the company, and its babies ''r'' us division, said it was giving away not one but three prizes in the contest for the first baby born in 2007, including one to yuki lin, who arrived at midnight at new york downtown hospital in manhattan.  yuki had tied with two others: yadira esmeralda, born at southside hospital in bay shore, on long island; and jayden swain of gainesville, ga. yuki was chosen the winner by a drawing from all three names, then was disqualified because the rules excluded babies whose mothers are not legal residents. the prize was then awarded to jayden.  now all three babies will get $25,000 bonds. the original decision was reported in the world journal, a chinese-language newspaper.  the new york times reported on the controversy yesterday. later in the day, the company released a statement apologizing for the tumult.  ''we love all babies,'' the statement said. ''we deeply regret that this sweepstakes became a point of controversy. as a result, we have decided to award all three babies in the grand prize pool a $25,000 savings bond.''  yuki's parents -- han lin and yan zhu liu, both 22-year-old restaurant workers -- declined to be interviewed. but albert h. wang, a corporate lawyer who had mounted an e-mail campaign on the couple's behalf, said that they were happy, adding, ''i think justice has been done.''  some people were concerned that the parents' status had been exposed, he said. ''but the safest place is actually the eye of the storm,'' mr. wang said, ''and any politician who says we should deport the parents, it would be the end of their political career.''

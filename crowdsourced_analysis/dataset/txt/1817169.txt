battle lines in the fight to protect sunnyside   to the editor:  re ''brick houses, winding paths and unexpected sharp elbows'' (dec. 31):  sunnyside gardens is already a special planned community preservation district. this ensures the kinds of protections most people think of when they think of ''development'' and changes made to a residential community.  sunnyside gardens is currently protected against tear-downs, mcmansions, high rises, aluminum siding and so on. in fact, the proposed landmark designation would rescind the special district designation, which currently protects the ''open spaces'' and ''common gardens'' that many of us consider the real historic distinction of the neighborhood.  emphasizing bricks and mortar can come at the expense of economic and ethnic diversity, and neighborliness, which the original designers valued. thus the disagreements in the community are not between those who wish to protect the community and those who do not, but over what kinds of protections are needed and over the general character of the community in which we live.  warren lehrer  sunnyside, queens  the writer is the co-author of a book about new immigrants in queens.

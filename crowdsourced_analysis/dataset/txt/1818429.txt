new york judges' pay   to the editor:  your jan. 5 editorial about federal judicial salaries rightly faulted congress for the problem of lagging judicial pay, but it did not mention that the pay predicament for new york state judges is actually worse than for our federal colleagues.  your call for an immediate salary increase and for an end to linkage with legislative salaries applies with even greater force to our state judges.  while in the past, new york state judges have earned the same or more than federal judges, reflecting the reality that our dedicated judges handle a yearly caseload that exceeds that of the entire federal judiciary, today, even the highest paid new york trial judges earn nearly $30,000 less than their federal counterparts.  there has been no increase since 1999 -- the longest stretch without any salary adjustment in the entire country.  whether adjusted for regional cost of living or compared against other large states, new york's judicial compensation ranks near the bottom nationally. this is indeed a very serious issue, whether viewed as a matter of maintaining parity and equal respect with our federal counterparts or, more important, preserving the viability and independence of the new york state judiciary.  judith s. kaye  chief judge, new york state  new york, jan. 5, 2007

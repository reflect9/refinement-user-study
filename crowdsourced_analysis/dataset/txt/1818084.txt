corrections   an obituary on jan. 3 about teddy kollek, the former mayor of jerusalem, incorrectly rendered his birth name. he was theodor kollek, not theodor herzl kollek. (although he was named after theodor herzl, the founder of modern zionism, he was not given a middle name, according to the jerusalem foundation, which he founded.)

bears banking on the cold   some of the bears players grumbled this week about the fact that there were 6,000 empty seats at soldier field for their second-round playoff game sunday against the seattle seahawks.  they said they would prefer a louder crowd this sunday, when they play host to the new orleans saints in the national football conference championship game, but they would settle for a howling wind.  the game-day forecast calls for temperatures in the upper 20s, with snow flurries and winds of 10 to 15 miles an hour.  that qualifies as glorious weather for the bears.  it was 17 degrees the last time an n.f.c. title game was played at soldier field, on jan. 8, 1989. the bears were defeated by the san francisco 49ers, 28-3, but it was not the cold that psyched them out that day. it was 49ers quarterback joe montana.  to hear them talk, it can never get too cold in january for these bears. ''i would like for it to be 5 degrees,'' thomas jones, the team's leading rusher, said friday.  the coldest conditions the saints have endured this season came in their christmas eve game against the giants in east rutherford, n.j., where the temperature at kickoff was 52 degrees.  it was 32 degrees, with a wind chill of 22 degrees, at the start of the bears' game against seattle, which chicago won in overtime, 27-24.  ''what kind of weather would i like to see?'' bears coach lovie smith said.  ''we want chicago bear weather -- exactly what we're going to get. i think it's different playing here in the cold. the conditions don't really matter, but if we have to play we'd rather play in our conditions.''  karen crouse  n.f.l. roundup

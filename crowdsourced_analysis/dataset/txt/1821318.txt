stem cell research: when does life begin?   to the editor:  re ''a middle ground for stem cells,'' by yuval levin (op-ed, jan.19):  mr. levin, a former executive director of the president's council on bioethics, doesn't mention a critical fact: a great many embryos that could supply stem cells for research are left over from efforts at assisted reproduction.  these embryos will be destroyed in any case. the choice is whether their destruction will be in vain or will further human knowledge and, ultimately, human health and wellbeing.  cavin p. leeman, m.d.  new york, jan. 19, 2007  to the editor:  yuval levin's claim that ''human life begins when an embryo is created'' is a religious conviction, not, as he claims, a ''simple and uncontroversial biological fact.''  there is no consensus among biologists that a fertilized cell is alive in a sense that an unfertilized egg or unused sperm is not.  nor is there a consensus about whether a group of cells without even a rudimentary nervous system is in any sense human.  there are no compelling experimental data to decide the nebulous issue of when ''human'' life begins. mr. levin uses scientific terminology, but his assertions are scientifically meaningless.  john p. blass, m.d.  white plains, jan. 19, 2007  the writer is emeritus professor of neurology, neuroscience and medicine,weill cornell medical college.

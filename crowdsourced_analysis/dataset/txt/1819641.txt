lifestyle and body mass   to the editor:  while reading ''body mass and the student body'' (editorial, jan. 11), i thought about the many obese children i've seen in the company of obese adults. it would be too easy, however, to lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of the parents.  unfortunately, americans are embedded in a culture that promotes a toxic lifestyle: an abundance of cheap, unhealthy (and government-subsidized) food; fitness plans that are not well integrated into our daily lives; land use planning that privileges cars over pedestrians; and a work ethic that diminishes the importance of activities like sleep, slow meals and exercise.  the argument that we can choose to reject this lifestyle is of limited insight. why are people continually expected to swim against the tide?  karin j. lauria  marlborough, mass., jan. 11, 2007

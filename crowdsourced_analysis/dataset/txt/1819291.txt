the half-empty glass   to the editor:  re ''yet another worry for those who believe the glass is half-empty'' (jan. 9): so, a dutch study found pessimists were ''more likely to die of heart disease and other causes'' than optimists. and dr. richard a. friedman's essay -- understandably -- focused on whether pessimism triggered the higher mortality rate. but as a layperson i found myself wondering whether it would make more sense to simply relabel each participant in the study. i would dub them all realists.  jennifer lanthier  toronto

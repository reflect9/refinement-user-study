worried about jobs   to the editor:  re ''it's the year to keep an eye on paychecks'' (economix column, business day, jan. 3):  we're the writer and editor of newsweek's 1996 ''corporate killers'' cover story that david leonhardt criticized.  that story wasn't ''alarmist.'' it sought to explain why -- like today -- many people are feeling insecure about their jobs despite a strong economy.  a major reason, we said, was that chief executives were cutting workers right and left to suck up to wall street, then rewarding themselves and gloating over the fallen.  that thesis proved correct.  if mr. leonhardt was looking for alarmist stories, he could have found some in the times's ''downsizing of america'' series, which ran a month after our story did.  allan sloan  hank gilman  new york, jan. 3, 2007  the writers are, respectively, wall street editor of newsweek and deputy managing editor of fortune magazine.

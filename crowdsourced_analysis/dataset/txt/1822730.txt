mexican hot chocolate, now that the cold has come   in mexico, the traditional way of making hot chocolate involves using folkloric equipment to produce a steaming drink capped by delicious froth. this bit of culinary performance art will be done at tableside starting tomorrow at zócalo, 174 east 82nd street; (212) 717-7772.  solid chocolate is broken up into a tall earthenware or ceramic pot of boiling water and beaten with an intricately carved wooden implement called a molinillo, which is twirled between the hands. it is possibly the world's earliest hand-held blender. the result is often thicker yet lighter-tasting than standard hot chocolate, and when it's made with genuine mexican chocolate tablets, it will have a soupçon of cinnamon.  the hot chocolate is $6 or $10 for one spiked with tequila at the restaurant. mexican chocolate tablets ($4.20 to $10) and molinillos ($5.95) are sold at kitchen market, 218 eighth avenue (21st street); (888) 468-4433 or kitchenmarket.com.  food stuff

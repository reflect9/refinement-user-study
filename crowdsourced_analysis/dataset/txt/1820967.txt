metro briefing | new york: manhattan: call for aid to 9/11 workers   senators hillary rodham clinton and charles e. schumer and representatives carolyn b. maloney, jerrold l. nadler and vito j. fossella held a news conference at ground zero yesterday to urge president bush to provide money for monitoring and treating rescue workers, volunteers and firefighters who became ill after helping with the 9/11 cleanup and recovery. ''this is an issue that demands attention from the president and the congress,'' mrs. clinton said, adding, ''i believe this is a moral responsibility.'' last month, officials warned that federal money set aside for treating the workers would run out in a few months. to draw attention to the issue, several of the lawmakers said they had invited 9/11 first responders and some of their relatives as their guests for the president's state of the union address tonight.  sewell chan

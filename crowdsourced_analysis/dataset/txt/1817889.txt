the real thing   to the editor:  it is frustrating for producers who really are small, family, organic or sustainable to have their niche taken over by well-dressed fakers. i have a simple solution for your readers: call the company. if the guy whose name is on the label answers the phone, you've got the real mccoy.  we produce alderspring ranch organic grass-fed beef, and if you call us, you get us, or one of our kids, or the answering machine (the last the most likely, but we will call people back)! with a little legwork and investigation, people could buy the real thing rather than feel vaguely bamboozled as they leave the store. there's a lot of us out there: we're just a little harder to find than the store on the corner.  caryl elzinga  may, idaho  the writer is an owner of alderspring ranch.

the week ahead: jan. 21 - 27; film   this time of the movie year often feels as empty as a gymnasium after the prom. the studios have released all their holiday blowouts and award hopefuls, some of which are actually worth seeing. (and if you haven't seen ''children of men'' yet, what are you waiting for?) for the most part the industry is just holding its collective breath until the end of february, when the academy awards roll around, which is why disposable flicks like ''night at the museum'' are topping the box office charts. new yorkers, however, don't need to watch ben stiller run around a computer-generated fantasy if they don't want to, because this week the art-house cup runneth over with a trove of new and old alternatives.  the museum of modern art has the restored print of david lynch's primal dream, ''eraserhead'' (1977), a film that needs revisiting particularly in the wake of his ''inland empire.'' mr. lynch's latest freakout is still drawing audiences to the ifc center, which, starting wednesday, will be playing two of the most critically beloved and underseen films released last year, hou hsiao-hsien's ''three times'' and cristi puiu's ''death of mr. lazarescu.'' museum of modern art, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; ifc center, 323 avenue of the americas at west third street, greenwich village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com.

the viennese way   to the editor:  your report about europe's effort to curb automobile use (''car boom puts europe on road to a smoggy future,'' news article, jan. 7) did not mention a very clever technique used in vienna to keep cars from the city center.  a few years ago the viennese set up a system of one-way streets designed to guide entering cars immediately out of the center. only the very experienced (usually taxi drivers) can navigate the streets without being sent right out of the center district, and even they pay the price of an unusually circuitous route to their destination. in effect, most drivers do not drive in this city-center district.  when driving a car becomes far less time-efficient than public transportation, natural selection -- without punitive financial penalties -- is an effective and kinder way to solve the inner-city pollution problem.  alfred s. posamentier  river vale, n.j., jan. 7, 2007

corrections   a music review on saturday about bob seger, at madison square garden, misstated the title of a chuck berry song he performed and its release date. although the song is listed on a seger album as ''c'est la vie,'' and that title was on the set list for the performance, the song is ''you never can tell.'' it is from 1964, not the 1950s.

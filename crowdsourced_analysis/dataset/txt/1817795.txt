kurdish prisons   to the editor:  i strongly object to ''hundreds disappear into the black hole of the kurdish prison system in iraq'' (news article, dec. 26).  the prisoners being held in these facilities are terrorists who have known affiliations with al qaeda, ansar al-islam and other groups committed to killing americans, kurds and iraqis.  the rule of law is what guides our treatment of prisoners, whatever their crimes. the article even notes that the international committee for the red cross regularly visits the inmates and is in contact with the kurdish authorities.  there is no ''intractable problem'' accompanying kurdish cooperation with the united states. the kurds have displayed a historic and unparalleled commitment to a democratic iraq. nowhere else in the middle east are americans received with more warmth and appreciation than in the kurdistan region.  the united states relationship with the kurds of iraq is a cornerstone for stability and democracy in iraq and throughout the middle east.  falah mustafa bakir  minister and director of office of foreign relations  kurdistan regional government  erbil, iraq, jan. 8, 2007

coil: a winter festival of theater, dance and performance   if you hurry, you could spend the evening with two gentlemen one rarely catches a glimpse of these days: elvis and jeremy wade, above. the king of rock 'n' roll -- or at least his likeness -- will appear in morgan thorson's ''faker,'' and mr. wade, who recently moved to germany from new york, will present his acclaimed work ''glory,'' and a new solo, ''feed.'' the works will be performed this evening as part of coil: a winter festival of theater, dance and performance, which runs through tuesday at performance space 122. though ms. thorson's wacky, powerful dance-theater vision features an elvis impersonator (suffering from an identity crisis, no less), mr. wade will be there in the flesh. especially in ''glory,'' which sets a naked man and woman against each other in a raw, desperate struggle. if that's not enough for you, today and sunday p.s. 122 is also reprising ''moopim'' by the israeli group leesaar the company. a violent, erotic exploration of human relationships, ''moopim'' had its premiere last fall at the theater. be there early, as admission is free, and seating is open. (through tuesday, performance space 122, 150 first avenue, at ninth street, east village, 212-477-5288, ps122.org; $15 and $10.)  claudia la rocco  the listings | jan. 19 - jan. 25

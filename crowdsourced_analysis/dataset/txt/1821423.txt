(ben brantley)  'a chorus line' if you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by bob avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). schoenfeld theater, 236 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  * 'the coast of utopia' the exhilarating first two installments of tom stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. jack o'brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes brian f. o'byrne, jennifer ehle, billy crudup and ethan hawke (2:45). vivian beaumont theater, 150 west 65th street, lincoln center, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  * 'company' fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of john doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of stephen sondheim and george furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated raul esparza. like mr. doyle's ''sweeney todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). barrymore theater, 243 west 47th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'the drowsy chaperone'  (tony awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) this small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. but in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. bob martin and sutton foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). marquis theater, 1535 broadway, at 45th street, (212) 307-4100. (brantley)  * 'grey gardens' christine ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called little edie beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. she and the wonderful mary louise wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''grey gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). walter kerr theater, 219 west 48th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  * 'the little dog laughed' the comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the american theater, has actually resurfaced on broadway with all its vital signs intact in douglas carter beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, hollywood style. with the wonderful julie white as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). cort theater, 138 west 48th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  'mary poppins' this handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the p. l. travers stories and the 1964 disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. ashley brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like joan crawford trying to be nice and sounds like dr. phil. directed by richard eyre and matthew bourne (2:30). new amsterdam theater, 214 west 42nd street, (212) 307-4747. (brantley)  'les misÉrables' this premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of victor hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. but its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). broadhurst theater, 235 west 44th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  * 'spring awakening' duncan sheik and steven sater's bold adaptation of the frank wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical broadway has seen in some time. set in 19th-century germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by michael mayer and inventive choreography by bill t. jones (2:00). eugene o'neill theater, 230 west 49th street, (212) 239-6200. (charles isherwood)  'tarzan'  this writhing green blob with music, adapted by disney theatrical productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. the soda-pop score is by phil collins (2:30). richard rodgers theater, 226 west 46th street, (212) 307-4747. (brantley)  'the vertical hour' david hare's soggy consideration of the anglo-american cultural divide stars julianne moore (representing the americans) and bill nighy (leading the british), directed by sam mendes. the yanks don't stand a chance. with his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, mr. nighy mops the floor with ms. moore. actually, he mops the floor with mr. hare's play (2:20). music box theater, 239 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200. (brantley)  off broadway  'as yet thou art young and rash' an abstract collage of shards of feeling built out of euripides' ''suppliant women,'' this meditation on grief and the death of children in senseless war offers plenty of parallels to current society without doing anything so obvious as explicitly referring to them. the five-member cast, led by three beautiful middle-aged women, is strong; the director, david herskovits, has helped them shape an evocative piece that might be too nonliteral for some tastes, but is both moving and distinctive (1:10). the ohio theater, 66 wooster street, soho, (212) 352-3101. (anne midgette)  'dutchman' a revival of the poet amiri baraka's screed on race and american values, 43 years after its greenwich village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a malcolm x speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. it shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). cherry lane theater, 38 commerce street, between barrow and bedford streets, west village (212) 239-6200. (ginia bellafante)  'gutenberg! the musical' a very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. the excellent duo jeremy shamos and christopher fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). the actors' playhouse, 100 seventh avenue south, at fourth street, greenwich village, (212) 239-6200. (jason zinoman)  'jacques brel is alive and well and living in paris' a powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director gordon greenberg. as in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). zipper theater, 336 west 37th street, (212) 239-6200.(isherwood)  'meet me in st. louis' this musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). irish repertory theater, 132 west 22nd street, chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (anita gates)  'no great society' the brainy experimentalists of elevator repair service provide a madcap and almost dreamlike re-enactment of a 1968 episode of william f. buckley's ''firing line,'' which features mr. buckley squaring off with jack kerouac (1:30). new york theater workshop, 79 east fourth street, east village, (212) 239-6200. (zinoman)  'the scene' theresa rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in manhattan. tony shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to patricia heaton's frazzled chat show booker. enter the femme fatale clea, played by the gifted anna camp, and goodbye, charlie (2:00). second stage theater, 307 west 43rd street, clinton, (212) 246-4422. (isherwood)  * 'toys in the attic' austin pendleton's fine revival of lillian hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. what good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) pearl theater, 80 st. marks place, east village, (212) 598-9802. (bellafante)  'victoria martin: math team queen' must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. the playwright, kathryn walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. she missed (2:00). the julia miles theater, 424 west 55th street, clinton, (212) 239-6200. (neil genzlinger)  * 'the voysey inheritance' david mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted harley granville barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of victorian finance. an excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). atlantic theater, 336 west 20th street, chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (isherwood)  'the women of trachis' in kate ryan's wonderfully perceptive adaptation, sophocles' rarely produced tragedy about the death of the hero heracles and his wife, deianira, has terrific contemporary traction. alice reagan's superbly cast and infectiously energetic production is fun, intelligent and eminently worth seeing. (1:00). the ohio theater, 66 wooster street, soho, (212) 352-3101. (jonathan kalb)  off off broadway  * 'the dirty talk' kevin cristaldi and sidney williams are just great in this two-hander by michael puzzo about strangers stranded in a hunting cabin. how they came to be there is hilariously doled out by mr. puzzo, along with some thoughts about identity, the internet and the liar in all of us. padraic lillis, the director, has the two actors in perfect sync (1:20). center stage, 41 west 21st street, chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (genzlinger)  't j and dave' the comics t. j. jagodowski and dave pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance (1:00). barrow street theater, 27 barrow street, west village, (212) 239-6200. (gates)  long-running shows  'altar boyz' this sweetly satirical show about a christian pop group made up of five potential teen people cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). new world stages, 340 west 50th street, clinton, (212) 239-6200. (isherwood)  'avenue q' r-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). golden theater, 252 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200.

(zinoman)  * 'the clean house' sarah ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in new york at last in a gorgeous production directed by bill rauch. blair brown and jill clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and vanessa aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). mitzi e. newhouse theater, 150 west 65th street, lincoln center, (212) 239-6200; closes on sunday.

(zinoman)  'invincible summer' the performance artist mike daisey's monologue is a showcase of facile observation. during his first summer in new york six years ago, he discovers that it's hot and that people are generally much nicer than their comportment on subways would lead you to believe (1:30). the public theater, 425 lafayette street, at astor place, east village, (212) 239-6200; closes on sunday. (bellafante)  'regrets only' old acquaintance comes under siege in paul rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. but no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that christine baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). city center stage i, 131 west 55th street, (212) 581-1212; closes on sunday. (brantley)  'two trains running'  directed by lou bellamy, a rough-edged revival of august wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for african-americans, set in a dying diner in pittsburgh in the late 1960s. the pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of mr. wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). signature theater at peter norton space, 555 west 42nd street, clinton, (212) 352-3101; closes on sunday. (brantley)  * 'the vietnamization of new jersey (an american tragedy)' a revival of christopher durang's satire of war, family life and bicentennial fever, on the 30th anniversary of its debut at the yale repertory theater, swishes along at the speed of a nascar race. blanche baker is a gem as an out-of-it 1970s matron who just can't dust off the eisenhower era. the beckett theater, on theater row, 410 west 42nd street, clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on sunday. (bellafante)  movies  ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have english subtitles. full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.  'alpha dog' (r, 117 minutes) based on a true southern california crime, nick cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. do you know where your children are? well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. oh, and committing murder. (manohla dargis)  'alone with her' (no rating, 79 minutes) in this voyeuristic thriller, a young man named doug (colin hanks) becomes smitten with a coffee shop waitress named amy (ana claudia talancón) and tries to insinuate himself into her life through high-tech means, videotaping her routines from afar, then bugging her apartment. in the end, though, the characters seem less archetypal than vague, and aside from its sophisticated presentation, the film doesn't differ all that much from its template -- the late 1980s/early '90s fill-in-the-blanks-from-hell movies that followed ''fatal attraction,'' many of whose elements are revived almost verbatim. (matt zoller seitz)  'arthur and the invisibles' (pg, 94 minutes) luc besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (freddie highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. lots of famous names (madonna, robert de niro, david bowie, snoop dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (neil genzlinger)  'babel' (r, 143 minutes, in english, spanish, japanese, berber, arabic and sign language) this hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. the themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. written by guillermo arriaga and directed by alejandro gonzalez iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. almost. (a. o. scott)  'blood diamond' (r, 138 minutes) the makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in africa, starring an excellent leonardo dicaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (dargis)  * 'children of men' (r, 100 minutes) the end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by alfonso cuarón about a nervously plausible future. based on the p. d. james book, the film stars an excellent clive owen and features equally sterling support from the actors michael caine, danny huston and chiwetel ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer emmanuel lubezki. (dargis)  * 'the departed' (r, 150 minutes) martin scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. based on the crackling hong kong thriller ''infernal affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from matt damon and leonardo dicaprio, and a showboating jack nicholson. (dargis)  'dreamgirls' (pg-13, 131 minutes) the broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by bill condon, ardently acted and sung by jamie foxx, eddie murphy, beyoncé knowles and (especially) jennifer hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (scott)  * 'god grew tired of us' (pg, 90 minutes) this sober, uplifting documentary, which won two major awards at last year's sundance film festival, follows the resettlement in the united states of three sudanese young men uprooted as children by the civil war. handsomely photographed, and inspirational but not cloyingly so, it is the rare contemporary documentary that doesn't leave a residue of cynicism and outrage. (stephen holden)  'the hitcher' (r, 90 minutes) like the 1986 cult favorite of the same title, this remake is a crash-and-burn action horror film with intellectual pretensions. the overachieving irish character actor sean bean plays the hitcher as a philosophical sadist, toying with people who didn't get the memo saying that god is dead, but the movie is too shallow to embellish that vision. the merger of mystical solemnity and chain-reaction slapstick suggests a road runner cartoon directed by john woo. (seitz)  'the italian' (pg-13, 99 minutes, in russian) this dark fairy tale from russia pulls you into a richly atmospheric, persuasively inhabited world teeming with young foundlings and pathos, and upended by one remarkable little boy. (dargis)  'the last king of scotland' (r, 121 minutes) kevin macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the ugandan dictator idi amin from inside the palace walls. forest whitaker plays the mad king, while james mcavoy plays the fool. (dargis)  * 'letters from iwo jima' (r, 141 minutes, in japanese) another masterwork from clint eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. ken watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of iwo jima. (scott)  * 'little children' (r, 130 minutes) todd field's adaptation of tom perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. kate winslet and patrick wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''madame bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (scott)  * 'little miss sunshine' (r, 101 minutes) a bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the american dream. the excellent cast includes greg kinnear, steve carell, toni collette, paul dano and that national treasure, alan arkin. (dargis)  * 'mafioso' (no rating, 99 minutes, in italian) this 1962 film, revived by rialto pictures, is a rambunctious, astonishing blend of farce, thriller and social satire. the director, alberto lattuada, follows an up-and-coming fiat manager (alberto sordi) on a visit from milan to his native village in sicily. his homecoming is full of surprises -- painful for him, altogether delightful for the audience. (scott)  'notes on a scandal' (r, 92 minutes) judi dench and cate blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. adapted by patrick marber from a novel by zoë heller and directed by richard eyre. (dargis)  * 'pan's labyrinth' (r, 119 minutes, in spanish) guillermo del toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-civil-war fascist spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. in either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (scott)  'the painted veil' (pg-13, 125 minutes) nicely directed by john curran, this version of the w. somerset maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with naomi watts and edward norton.

(smith)  * the met: 'one of a kind: the studio craft movement,' through sept. 3. focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. among its stars are a witty bust by the california funk ceramicist robert arneson (1920-92) portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker albrecht durer; and bonnie seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century british and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (grace glueck)  * museum of modern art: 'doug aitken: sleepwalkers,' through feb. 12. produced in concert with creative time inc., this monumental video projection, screened nightly (from 5 to 10) on three sides of the sleek exterior of the newly expanded museum of modern art, consists of short, silent and rather too glamorous meditations on the working nights of five emblematic new yorkers played somnolently by musicians and actors who include donald sutherland and tilda swinton. but mr. aitken's astute and restless cinematic ambition and commanding sense of scale are in full force, especially in the more abstract portions of the piece, resulting in a fitting ode to the city that never sleeps and that the camera has always loved. (212) 708-9400, daily. (smith)  whitney museum of american art: 'kiki smith: a gathering, 1980-2005,' through feb. 11. many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. and some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. the whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. but fanciful as it is, ms. smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. it wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. it is about life and death, the essential things. 945 madison avenue, at 75th street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (cotter)  galleries: chelsea  * robert irwin: 'who's afraid of red, yellow and blue 3' in the past, robert irwin has paid homage to joseph albers. now he makes a bow to a different kind of perceptual magician, barnett newman, turning newman's 1966-70 paintings titled ''who's afraid of red, yellow and blue'' into a kind of self-reflective architecture. optical illusionism has long been mr. irwin's calling card, but here he has achieved it by bare-bones means, offering quieting visual fare for an overstimulated world. pacewildenstein, 545 west 22nd street, (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com, through feb. 3 . (cotter)  * portia munson: green on the floor, all manner of discarded plastic objects and cheap toys coalesce into a dense scatter piece that commemorates the fall of nature, the rise of suburbia and the varied tonalities of indigenous if artificial green. on the walls, exquisite mille-fleur-like color photographs made on a scanner redirect set-up photography back toward the experimental nature prints and photogenic drawings of the 19th century. p.p.o.w., 555 west 25th street, (212) 647-1043, through feb. 3. (smith)  last chance  * bronx museum of the arts: 'tropicalia: a revolution in brazilian culture,' tropicalia, or tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. this show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like helio oiticica and lygia clark, the architect lina bo bardi, and musicians like gilberto gil and caetano veloso, it comes close. 1040 grand concourse, at 165th street, morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org; closes on sunday. (cotter)  brooklyn museum: 'tigers of wrath: watercolors by walton ford,' this show assembles more than 50 of mr. ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early '90s. they frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to. though they're wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. but this popular artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 eastern parkway, at prospect park, brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes on sunday. (benjamin genocchio)  * 'the constant possibility of erasure' organized by donna harkavy and gracie mansion, this excellent group show is at once witty and elegaic, exploring transience as an existential reality and as a conceptual ploy in late-20th-century art. robert rauschenberg's 1953 ''erased de kooning'' is an important reference point, present through mike bidlo's painstaking recreation. joseph beuys, gary simmons and christian xarec all have chalk pieces on blackboards, while allan kaprow preferred drawing, and simultaneously erasing, chalk pictures on the sidewalks or streets. joanne stamerra hendricks uses erasers as a medium, and jim dingilian uses smoke. dorsky gallery curatorial projects, 11-03 45th avenue, long island city, queens, (718) 937-6317; closes on monday. (cotter)  * 'the early work of william king' the spindly figure sculptures by william king that we know best have arms like i-beams, legs like stilts, and heads that are barely there. but his early work looks quite different, and that's the revelation of this absorbing show, assembled by the art critic sanford schwartz at alexandre gallery. much of the material is hand-size or toy-size and comes in a variety of forms and media, and most of it is being exhibited for the first time. alexandre gallery, 41 east 57th street, (212) 755-2828; closes tomorrow. (cotter)  * frick collection: 'masterpieces of european painting from the cleveland museum of art,' this exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. the 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like velázquez, caravaggio, el greco, turner and poussin, as well as annibale carracci, francisco de zurbarán and andrea del sarto. but the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. extending john berger's famous title, the show might be called ''ways of seeing paintings.'' 1 east 70th street, (212) 288-0700; closes on sunday. (smith)  the met: 'americans in paris: 1860-1900,' the americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the united states was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and france was a major source between the civil war and world war i. that's the story told in this exhibition that goes a little way toward reversing the fall season's trend of big, surveyish shows made up of splashy objects and bland ideas. in this case, the basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on sunday. (cotter)  * museum of modern art: 'manet and the execution of maximilian,' this gripping show reminds us of modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. and it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, edouard manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like lucifer. there's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the austrian archduke ferdinand maximilian in mexico in 1867. but it's enough. manet's images, surrounded by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying.

(cotter)  newark museum, the jewish museum: 'masters of american comics'  organized by the hammer museum and the museum of contemporary art in los angeles, where it made a splash, this show has come east, cut in size and split between the far-flung newark and jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. art spiegelman, one of the masters who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work. this was a pity, for the obvious reasons, and also because the jewish museum scrambled to fill the gap he left by appending a half-baked display of superhero comic artists. still, the show shouldn't be missed. it spotlights artists like chris ware and gary panter, amazing talents and endearing in the tradition of those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their roomswhen other kids wouldn't play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, ''i told you so.'' newark museum, 49 washington street, (973) 596-6550, newarkmuseum.org; and the jewish museum, 1109 fifth avenue, at 92nd street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org; closes on sunday. (kimmelman)  p.s. 1 contemporary art center: 'music is a better noise' an involvement of some sort with music is the main criterion for this disparate but engaging show. the artist-musicians on hand include jutta koether, the rapper rammellzee, don van vliet (a k a captain beefheart) and devendra banhart. chuck naney contributes a beautiful sound-light installation in the stairwell, and rodney graham tries his hand at music video. 22-25 jackson avenue, at 46th avenue, long island city, queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on monday. (smith)  rubin museum of art: 'i see no stranger: early sikh art and devotion,' sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of hindu ragas, muslim hymns, and punjabi folk tunes? this is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 west 17th street, flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; closes on monday. (cotter)  the whitney museum of american art: 'picasso and american art,' despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. picasso's ''woman in white,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between arshile gorky's ''artist and his mother'' and de kooning's ''standing man,'' terrific paintings too. we are meant to register the plain insinuation of picasso's neo-classicism, then move on. the show ends not with the lively question of picasso's impact on young artists today but with a virtual retrospective of the later, picasso-inspired works by jasper johns. in picture after picture, johns buries allusions to the great spaniard, aspiring presumably to picasso's own late meditations on velázquez. except that even when he was old and running out of steam, picasso still had joie de vivre. johns doesn't so much enthrone picasso as repeatedly entomb him; closes on sunday.

crime in new orleans   to the editor:  re ''taken by the tide,'' by billy sothern (op-ed, jan. 10):  as the mother of a son who lives and works in new orleans, i have been totally shaken by the recent surge of murders (six people killed in a recent 24-hour period) in that hurricane-ravaged city.  can the city -- or the federal government, for that matter -- afford not to step up the police force in light of this violence, before it's too late for more innocent victims? not to mention the effect this will have on tourism.  my condolences to the family of helen hill.  catherine haidorfer  new york, jan. 10, 2007

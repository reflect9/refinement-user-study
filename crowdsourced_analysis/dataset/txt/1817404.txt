for what it's worth   to the editor:  the departing salary of robert l. nardelli, the chairman and chief executive of home depot, cited in ''home depot board ousts chief, saying goodbye with big check'' (front page, jan. 4) -- a $210 million exit package -- is outrageous and obscene.  no one is worth that kind of money, dead or alive, except for albert einstein, who never made that much money in his lifetime.  robert ackerberg  massapequa, n.y., jan. 4, 2007

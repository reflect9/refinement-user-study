in tins, in cups, teas are in bloom   miriam novalle had to close her t salon on east 20th street last summer when the lease ran out, but that obviously did not discourage her.  she has replaced it with t salon & t emporium, a large showroom on the fourth floor at 134 west 26th street, top; ms. novalle is at left.  customers will find the same elaborate tea canisters and tea accessories and the more than 400 kinds of tea she sold before.  among them are a number of flower teas, above left, which burst into bloom in the teapot or a cup.  with the help of new investors, she has also opened t salon, which serves teas and tea-based snacks on the lower level of the sleekly modern t√© casan shoe store at 382 west broadway (spring street), above right.  ms. novalle plans to open another t salon in the chelsea market, 75 ninth avenue (15th street), in about eight weeks.  it will have tea for sale, a full bar for tea-based cocktails, snacks developed by allan susser of miami, and a machine that makes a satisfyingly frothy tea cappuccino at the touch of a button.  food stuff

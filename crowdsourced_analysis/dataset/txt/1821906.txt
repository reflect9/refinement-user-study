snowboarding overlooked   to the editor: regarding ''out of bounds, within limits'' by christopher solomon (jan. 14): i want to point out a constant oversight in the winter-sport travel category.  frequently, there is no mention of snowboarding. this article is a recent example. three entire pages are dedicated to skiing, but they do not acknowledge the presence of snowboarders or comment on how they respond to the conditions. an obscure telemark skier is referred to twice. this sport is practiced much more rarely than snowboarding.  please include snowboarding in your coverage of alpine sports. it would be appropriate and fair to write about this sport because of its prominence in the marketplace.  ted larkin  new york

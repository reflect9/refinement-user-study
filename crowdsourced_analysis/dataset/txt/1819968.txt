metro briefing | new york: albany: student lender investigated   the new york attorney general's office is looking into certain methods of student loan marketing by sallie mae, the nation's largest lender to students, the lender said yesterday. the company disclosed in a regulatory filing that attorney general andrew m. cuomo had requested information and documents relating to ''preferred lender lists'' used by colleges and universities. a spokesman for sallie mae, tom joyce, said the company was cooperating with the request. ''we are confident that once the attorney general's staff has reviewed our marketing practices,'' he said, ''they will agree that they are in the best interest of students and schools.'' some loan companies have criticized preferred-lender lists, contending that college officials steer students to particular lenders in exchange for payments or other benefits. the federal education department is also considering regulating the lists.  jonathan d. glater

'american speeches'   to the editor:  i am grateful to william f. buckley jr. for the kind attention he paid to the two volumes of ''american speeches'' i recently edited for the library of america (jan. 7). but i wanted to correct one misconception in his review. as is well known, the library of america does not allow introductions or lengthy editorial explanations in its books, believing the american people quite capable of reading their classic texts for themselves. still, it was exciting to see buckley calling for more academic interference in the political realm.  ted widmer  providence, r.i.

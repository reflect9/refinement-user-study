he's not out of cash, but is out of the club   on the very same day that he left home depot last week with an exit package worth at least $210 million, robert l. nardelli walked away from another prominent position -- without a cent.  while he was still home depot's chairman and chief executive, mr. nardelli volunteered as the chairman of a disaster-response task force at the business roundtable, a kind of club for corporate chieftains that lobbies for their interests.  last month, he met at the white house with michael chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, and other top government and military officials to discuss improved collaboration on disaster preparedness.  on tuesday, though, mr. nardelli had to quit the group. the business roundtable is only for sitting chief executives.  at least he is in good company. the roundtable's former chairman, hank mckinnell, had to quit last year after he was pushed out of pfizer, coincidentally with his own $200 million severance package.  eric dash  openers: suits

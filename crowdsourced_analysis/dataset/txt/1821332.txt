corrections   a front-page article on friday about criticism of mahmoud ahmadinejad, iran's president, by iranian religious authorities over his involvement in the country's nuclear program misstated the connection between ayatollah ali khamenei, the supreme leader, and jomhouri-eslami, a newspaper that has rebuked mr. ahmadinejad. (the error was repeated in an article about iran on tuesday.) ayatollah khamenei owned the newspaper until 1989, when he became supreme leader and transferred ownership to massih mohajeri, a conservative politician. however, the newspaper still reflects ayatollah khamenei's views.

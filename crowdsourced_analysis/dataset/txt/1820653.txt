a reporter and potential juror says she can be impartial, to a point   jury selection in the trial of i. lewis libby jr. -- who has been charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for his role related to the investigation of the outing of a c.i.a. operative -- has been taking far longer than expected. mainly that is because so many of the potential jurors have expressed strong negative feelings about the bush administration, the iraq war and vice president dick cheney, for whom mr. libby once served as chief of staff.  and then there is matter of the news media, which already finds itself in the spotlight because of mr. libby's conversations with reporters. one potential juror identified herself as an arts reporter for the washington post (reporters covering the trial agreed to keep the jurors' names private).  she told the judge, reggie b. walton, that as a journalist, she would like to think that she could set aside her personal feelings and concentrate on the facts in the case, as a journalist should.  but with mr. cheney, she could not. she said he put his business interests ahead of those of the country. she said she did not trust him and would have a hard time believing anyone who was associated with him.  if that wasn't enough to disqualify her, she also said that she was not sure that she could resist yakking about the trial to her colleagues at the post or to her boyfriend, who is also a post reporter. ''i'm a gossip,'' she said. judge walton dismissed her.  neil lewis  media talk

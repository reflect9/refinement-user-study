critic's choice: new cds   mos def  ''true magic'' (geffen)  if you happen to get as far as ''fake bonanza,'' one of the last few tracks on mos def's third solo release, you'll hear this brooklyn rapper-turned-actor offer his appraisal of modern hip-hop: ''flossy and raw/so self-absorbed/immature /i can't remember being this bored.''  fair enough, except that boredom seems to guide this bleary hangover of an album. mos def may not be flossy or raw at this stage in his celebrated career, which is fine. but what he offers instead is lukewarm nostalgia and obligatory indignation. songs like ''thug is a drug,'' ''crime & medicine'' and ''murder of a teenage life'' carry urgent messages upfront, but not much depth within. mos def may care, and he may deliver tantalizing flashes of lyrical skill, but he doesn't inspire much feeling other than listless dread.  the music may be partly at fault. with production by preservation, minnesota and pharrell, ''true magic'' often sounds scraped together on the cheap. (the album's laughably bare-bones packaging reinforces this impression.) there are a few soulful moments, like the back-to-back tracks ''there is a way'' and ''sun, moon, stars,'' each featuring a blandly appealing singsong exhortation. but it's nowhere near enough.  and mos def seems to know it. he ends ''fake bonanza'' with a series of halfhearted mumbles that culminate in a defensive-sounding affirmation: ''it makes no difference what people say.'' then he punctuates that thought with what almost sounds like a yawn.  nate chinen

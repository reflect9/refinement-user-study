this lexus gets an f, and that's a good thing   introduced on monday: 2008 lexus is-f  is it real? oh, yes -- real enough to draw envious looks from the bmw m3 and the  audi rs4, high-performance sport sedans the lexus will compete against.  what's the point? the first car to wear lexus' new high-performance ''f'' designation, the is-f gets v-8 power and sharper handling in an effort to put the car on equal footing with european factory-tuner models.  what they said: ''we think the is was a really stout foundation, but it hasn't gotten the respect it could,'' said paul williamsen, production education manager of university of toyota, the company's dealer-training arm.  what they didn't say: the fastidious lexus has always erred on the side of caution. but enthusiasts can rejoice: the is will be among the first lexus models to allow the stability control system to be shut off completely for full-bore performance driving.  what makes it tick? a 5.0-liter v-8 with 400-plus horsepower and the world's first  eight-speed sport-shifting automatic will slingshot the is to 60 m.p.h. in less than five seconds, lexus says. the electric steering is retuned and the suspension is stiffened and lowered; this is features custom 19-inch bbs wheels, enormous six-piston front brake calipers and a quartet of stacked exhaust outlets.  how much, how soon? the is 350 can soar past $45,000 with options, so $55,000-$60,000 is a safe guess when the is-f hits showrooms next january.  how's it look? like a street-fighting japanese tuner. the show car features a delirious shade of blue that seemingly shouldn't survive outside a petri dish.

plush animals with a key to enter their web world   a stuffed animal doubles as the key to a web site with webkinz, a collectible toy that has been enjoying some playground buzz lately.  each of the 60 varieties of soft and squishy animals, sold either as webkinz ($14) or as smaller lil' kinz ($8), comes with a sealed tag with a code that can be entered at webkinz world (www.webkinz.com). once the code is recognized, children meet a virtual version of their pet that they can use to play games and chat with friends. the pet can move into its own furnished home.  the experience is a bit like one of the big online multiplayer games, minus the ability to chat freely. instead, you can send messages to other animals using phrases in pull-down menus, eliminating the possibility of contact with strangers. the web site has 20 games, including mazes, scavenger hunts and trivia questions (don't tell the children that a former teacher wrote the questions). high scores will earn you kinzcash, which can be used to buy more clothing or furniture for your pet's house. one stuffed animal entitles you to a year of online play time.  warren buckleitner  circuits

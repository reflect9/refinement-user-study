sad truth about ramen   to the editor:  lawrence downes's lyrical celebration of the late momofuku ando for his invention of mass-produced ramen noodles (appreciations, editorial, jan. 9) presents mr. ando's invention as the nutritional answer to a world of hungry, harried students and workers seeking a quick, cheap, easy-to-prepare instant meal.  but mr. downes's glorification of this humble product does not mention an essential point. ramen noodles by themselves, even with flavor packets, are almost devoid of nutritional value.  ramen has real nutritional value only when prepared with extras -- vegetables and protein that truly meet nutritional needs. but that would require the additional preparation the noodles were designed to circumvent.  daniel jacobson  new york, jan. 10, 2007  to the editor:  as some aficionados have discovered, ramen noodles can be rendered less slurpy by gently pounding the packet with a fist before opening it, just hard enough to break the brick into bite-sized pieces without tearing the cellophane.  charles h. bennett  croton-on-hudson, n.y.  jan. 10, 2007

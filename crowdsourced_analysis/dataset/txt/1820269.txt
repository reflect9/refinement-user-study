happiness 101   as a retired teacher of humanities and english, i thought at first that d. t. max's article (jan. 7) described a good way to help students connect with meaning and a desire to do good. but it's hard to see positive psychology as entirely worthwhile if it values happiness ''at the cost of a full understanding of literature and human complexity.''  nancy tilly  chapel hill, n.c.  mark linkins seems to be describing an established scientific or philosophical truth, as max quotes him: ''it's preferable to be happy than not, even if that means the potential for creative output is diminished.'' the logic in his astonishing assumption makes a compelling argument for lobotomies.  robert edwards  swarthmore, pa.

sticking with the majority   state senator joseph e. robach describes himself as a ''raging moderate'' and ''100 percent parochial.''  ''i'm looking to maximize for the people i represent,'' says mr. robach, 48, a republican from monroe county who was a democrat when he previously served as an assemblyman. these details are noticed now that republicans hold a slim 33-28 edge in the senate, pending a special election next month on long island.  so, senator, have you thought about switching back? what if democrats were to recapture the majority?  ''i'm very happy to be part of this majority,'' mr. robach said. ''i want to be in the position where i can daily highlight the needs of rochester, monroe county and upstate new york, but also get things done for them. as a member of the senate majority, i've been part of a team that has been able to do more for my district.''  as the man said, he likes to be in the majority.  danny hakim  the empire zone

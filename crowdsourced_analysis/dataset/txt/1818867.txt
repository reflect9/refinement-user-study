supportive community at an east side s.r.o.   to the editor:  as a longtime board member of the neighborhood coalition for shelter, i was distressed by the impression given in ''a one-room christmas,'' by saki knafo (dec. 24).  having just volunteered there this christmas, i can assure your readers that the residents of 211 east 81st street are not alone -- on christmas or any other day.  they are, in fact, supported by friendly and caring staff and volunteers, much individual attention and a wide array of services, including counseling, job assistance, education, g.e.d. training and recreation.  this christmas many residents gathered for caroling, celebrating, opening presents and a bountiful dinner in a warm environment. one woman was especially pleased that she received the gift she hoped for -- membership in the american museum of natural history.  she and her fellow residents are part of a caring community that helped them have a merry christmas and enables them to lead more productive and fulfilling lives.  leslie gottlieb  upper east side

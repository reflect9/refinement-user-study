corrections   a report in the on baseball column on jan. 7 about gil meche and ron guidry, two pitchers from different eras but the same hometown, lafayette, la., misstated the team that signed meche to a five-year, $55 million contract this off-season. it is the kansas city royals, not the seattle mariners.

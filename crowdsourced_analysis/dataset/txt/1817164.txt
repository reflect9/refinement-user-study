cash isn't everything   after he was forced out of the sharper image, which he founded, richard thalheimer felt shortchanged with a mere $5.7 million. but he was not angry enough to swear off the company's eclectic merchandise -- especially life-size statues of hollywood characters.  mr. thalheimer, who resigned as chief executive last year, declared in a recent public filing that his severance of $1.8 million was less than he was entitled to. his lump-sum retirement pay of $3.9 million, while $2 million more than the company said he was entitled to, was too small by his accounting.  making matters worse, he had to pull $10,000 from his own pocket to pay for sculptures of superman and c3po, the robot from ''star wars,'' that had decorated his office and that he wanted to keep. still, he got them for half-price, a discount he will be entitled to for the rest of his life. that means he can buy a ''sopranos'' pinball machine for $2,500 or a darth vader helmet for just $500.  patrick mcgeehan  openers: suits

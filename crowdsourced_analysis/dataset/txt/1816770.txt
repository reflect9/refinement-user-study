corrections   an article and picture caption on dec. 27 about david a. paterson, the incoming lieutenant governor of new york, and his father, basil a. paterson, the democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 1970, referred incorrectly to the senior mr. paterson. he was the second black politician nominated for statewide office in new york, not the first. (edward r. dudley, nominated for attorney general at the democratic state convention in 1962, holds that distinction.)

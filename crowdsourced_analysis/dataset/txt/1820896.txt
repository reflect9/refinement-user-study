here, there and in iowa   one of the striking things about the 2008 presidential campaign is the number of stages it is being played on at once. take today in washington, for example, where things will be happening on two fronts. the afternoon brings a hearing of the senate armed services committee, a platform that could display the sharply contrasting views on iraq of senators john mccain, republican of arizona, and hillary rodham clinton, democrat of new york. the evening brings the president's state of the union address, which many democrats -- notably mrs. clinton -- view as providing an opportunity to tee off to advance their own presidential campaigns.  for the rest of the week, attention in the senate will be focused on resolutions critical of president bush's iraq policy, giving a platform to other presidential hopefuls, including senators barack obama of illinois, joseph r. biden of delaware, both democrats, and chuck hagel of nebraska, a republican who is considering running. antiwar activists are planning a big demonstration in washington on saturday, an event that could provide the candidates another gauge of public sentiment against the war.  but the action is not limited to washington. at week's end, mrs. clinton is making her first trip to iowa since creating her presidential exploratory committee; it seems fair to surmise that this will not be the kind of small living-room chats -- with 10 democrats and a local reporter or two -- that have put the state on the political map. halfway across the country, mrs. clinton's former and potential future political rival, former mayor rudolph w. giuliani of new york, will be competing for attention by heading for new hampshire, a trip that was planned before mrs. clinton decided to spend the same weekend in des moines.  adam nagourney  political action

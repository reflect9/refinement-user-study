metro briefing | new york: manhattan: power line proposal   elected officials from manhattan and the bronx urged consolidated edison yesterday to reconsider plans to install a 9.5-mile underground electric transmission line that would extend from yonkers, along riverdale avenue in the bronx, under the harlem river and into inwood, in northern manhattan. in a statement, the officials said the power line would ''have a severe negative impact on vital neighborhood services and residents' overall quality of life'' and identified an alternative route that they said would be less disruptive. michael s. clendenin, a con ed spokesman, said that the line was essential to expand the capacity of the networks serving the area and that the proposed route was the most feasible. the state public service commission is expected to decide the issue shortly.  sewell chan

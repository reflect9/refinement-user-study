a democrat challenges democrats   the only way new jersey can stabilize its highest-in-the-nation property taxes over the long run is for the democratic-controlled legislature to approve major spending cuts that many of the democrats' political allies do not like. that was the unstated premise of gov. jon corzine's state of the state message last week in which he made it clear said that he saw no alternative to making cuts that would inevitably outrage powerful groups.  for instance, mr. corzine said he would not approve a property tax credit -- something the democratic-controlled legislature wants -- unless the legislature also imposed a cap of about 4 percent on future property tax increases. teachers and public employees, who generally support democrats, oppose such an ironclad ceiling and so do many local officials and school administrators.  mr. corzine also said his administration would have to cut pension and health benefits for all public employees, including teachers. the powerful public employee and teacher unions can be expected to oppose such cuts. he raised the possibility of selling off major state assets, including the new jersey turnpike, in an effort to pay down the state's huge debt, even though many good government forces take a dim view of such a sale.  and he called for creation of a state comptroller's office to audit state spending, for a new formula for apportioning school aid, and for voluntary consolidation of school districts and municipalities. these proposals, too, will face formidable opposition from groups that normally back democrats.  because of high public expectations, most democratic legislators believe they have no alternative but to pass property tax reform. but that will also mean standing up to their own supporters.  new jersey

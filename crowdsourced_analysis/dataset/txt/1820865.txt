veteran of lebanon campaigns is set to lead israeli army   a former infantry officer who commanded israeli troops against hezbollah in southern lebanon for many years was appointed monday as the israeli military's new chief of staff.  gabi ashkenazi, 52, a former general and currently the director general of the defense ministry, was chosen to replace lt. gen. dan halutz, who resigned last week after heavy criticism of his handling of the war in lebanon last summer.  prime minister ehud olmert and defense minister amir peretz agreed on the appointment at a meeting on monday evening, the prime minister's office said. the nomination must still be approved by the cabinet and a government committee.  in a country where security is the paramount issue, the army chief is one of the country's most important and closely scrutinized positions. a vast majority of israelis were disappointed with the inconclusive outcome of the one-month war last year with hezbollah, the radical islamic group.  since then, the israeli news media have engaged in almost daily speculation over possible shake-ups in the military. two senior officers resigned before general halutz announced last week that he also was stepping down.  mr. olmert has also faced intense criticism and has seen his poll ratings crash. in addition, mr. peretz has come under pressure to resign, but insists that he will not.  the prime minister has appointed a committee to examine how the war was handled. in response to a petition by a private group, the high court of justice on monday ordered mr. olmert's government to explain why appointing a new chief of staff should not be delayed until the committee presents its report. but the nomination indicated that mr. olmert plans to press ahead.  general ashkenazi began his military service in 1972. last july, he was appointed the defense ministry's director general.

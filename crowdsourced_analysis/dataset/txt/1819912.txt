living here | pied-Ã -terres; small but sufficient   who -- wyndi gundrum-cooper, 47, a real estate agent from ocean isle beach, n.c.  what -- studio condominium  where -- charleston, s.c.  i've been visiting charleston for 15 years, i even honeymooned here, and it's a place where i've always wanted to own a home. i looked for years, but of course the closer i got to the city center, the higher the cost. i discovered this little gem about a year ago. it's 320 square feet with a 100-square-foot courtyard. when i bought it, it needed work. i redid the bathroom, since the only thing holding it up was the tile, and turned the full kitchen into a kitchenette.  the biggest thing in the apartment is the fireplace. it's 84 inches, while the kitchenette is only 54 inches across. but a big fireplace is part of the historic nature of this 200-year-old building. it's only two rooms but proved to be the hardest two rooms i've ever had to decorate. though it's the smallest unit in the building, i wouldn't think about giving up my courtyard for a bigger space.  i live at the beach, so when i want to get away, i come here. we're two and a half hours away and make it here about twice a month. generally my husband, ron cooper, and i will arrive late on a friday night. we park the car out front and don't move it again until we leave at the end of the weekend. the condo is right on queen street, so we can walk to shopping on king street and to restaurants. charleston has a growing gallery district, and we are right in the heart of it. but when i first arrive, i just love to spend time in our home.  i never say i have a place in charleston. i don't want people to think that i have a mansion in the city or one of the newer, grand apartments, so instead, i always say that i have ''a space'' in charleston.  as told to amy gunderson  information on properties were supplied by the owners or the listing companies  where -- san francisco  what -- 1-bedroom condominium  how much -- $549,000  built in 2001, this pacific heights condo is 500 square feet and has brazilian cherry wood floors, cherry cabinets and built-in bookcases that separate the living area from the open bedroom. there are stainless-steel appliances, granite counters, a washer and dryer, one bathroom and one parking space. the building is a long walk or a short drive from the fisherman's wharf area. monthly fees are $481. agents: kevin kearney and brendon kearney, coldwell banker northern california, (415) 338-0209;

in the mkr, just a hint of lincoln's past   introduced on sunday: lincoln mkr design study  is it real?: this car isn't, but its design themes and powertrains are  destined for future lincolns.  what's the point? lincoln has fallen desperately behind the luxury leaders,  and this dramatic chrome-face concept shows lincoln reasserting its american roots.  what they said: ''we're referring to the past without repeating it,'' peter horbury, ford's director of design for the americas, said.  what they didn't say: in following the lead of the mercedes-benz cls by styling a four-door sedan to look like a sexy coupe, lincoln is also distancing itself from retro designs that lacked new ideas.  what makes it tick? behind its grinning mug -- a nod to the '41 lincoln continental cabriolet -- there's a 415-horsepower 3.5-liter v-6 with direct fuel injection and two turbochargers. the engine is e85 ethanol-ready, and ford claims better fuel economy than a comparably powerful v-8.  how much, how soon?: the engine is part of a new ''twinforce'' family that should begin powering ford and lincoln models by about 2009.  how's it look?: a shot of design adrenaline that -- if actually administered  to showroom models -- could wake lincoln from its long coma.

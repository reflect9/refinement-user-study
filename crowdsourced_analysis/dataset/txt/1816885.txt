why we travel | moscow   jean-louis droz, 52, human resources consultant from paris: ''it's like a dream because it's so unusual. red square is usually associated with something quite severe and official. i came here when i was a student. i was 22, or 21. it was about 30 years ago. i must say it was a quite different atmosphere. before, there were places for entertainment, which were rather secret. for foreigners, it was difficult to even have an idea of it. the only face that was visible was the official one. russia is often giving the image of a country that is very tough and sometimes a bit aggressive, but i think the real spirit of russia is so friendly and so hospitable. i feel something like that here.''  as told to sophia kishkovsky

metro briefing | new york: albany: brodsky makes ethics pledge   assemblyman richard l. brodsky told lawmakers yesterday that if he was chosen as the next state comptroller, he would issue an order prohibiting people and businesses who do business with the state pension fund from making political contributions to candidates for comptroller. mr. brodsky, a westchester democrat, is one of several assemblymen vying to succeed alan g. hevesi, who resigned last month. mr. hevesi and other past comptrollers took large donations from people and businesses who earned big fees from the pension funds. another candidate, assemblyman joseph d. morelle, resigned as chairman of the monroe county democratic committee to focus on the race, which will be decided by the legislature after a panel screens the applicants.  michael cooper

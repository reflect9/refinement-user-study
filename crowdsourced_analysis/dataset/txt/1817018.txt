new nicknames, all to replace nutmegger   it turns out that many connecticut residents find nutmegger as troubling as i do.  last month i wrote a column complaining about the term, an insult from colonial days about cheating in the marketplace that is still used to describe people from connecticut. so i asked readers to come up with alternatives.  they had plenty of ideas. yankees got the most votes, but i doubt if they were from red sox fans. people suggested constitutioner and charter oakers (constitution state is on our license plates), whalers after the state animal, and sounders and sound bounders because of long island sound. people played off the state's mouthful-of-a-name with little success, coming up with connectors, connecters, connecticors, connecticutian and connecticites. an episcopal priest in torrington made a list that included almost two dozen names, including connectiquichans, connecticuterai and connecticuphiles.  another writer's connecticutlets was clever, as was connecticats. ''easy to pronounce, reflects intelligence and self-sufficiency,'' the anonymous e-mail writer said.  john mucci of wilton said that to help pronounce a new suffix, we just need to turn the final ''c'' in connecticut to a ''k,'' to emphasize the hard-c sound, as in connectikite. and because we slur over the second ''c'' anyway, we should just drop it. more important, he said, ''being practical new englanders, we have never acquiesced to being called anything by outsiders.''  which may be the perfect way to look at this. ''you talking to me?'' in our best menacing de niro could be the best defense to being called a nutmegger. we shouldn't stand for the insult.  my pastor stopped me before church the day the column ran and said he would let me know when he came up with the perfect name. if it's a good one, i hope he announces it from the pulpit. but he had better hurry before fights break out.

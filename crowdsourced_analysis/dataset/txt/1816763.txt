corrections   a picture caption in business day yesterday about a decision by the mccormick tribune foundation, a large shareholder in the tribune company, to hire the blackstone group as an adviser while the tribune is up for sale, misstated the role of the company's chief executive, dennis fitzsimons, in the sales process. mr. fitzsimons, who is also chairman of the foundation's board, has recused himself from issues regarding the sale; he is not a member of the special committee dealing with the blackstone group.

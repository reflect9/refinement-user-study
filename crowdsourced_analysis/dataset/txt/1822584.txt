national primary needed   to the editor:  re ''big states push for earlier vote scrambles race'' (front page, jan. 25):  watching the states scramble to set new primary dates just reinforces how absurd the current system is.  rather than placing the choice of the party nominees in the hands of a few select states, we should institute a national primary day that would allow the citizens of all 50 states to have a voice in the selection process.  andrea b. hale  new york, jan. 25, 2007

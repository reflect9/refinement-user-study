corrections   an article in the arts on jan. 13 about the writer harold l. humes misstated the time frame during which he served as campaign manager for norman mailer. he was the manager for mr. mailer's aborted campaign for mayor of new york in the early 1960s, not in 1969. (joe flaherty was the manager of the campaign in that year.)

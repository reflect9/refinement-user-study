louisville's petrino to leave for the n.f.l. and the falcons   when coach bobby petrino signed a 10-year contract extension last summer at louisville, he insisted that it include a million-dollar buyout as a sign of his commitment to the university.  at the news conference announcing his extension, petrino said that louisville was the place where he and his family wanted to be.  ''i want everyone to really believe it,'' petrino said in july.  but in what is becoming a familiar trend on the coaching carousel, it did not take long for him to have a change of heart. louisville announced last night that petrino was taking the head-coaching job with the atlanta falcons. he will replace jim mora, who was fired.  the louisville sports information director, kenny klein, said in a telephone interview last night that petrino informed the athletic director tom jurich and the cardinals team of his decision yesterday.  klein said that jurich typically did not put buyouts in contracts, but jurich did so at petrino's request. that was because until petrino, 45, declared his undying love for the university this summer, he had been regarded as a flirt in coaching circles.  russell to go -- after helping his team defeat notre dame in the sugar bowl, louisiana state quarterback jamarcus russell has apparently decided to skip his senior season and enter the n.f.l. draft.  l.s.u. has scheduled a news conference wednesday to announce russell's decision. russell, who is 6 feet 6 inches and 260 pounds, completed 21 of 34 passes for 332 yards, threw for 2 touchdowns and ran for another score in the tigers' 41-14 victory against the fighting irish.  college football: roundup

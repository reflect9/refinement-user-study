compassionate chic   to the editor:  re ''uncruel beauty'' (thursday styles, jan. 11), about vegan-friendly fashion: not only is it chic to wear fashion that has some conscience and imagination to it, but there also is a marvelous inner feeling of knowing that one is not using one's clothing to wage a war on nature.  some day it will be the ultimate in chic to be a compassionate consumer. those who continue to abuse every animal and natural resource for their own pleasures will come to represent the ugly.  kat mcafee  princeton, n.j., jan. 12, 2007

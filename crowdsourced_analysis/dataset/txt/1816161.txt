corrections   an art review in weekend on friday about four shows at the p.s. 1 contemporary art center in queens misstated the name of the artist who has a large embroidered silk screen in the ''gold standard'' show. he is kent henricksen, not kurt hendrickson.  the review also misidentified the country in which workers at a gold mine are shown in a short video by alfredo jaar called ''introduction to a distant world.'' it is brazil, not south africa.  it also misstated the year that neville wakefield, who put together the ''defamation of character'' show, became a curatorial adviser at p.s. 1. it was at the beginning of 2006, not the beginning of 2005.

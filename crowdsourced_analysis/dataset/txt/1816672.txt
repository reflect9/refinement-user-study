in upton sinclair's spirit   to the editor:  re ''100 years later, the food industry is still 'the jungle' '' (editorial observer, jan. 2):  i take issue with adam cohen's characterization of my book ''the death of common sense'' when he suggests that it argues ''that laws like a new york ordinance requiring restaurants to clean dishes in a way that kills salmonella are somehow an infringement on liberty.'' the book argues not against regulation but for more flexible regulation that allows the use of judgment by government officials.  far from being a tract for conservatives, the book was embraced by leaders of both parties, including vice president al gore in his reinventing government initiative. the book's call for effective regulation is entirely consistent with the spirit of upton sinclair.  philip k. howard  chairman, common good  new york, jan. 2, 2007

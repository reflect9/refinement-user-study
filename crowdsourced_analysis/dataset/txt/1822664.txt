corrections   an obituary on jan. 19 about ron carey, a comic actor, referred incorrectly to the character he played on the situation comedy ''barney miller.'' he was a uniformed policeman, not a ''plainclothes cop.'' the obituary also included an outdated title for a television show that mr. carey appeared on in 1969 and 1970. by that time, it was known as ''the ed sullivan show,'' not ''toast of the town.''

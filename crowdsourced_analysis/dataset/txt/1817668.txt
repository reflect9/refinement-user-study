corrections   a picture caption in the arts yesterday with an article about christopher wheeldon's new new york-based classical dance company and its possible impact on new york city ballet and american ballet theater referred imprecisely to the ballerina alexandra ansanelli, who was shown in a performance with city ballet. while she was with that company when the picture was taken, in 2002, she is now a member of the royal ballet in london.

now, for good measure, nonskid bottoms and a lid   there is a lot to like about this set of three clear plastic measuring cups from zyliss. they nest efficiently, their markings in ounces and liters are easy to read, their bases are nonskid and the whole set has a snap-on cover. the largest cup holds four cups or one liter. the other sizes are one and two cups. the lid keeps dust out and also simplifies the storage of batters, marinades and other mixtures.  the price, $19.99 for the set at gracious home stores, is modest enough.  food stuff

leaving the board   moguldom is not what it used to be. just ask jim clark, who ignited the dot-com boom by taking netscape public a decade ago.  he recently resigned from the board of shutterfly, the online photo processing service, saying that the sarbanes-oxley corporate-governance law had taken all the fun out of being a director. congress enacted the law and president bush signed it in 2002 in response to the enron, worldcom and other scandals.  mr. clark, who founded shutterfly and owned about 30 percent when it went public last september, complained in his resignation letter that he believed that the law forbids him to be chairman or to run any of the board's committees.  ''what's left,'' he added tartly, ''is liability and constraints on stock transactions, neither of which excite me.''  so mr. clark went home, taking some solace, one presumes, in his 292-foot yacht, athena, the world's largest three-masted schooner when it was launched in 2004.  elizabeth olson  openers: suits

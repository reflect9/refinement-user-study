editors' note   a front-page article on sunday reported on barack obama's years at harvard law school. it included a quotation from ron klain, former chief of staff to vice president al gore, who said that mr. obama's inclusive leadership style as president of the harvard law review would not be as effective in running a country.  the times later learned that mr. klain is an informal adviser to senator joseph r. biden jr., democrat of delaware, who is expected to announce on wednesday that he is running for president. mr. klain's affiliation with the biden campaign should have been disclosed in the article.  also, a picture caption with the continuation of the article misstated the timing of the photograph, taken in the apartment of one of mr. obama's friends. it was taken during the 1990 midterm elections, not during the 1990 election for the harvard law review.

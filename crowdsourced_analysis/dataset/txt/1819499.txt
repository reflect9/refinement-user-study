corrections   an article on jan. 6 about white house efforts to find a new chief counsel misstated the working status of laurence h. silberman of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, who was considered a contender for the job. on nov. 1, 2000, he took senior status, which allows a judge to continue to serve while handling fewer cases than a judge in active service; he has not retired. (president bush has since named fred f. fielding to be the white house counsel.)

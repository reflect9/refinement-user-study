love ya, really, from way over here   talk about phoning it in. president bush's opposition to abortion is well known, but every jan. 22, when opponents of abortion descend on washington to protest on the anniversary of the supreme court's decision in roe v. wade, the president manages to be out of town, addressing protesters by telephone, not in person.  over the years, calls have come from camp david, kansas, missouri, new mexico and west virginia. the exception was 2001, when the protest fell on mr. bush's first official workday as president. that year, he sent a statement, read by representative christopher h. smith, republican of new jersey.  yesterday found mr. bush again at camp david. he made the call at 12:07 p.m., and left for washington 12 minutes later.  sheryl gay stolberg  political action: protests

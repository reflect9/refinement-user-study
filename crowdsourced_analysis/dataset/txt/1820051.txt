advice for invaders   to the editor:  re ''aux barricades!,'' by maureen dowd (column, jan. 17):  it is extraordinary that the historian alistair horne, who should know better, chooses to describe france's 130-year occupation of algeria as ''the depressing problem of getting entangled in the muslim world.'' it is as if the algerians, with their long tentacles, reached out and ensnared the unsuspecting french.  in fact, france attacked and occupied algeria without cause and without provocation in 1830, and then enacted a colonial policy of extraordinary brutality. by 1954 the algerians had had enough.  here's a tip: if you don't want the depression that comes from entanglement with a muslim country, don't invade it.  molly greene  princeton, n.j., jan. 17, 2007

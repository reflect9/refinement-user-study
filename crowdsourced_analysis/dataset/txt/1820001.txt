pataki will soon lose state security detail   former gov. george e. pataki will soon give up the taxpayer-provided security detail he has enjoyed since leaving office at the end of last year, a spokesman said on friday.  ''governor pataki has requested the state police to begin the phaseout of his temporary security detail,'' said david m. catalfamo, the spokesman. ''the former governor has been consulting with private security firms to evaluate and meet his needs on a going forward basis.''  departing governors are rarely granted state security details. state police officials granted one to mr. pataki on a temporary basis last year after mr. pataki's staff asked them to evaluate whether he would continue to need protection after leaving office.  gov. eliot spitzer approved the arrangement, as did the state ethics commission, which had sharply criticized former state comptroller alan g. hevesi for his use of state employees as chauffeurs and aides to his wife.  the security detail for mr. pataki, who is considering a presidential run, cost at least $20,000 a week, though his aides did not release specific information on the number of troopers assigned to provide him protection, citing security concerns. only mr. pataki -- not his family -- was covered by the detail, and the arrangement was to be periodically reviewed by state police officials, who are responsible for providing protection to new york's governors.  mr. catalfamo said mr. pataki had decided to switch to a private security detail because ''he's returning to being a private citizen.'' the state police detail would be phased out gradually, he said, on whatever schedule state police officials deemed appropriate.  ''if there's something that they think needs attention, i am certain they will bring it to our attention,'' he said. ''in the meantime, the governor is going to make accommodations on his own.''

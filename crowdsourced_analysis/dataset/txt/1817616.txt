arts, briefly; ho-hum debuts for nbc   opposite postseason football on fox and a new episode of ''desperate housewives'' on abc, two reality shows on nbc made their debuts sunday to lukewarm ratings. according to nielsen's estimates, the sixth edition of the donald trump series, ''the apprentice,'' relocated from new york to los angeles, earned 9.1 million viewers from 9:30 to 11 p.m., about even with february's premiere of ''the apprentice 5.'' nbc fared slightly better earlier in the night, as its musical competition, ''grease: you're the one that i want,'' averaged 11.6 million viewers from 8 to 9:30. nbc ranked fourth for the night in total viewers, but third among adults 18 to 49. fox led over all, benefiting from an overrun of its afternoon coverage of the philadelphia eagles victory over the new york giants. abc was no. 2 for the night, winning the 8 and 9 p.m. hours with ''extreme makeover: home edition'' (13.4 million) and ''desperate housewives'' (18.6 million). cbs, which broadcast new episodes of ''cold case'' at 9 (14.1 million) and ''without a trace'' at 10 (14.2 million), finished the night in fourth among adults 18 to 49, but ahead of nbc in total viewers.  benjamin toff

to dream of april showers   the nylon tote by longchamp is known for transcending style tribes: you can see it slung low on a mom's shoulder, sunbathing with a coed or swinging down houston street on boys with black bangs.  no wonder then that the latest longchamp design -- a fitted trench coat in beige or black from the line's new ready-to-wear collection -- closes style gaps of its own. made from french-milled cotton, the trench's deep jagged collar is dangerous enough for hipsters and sexy enough for grownups. its no-fuss zippers soothe frenzied parents whose every car key and pacifier demands careful inventory.  the trench was also built to travel: its fabric is blissfully wrinkle-free. the new collection is to arrive at longchamp boutiques in early february, but the coat can be pre-ordered from the company's flagship store in soho ($1,155; 212-343-7444 to order).  faran alexis krentcil  pulse

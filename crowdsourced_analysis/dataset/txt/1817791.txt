free will (or is it?)   to the editor:  maureen dowd (''monkey on a tiger,'' column, jan. 6) should not be so ready to embrace science times's penchant for biological explanation of all manner of actions.  in this case, ms. dowd entertains the idea that ''genetic and political coding,'' rather than choice or free will, might account for the president's decisions regarding iraq. she thereby not only takes mr. bush off the hook for his disastrous decisions and policies, but also implies that her longstanding critiques of this president are merely predetermined by her genetic coding rather than arising from rational analysis.  of course, there is not much reason to publish this letter since its content is predetermined by my genetic coding -- unless i have the good fortune that ''the decider'' of letters to the editor is predetermined to accept it.  elliot turiel  berkeley, calif., jan. 6, 2007  the writer is a professor of education and psychology at the university of california at berkeley.

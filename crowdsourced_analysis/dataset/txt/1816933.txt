flighty beethoven, liberated monteverdi and brotherly bach   'renaud capuçon, gautier capuçon: inventions'  renaud capuçon, violinist; gautier capuçon, cellist; aude capuçon, pianist. virgin classics 332626 2; cd.  the capuçon siblings -- led by renaud, 30, a violinist, and gautier, 25, a cellist -- are a relatively recent but noteworthy addition to the current who's who in musical families. the brothers demonstrate their rich, powerful tone, fine ensemble playing and wide range of repertory on their new disc, ''inventions.''  it includes arrangements of some of bach's inventions and english and french suites by frederick neumann, which the capuçons play with flair, precision and minimal vibrato.  but the disc also includes intriguing pieces originally written for violin and cello. the jewish communist composer hanns eisler, a student of schoenberg, was an outcast in both nazi germany and mccarthy-era america. the capuçons play his rhythmically intense, dissonant duo for violin and cello, a gritty, ironic and passionate work written in 1924, with conviction.  the french composer karol beffa, 33, dedicated his enigmatic, melodic and melancholy ''masques i'' and ''masques ii'' to the capuçon brothers, who play it with introspection and dramatic vigor. sandwiched between the two ''masques'' are karl kraeuter's transcriptions of bartok's hungarian folk songs, a cheery respite from mr. beffa.  the jewish composer gideon klein completed his solemn and chromatic duo for cello and violin, which echoes berg and schoenberg, in 1939. the unfinished lento ends in midphrase: an eerie foreshadowing of klein's death in a concentration camp in 1945.  it is handy for any musical family to have a pianist in the ranks, and the capuçon brothers are joined by their sister, aude, for a flirtatious rendition of kreisler's ''marche miniature viennoise,'' which concludes the disc on a lighthearted note.  vivien schweitzer  classical recordings

moment of opportunity in somalia   thanks to an unusual and probably fleeting set of events, somalia has a chance to return to the community of law-abiding and legitimate states. for a country that dissolved years ago into chronic clan warfare and became a way station for international terrorists, that would be an enormous gain -- and an enormous gain for the rest of the world.  to make the most of this opportunity, washington needs to move quickly, along with arab and african leaders, to try to broker a political compromise between responsible leaders of the islamic courts union, which was evicted from power last month by the ethiopians, and the internationally endorsed transitional government installed in its place.  international peacekeepers will also be needed to replace the ethiopian force, which is already starting to head home. ethiopia, somalia's longtime regional rival, needs to complete that withdrawal quickly to avoid a violent nationalist backlash.  if the transitional government is to survive, it will have to strike a deal with moderate islamists. the person it needs to talk with is sheik sharif ahmed, who is no. 2 in the movement and by most accounts a reasonable man. he is currently in kenya after apparently getting an american guarantee that he would not be deported back to somalia.  the united nations, which helped create the transitional government, should take charge of organizing a peacekeeping force. the arab league (somalia is a member) and the african union (with headquarters in ethiopia) need to persuade all sides to come and stay at the table. unfortunately, none of these organizations are known for operating quickly. the bush administration needs to press them all to seize this moment. this sudden chance to make peace is not likely to last for long.  editorial

an east village bar and its neighbors   to the editor:  as a board member and resident of the building directly across the street from heathers bar (''the sound and the fury,'' jan. 21), i believe that the public opposition to the noise problem is legitimate and more than just an ''active minority'' of residents. my neighbors and i regularly endure noise and many other disturbances to our quality of life resulting from heathers.  although i live in the back of the building, i must now leave some of my windows closed at night year-round to avoid hearing the noise.  many residents of our building are suffering from the nightly commotion, even with windows closed. one unit-owner recently moved out, citing the disturbances from heathers, specifically, as the main reason for moving. for these reasons, i believe that the vast majority of the residents of our building and this block oppose the renewal of heathers' liquor license.  stephen cooper  east village  to the editor:  i am a designer and artist living on 13th street, two doors down from heathers. as a patron, i appreciate the gluten-free beer and potato vodka, but primarily it is the vibe that brings me back.  not since leaving the mission neighborhood of san francisco have i found a place that feels like a true community of locals, varied in interest, age, profession and gender. heathers is one of the few gems at night that reflects what the east village could be.  before heathers, the space was an after-hours club, and as a neighbor i much prefer heathers. as a patron i am glad it has withstood the complaints, and i hope that the two parties can resolve their issues.  cas holman  east village

breakfast without a battle   to the editor:  whatever happened to drinking some o.j. and eating a slice of whole-wheat toast or a bowl of whole-grain cereal before venturing out for coffee? (''the breakfast wars,'' jan. 10).  presumably we all know enough about the connection between diet and health to know that store-bought pastries and egg and cheese sandwiches are not the foundation of any healthy eating plan. more people are heavier than ever; type 2 diabetes is on the rise; diet books are best sellers.  the answer is simple. really. try eating at home. one could actually brew coffee at home, too, if needed. and sprinkle cinnamon on top.  ann calandro  flemington, n.j.

free content dominates video downloads   more than four times as many households downloaded videos from file-sharing networks as they did from centralized services like itunes in the third quarter of 2006.  downloads from file-sharing networks are generally free, and have long occurred outside the control of copyright holders. the cost of for-pay downloads, about 90 percent of which go through itunes, generally includes a licensing fee.  but not many of the freeloaders are actually downloading mainstream content, according to the new data on downloading, which was gathered by the npd group, a consumer-research firm, through tracking software installed in 12,500 households. only about 20 percent of the videos downloaded from file-sharing networks were tv shows, and 5 percent were mainstream movies, while just under 60 percent were pornographic movies.  the relative scarcity of pirated movie downloads may have more to do with legal and business pressure than with users' tastes. many file-sharing networks are struggling to find accommodation with the movie and recording industries; for example, bittorrent, a service whose software is on about 80 million computers, struck a deal in 2005 with the motion picture association of america to remove infringing content from the search index on its web site.  alex mindlin  drilling down

2 u.s. cities to vie in bid for games   the united states will bid to be the host country for the 2016 summer olympics in either los angeles or chicago, the united states olympic committee announced yesterday.  the u.s.o.c.'s directors will choose between the cities on april 14, after the two submit bid books and participate in site evaluation visits. the international olympic committee will choose the winning city in 2009, with bids expected from madrid, rio de janeiro, rome and tokyo, among others.  new york decided against another attempt after losing the 2012 race to london in a five-city race that became the olympics' most hotly contested bid.  that loss, when new york was knocked out in the second round of voting and finished behind madrid, paris and london, left the u.s.o.c. smarting from the lack of international backing. it has spent the past 18 months trying to shore up its support, bolstering its international relations team and asking i.o.c. members which cities would make good candidates.  ''based on our analysis, we believe the time is right for a u.s. city to bid, and we fully intend to proceed with a unified, national effort to bring the games back to america in 2016,'' the u.s.o.c. chairman, peter ueberroth, said.  until this point, the u.s.o.c.'s focus has been on the international aspects of the bids. the details will be pored over after the bid books have been submitted and an evaluation team visits each city in late february or early march.  new york's west side stadium debacle in 2005 led the u.s.o.c. to create a rule that any of its bid cities must have an existing or fully approved stadium.  los angeles is trying for its third olympics -- ueberroth led the organizing committee for the 1984 games there -- and chicago for its first. los angeles boasts the most facilities, many of which were used in the 1984 games, including the coliseum. chicago proposes more new development.

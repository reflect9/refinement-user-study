a plan for darfur   to the editor:  i was heartened by ''no sanctuary'' (editorial, dec. 23), in which you urge long-overdue action on sudan.  whether it's sending united nations peacekeepers into darfur; freezing the assets of all sudanese officials involved in the genocide; imposing a no-flight zone over darfur; or using all three measures, we can no longer remain innocent bystanders to genocide.

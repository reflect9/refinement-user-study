corrections   a front-page article yesterday about wiretapped conversations in the case against jose padilla, who is accused of plotting a ''dirty bomb'' attack, omitted two lines at the continuation in some copies. the sentence should have read: ''in the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, mr. padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.''

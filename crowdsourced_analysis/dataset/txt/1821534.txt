grading the principal   to the editor:  re ''overhaul of schools would let teachers rate principals'' (news article, jan. 19):  let me pretend that i am still an active high school principal. how would i feel about being rated by my teachers? pretty good, i think.  i rate teachers, so why can't they rate me? i might learn something from it.  of course, when i rated teachers i also gave suggestions for improvement. i hope they would do the same for me. some teachers may give me a negative rating, but i can live with that.  as herbert bayard swope famously said, ''i can't give you a sure-fire formula for success, but i can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.''  mayor michael r. bloomberg also wants to give me more authority, provided i can ''meet performance benchmarks.''  fine. let me choose my teachers and assistant principals, make assignments by merit and not seniority and offer rewards for excellent teaching, and i'm ready to go.  jack m. pollock  new york, jan. 19, 2007

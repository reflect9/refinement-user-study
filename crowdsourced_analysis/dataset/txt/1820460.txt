anonymous, but not quite   to the editor:  i enjoyed reading ''a one-room christmas,'' by saki knafo (dec. 24), but want to point out what seems to me like a grave mistake on his part when discussing the ''ex-convict from the south bronx.''  we read that this s.r.o. tenant would speak only if he was ''guaranteed anonymity, because he had angered some dangerous people during his drug-dealing days,'' and while mr. knafo doesn't specifically state this man's name, he does everything else except invite the reader to his one-room apartment for a dinner party.  he describes his unusual appearance when he was young and the nickname it provoked. anyone who knew him at the time would know who was being described. the article also describes how he looks now and gives the address of the s.r.o.  i understand that this man's story and the details included make the article more well drawn and interesting, but i think the inclusion of these details was a betrayal. i wonder how he feels about it.  jessica blank  park slope, brooklyn

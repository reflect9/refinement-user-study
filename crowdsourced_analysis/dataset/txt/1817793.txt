our civil liberties: congress must act   to the editor:  ''the imperial presidency 2.0'' (editorial, jan. 7) is right on target about urging the democrats and moderate republicans to re-amend the laws that congress rushed into being before the election of 2006.  as you say, this is ''not about the past.'' we need to stop the continuing assault that the bush administration has made on our civil liberties and constitutional principles; otherwise, we are down the road to our own demise as a democratic nation.  by not allowing detainees of any stripe the basic rights of arguing the basis of their detention; by allowing the president, at his discretion only, to look at first-class mail or e-mail or listen to phone conversations, we are opening the way toward unchecked presidential power that our constitution was deliberately designed to protect us from.  the president's use of ''signing statements'' extends his disregard for law. congress should pass a new law specifically forbidding this practice.  the road toward dictatorship is begun with just such small ''signing statements'' and similar emasculations of our civil liberties as outlined in your editorial.  deborah goodell  ridgewood, n.j., jan. 7, 2007

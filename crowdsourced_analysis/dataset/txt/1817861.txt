corrections   a front-page article on dec. 19, about the financial problems that health plans for retired government workers are causing in some cities, misstated the amount that new york city intends to set aside in a trust fund to pay for its retired workers' health care. it is $2 billion, which is to be paid over fiscal years 2006 and 2007 -- not $2.2 billion, which is the city's contribution to the trust fund in fiscal 2006 as well as its outlay for retiree health care in the same year.

correction   because of an editing error, an article last sunday about depictions of celebrity magazines in television series and novels referred incorrectly to absolute magazine, whose former editor in chief, andrew essex, discussed the portrayals. it is not exclusively for holders of american express black cards, known formally as the centurion card; absolute is aimed at affluent readers in general. (centurion, the magazine, is published exclusively for customers with black cards.)

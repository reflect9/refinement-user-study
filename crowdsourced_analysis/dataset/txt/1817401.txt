drug abuse and the teenager   to the editor:  among all the statistics that mike males cites in ''this is your brain on drugs, dad'' (op-ed, jan. 3), a crucial point is absent.  teenagers of the 1960s and 1970s did not have the benefit of the aggressive drug prevention and education efforts of the last two decades that have helped to drive down drug use.  research on drug trends is vital to uncover the attitudes that underlie drug using behaviors. it informs prevention efforts and the important work being done in the area of drug treatment and intervention.  the spread of methamphetamine in parts of our nation is wreaking havoc. the intentional abuse of prescription and over-the-counter medicines is a pervasive problem that has become a far too normal part of many teenagers' lives. these are dangerous behaviors that cause real damage. this hardly represents an ''obsession with hyping teenage drug use,'' but rather a reality check that cannot be ignored.  drug abuse overwhelmingly begins with youth, and when we successfully prevent teenagers from using drugs or tobacco, or abusing alcohol, they are far less likely to pick up the behavior later in life.  stephen j. pasierb  president and c.e.o., partnership  for a drug-free america  new york, jan. 3, 2007

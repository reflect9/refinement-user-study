benny parsons, 65, driver named one of nascar's best   benny parsons, a popular champion auto racer who became a home-spun analyst for nascar's nationally televised races, died yesterday in charlotte, n.c. he was 65 and lived in ellerbe, n.c.  the cause was complications of lung cancer, according to performance racing network, with which parsons had a weekly radio show. parsons learned he had cancer of the left lung in july and had been hospitalized in charlotte since dec. 26.  ''i smoked my last cigarette way back in 1978,'' he told nascar.com in july, ''and since then i've hated being around smoking.''  he continued to call races for nbc and tnt during his treatment.  nascar named parsons one of its 50 greatest drivers in 1998, its 50th anniversary. he was the only driver to have won season championships in both the automobile racing club of america (1968 and 1969), a midwestern stock-car circuit, and nascar's top circuit, the winston cup (1973), now the nextel cup. parsons won stock-car racing's two major races: the daytona 500 in daytona beach, fla., in 1975 and the world 600 in concord, n.c., in 1980.  ''it's been 18 years and i'm still introduced as the winner of the daytona 500,'' he told the richmond times-dispatch in 1993.  in 1982, he became the first driver to top 200 miles an hour in qualifying, winning the pole for a race in talladega, ala., at 200.176 m.p.h.  from 1964 to 1988, parsons drove in 526 nascar races, winning 21. he finished in the top five 199 times and the top 10 283 times. by his count, he raced 134,870 laps and earned $4,426,278 in an era in which prize money was much less than it is now.  money was scarce at the start.  ''in 1965, i think i had finished third in the a.r.c.a. 200,'' he told the daytona beach news journal. ''i really wanted to build on that, but i was broke. in 1965, my first son was born and somehow i had $75 to start him a bank account. about that time, the rear-end cooler pump broke on the car. a new one was $99.''  parsons raided his son's bank account, found $24 elsewhere, got the pump and went on to success.  he was still racing part time when he started his television career as a pit reporter. with a folksy manner, he went on to become an announcer and analyst for espn and tbs as well as for nbc and tnt. he won an emmy award with espn in 1996.  benny parsons was born july 21, 1941, in north wilkesboro, n.c. when he was 19, his family moved to detroit, where he worked for a gasoline station and taxi company owned by his father.  in 1997, he wrote on a web site about an incident two months after he arrived in detroit:  ''i met two guys my dad knew who had a racecar,'' he said. ''i started going to the track, into the pits. three years later, in 1963, one of these guys stopped by dad's station and asked me if i'd like to drive a car. i said i thought so. he said he had a car he'd give to me, a ford.  ''we went to his garage, and the first thought i had was that he had got cheated. it was torn all to pieces. we fixed it, though, and i ran my first race, a figure-8 feature on a quarter-mile dirt track, and spun out. twelve years later, i was the daytona 500 champion.''  parsons was elected to the international motorsports hall of fame in 1994 and the stock car racing hall of fame in 1998.  he is survived by his wife, terri; two sons, keith and kevin; a brother, phil; and two granddaughters.

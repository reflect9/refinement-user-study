safe as milk?   the food and drug administration's assessment that food from cloned animals is safe to eat is a victory for biotech companies and a loss for everyone else. like many decisions on the cutting edge of agricultural technology, it was hurried along in a way that is more sensitive to political and economic pressure than to the long-term welfare of animals, humans and the world they inhabit. asking whether cloned meat and milk are safe is not even the right question. the right question is, why clone at all?  approving food from cloned animals will create another food-labeling nightmare and the same aggressive litigation that usually blocks any attempt to tell consumers where their food comes from.  but cloning has much worse consequences. it marks a revolutionary shift -- from the relative randomness of sexual reproduction to the apparent uniformity of asexual reproduction. because cloning creates genetically identical animals, it will shrink the gene pool on which agriculture rests, and any drastic shrinkage in genetic diversity creates enormous health risks for a species.  cloning isn't just a matter for the f.d.a. to decide. it is up to us as a society to decide as well. we should be asking much broader questions than the f.d.a. is able to. who will cloning benefit? what will it do to the health of the animals themselves?  but the most important question of all may be this one: are we willing to judge the suitability of new technologies in ways that fully address their ethical and biological complexities? or are we doomed to give in to politics and the bottom line?  editorial

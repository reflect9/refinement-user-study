drunken driving in 'cheever country'   to the editor:  gerri hirshey's important column about the high incidence of drunken driving in connecticut (''one mother's sad mission, a state's shame,'' jan. 14) includes one curious reference. ms. hirshey asks how such a problem could have developed ''here in prosperous, educated cheever country?''  much as we would like to claim such a fine writer for the nutmeg state, john cheever was a massachusetts native who lived his adult life not in connecticut but in manhattan and suburban new york. what makes the reference even more curious is that alcohol flows in rivers through cheever's work. cheever himself struggled with drinking for most of his life and, according to a biographer, scott donaldson, was arrested on at least one occasion for driving while intoxicated.  how can alcohol bedevil even prosperous suburbs? for answers, one needs to look no farther than the tortured life and transcendent fiction of john cheever.  charles slack  trumbull

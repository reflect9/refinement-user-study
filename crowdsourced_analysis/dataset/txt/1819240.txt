money focus   the groups known as 527s spent more than $400 million on federal races in 2006, a big increase over the $258 million they spent in the 2002 midterm elections. but the total was less than half of the $947 million they raised for the 2004 presidential campaign, according to final figures from the center for responsive politics, a nonpartisan watchdog group.  the biggest players in 2006 were unions.  the biggest individual donor in 2006 was bob j. perry, a conservative texas homebuilder, who kicked in almost $10 million to use against democratic candidates for congress.  george soros, the billionaire financier, spent $3.4 million to help elect democrats in 2006; two years earlier, he gave $23.4 million in hope of defeating president bush.  john m. broder  political action

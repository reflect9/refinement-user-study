an electronic watchdog will follow you to a new home   those who rent their homes are just as vulnerable to burglars as homeowners, but they are less likely to have burglar alarms. and who can blame them? what renter wants to pay to install a system that has to be left behind in a move, or be locked into a monitoring company's contract that is longer than the lease?  into the breach comes lasershield, a portable burglar alarm system available at compusa, costco and kmart stores.  the $200 starter kit comes with a master alarm unit, a wireless detection unit and two keychain remotes. the detection unit can monitor rooms of up to 1,200 square feet. as many as 11 additional wireless units can be added to a system, costing mansion renters an extra $60 each.  when a motion detector's infrared beam is broken it signals the master alarm unit, which can be placed up to 150 feet away. the system lets out a 105-decibel siren and calls a monitoring service. the monitoring service charges a monthly fee of $20, after a $25 activation charge. the master unit and detectors have backup batteries that last for 12 hours, and they are easy to pack up and move when the time comes.  roy furchgott  circuits

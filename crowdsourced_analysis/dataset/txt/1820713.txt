critics' choice: new cds   erin mckeown  ''sing you sinners''  (nettwerk)  whether or not you warm to ''sing you sinners,'' erin mckeown's breezy album of popular standards (several of them obscure) depends on the rigidity of your musical purism. ms. mckeown and her folk-punk swing band let nothing stand in their way as they pluck songs out of their museum cases, blow off the dust and lightly toss them around.  playing guitar and banjo as well as singing, ms. mckeown flaunts an off-handed, tomboyish exuberance that suits vintage swing numbers like ''thanks for the boogie ride'' popularized in 1941 by anita o'day, a singer she resembles in attitude, if not in style. ''rhode island is famous for you,'' the pun-filled dietz-schwartz comic ode to the smallest state in the union, ''get happy'' and ''sing you sinners'' also bend to her upbeat jocular approach.  but her talky, simplified readings of more musically sophisticated fare like ''something's gotta give,'' ''just one of the those things,'' and ''don't worry 'bout me,'' are problematic. harmonies are pared down to a few rudimentary chords, and ms. mckeown crudely glosses over melodies that she lacks the vocal chops to sing as written. on its own iconoclastic terms, ''sing you sinners'' at least succeeds in giving a fresh, unsentimental spin to familiar material.  ms. mckeown performs at irving plaza tonight and at joe's pub tuesday and wednesday.  stephen holden

quick bite/long beach; first-and-10, starting with brunch   minnesota's in long beach, established in 1994, is the kind of place where everybody knows not only your name, but also which new york football team you pledge allegiance to.  not that it matters whether you root for the jets or the giants. on sundays, fans are welcome to cheer every n.f.l. game being played that day, from the 1 p.m. kickoff to the 8:30 evening game, on one of the 11 plasma screens (42-inch) suspended above and around the massive mahogany bar.  regulars come for the upscale pub atmosphere, acoustic live music between games, and a creative brunch and dinner menu that is served wherever you can find a seat on a rollicking sunday afternoon. perching on a barstool gives you the flexibility to walk around and see multiple games at once. settling in at one of the tables in the adjacent dining room, accented with wrought-iron banisters and a gas fireplace, offers a view of two eight-foot projection screens that create a virtual wall of high-definition football action.  although there are plenty of standard bar menu favorites, like the viking platter combo of chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks and buffalo wings ($16), the appetizers steer into asian fusion territory with a tower of orange-ginger fried calamari, tossed with hearts of palm, bananas and toasted peanuts ($12), and a hearty philly cheese steak egg roll ($9). brunch, served 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. on sundays, includes a selection of omelets ($10), salads ($9 to $14) and burgers ($10). ambitious dinner entrees like sesame-crusted seared ahi tuna ($24) and filet mignon in a cherry-plum wine sauce ($30) are served from 3 until 9 p.m.  with eight beers on tap ($4 to $5) and an elaborate martini bar menu ($7 to $8), there is fuel enough for a gridiron marathon.  minnesota's restaurant and tavern, 959 west beech street, long beach; (516) 432-4080. www.minnesotasny.com.  susan m. novick  long island

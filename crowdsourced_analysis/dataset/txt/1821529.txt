what a teacher needs   to the editor:  bravo to tom moore for ''classroom distinctions'' (op-ed, jan. 19)!  sainthood and martyrdom should not be prerequisites for successful teaching in high-poverty schools. while many teachers qualify on both counts, that is not the sine qua non for making a difference in a child's life.  effective teachers will tell you they need smaller class sizes and a safe, adequately staffed, supportive environment where they are treated as professionals and asked for input.  that's what we fight for every day; and it's the least we can do to help our teachers help our students.  randi weingarten  president  united federation of teachers  new york, jan. 22, 2007

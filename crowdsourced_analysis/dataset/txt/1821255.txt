a laptop designed to take a licking and keep on ticking   ''all terrain'' is not usually a designation associated with things as delicate as hard drives and high-speed memory chips. dell, however, is betting that its latitude atg d620 -- the atg stands for all-terrain grade -- can change that.  the atg d620, which dell says is designed to military specifications, includes a spill-resistant keyboard, heavy-duty case and 14-inch screen, which is visible in direct sunlight. it weighs about 6 pounds with the optical disk drive and battery installed, and is about 2 inches thick.  the laptop comes in a metal-and-black finish with protective coverings on its serial, video out, modem, ethernet and four u.s.b. ports.  inside the hard shell is an intel core 2 duo processor, running at up to 2 gigahertz, and up to 4 gigabytes of memory. the least expensive model ($2,499) runs at 1.6 gigahertz and includes an 80-gigabyte drive and 512 megabytes of memory.  dell includes a fingerprint scanner for security, while military and other security-conscious users can enable the laptop's built-in smart card reader and other data encryption technology.  while it won't survive a dunk in the deep, the atg d620 can survive a splash of mud or a good, hard drop.  john biggs  circuits

corrections   an article on thursday about opposition to a high-explosive test in the nevada desert because of fears it would propel radioactive particles in the soil from nuclear weapons tests misstated the number of nuclear tests there from 1951 to 1992. it is 928, not 100. the article also misidentified the unit of measure for radiation exposure. it is the millirem, not milliliter.

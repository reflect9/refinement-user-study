stage mother   a playwright's work is his or her intellectual property as long as it remains in copyright (the ethicist, jan. 7). cutting or revising it is like renting a house and then renovating without permission. the ethicist claims that ''if a play is well known, no production, however nutty, can do its author much harm.'' but this assumes that the entire audience will be familiar with the play in its intended form. this is not always the case. it's one thing if an audience encounters a bad production, but another one entirely if it encounters a version of the show that is not even representative of the playwright's work.  peter ullian  beacon, n.y.

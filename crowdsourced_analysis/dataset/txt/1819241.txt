jockeying to be first state   last week new hampshire seemed to come up with a way to reassert its traditional election-year primacy despite the new 2008 schedule making the so-called first primary state the third to vote in the democratic nominating process -- after the iowa and nevada caucuses.  wmur-tv in manchester, n.h., the union leader of new hampshire and cnn announced last week that they would hold the first candidates' debates of the presidential election season this year, with back-to-back democratic and republican debates in early april. they stood to be the earliest nationally televised debates of a presidential nominating season in memory.  they also trumped a democratic debate scheduled in south carolina for later in april, which was initially billed as the first of the season, and a republican debate in that state in may. but just a day after the new hampshire announcement, the nevada democrats said they would hold a candidates ''forum'' on feb. 21, making that potentially the first big event of the campaign cycle.  your move, new hampshire.  jim rutenberg  political action: 2008 race

turning 60 and reflecting on the past   when nina taylor, the design studio manager of graham & brown, an english wallpaper manufacturer, created the drama collection to mark the company's 60th anniversary, she looked to its archives for old designs she could update, many of which had never been produced as wallcoverings. the lozenge-shaped boheme, below left, was based on a hand-painted design from the 1970s. to create the new pattern, ms. taylor ''straightened the lines,'' she said, ''so it would repeat more easily.'' midsummer, a delicate leaf pattern created in 2000, left, was merely simplified. ''it had been more mottled, more painterly, more textured,'' she said. the collection includes six other patterns. a double roll, 20.5 inches by 11 yards, sells for $60 at www.grahambrown.com or (800) 554-0887.  elaine louie  currents: wallpaper

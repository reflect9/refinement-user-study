officially trans-fat-free, but how does it cook?   crisco has been around since 1911, almost as long as the process called partial hydrogenation, which turns vegetable oil into shortening but also creates unhealthy trans fats. since 2002, when the j. m. smucker company bought the brand, its food scientists have tried to create trans-fat-free crisco. a 2004 version wasn't quite as creamy as the original and left pie crusts a little tough. now comes a formula that so closely mirrors the original that the company will no longer produce anything but crisco with zero trans fat per serving. it is soft and easy to work with, and makes a pie crust that stays tender and flaky even after a couple of days. the trick, the company said, was to find enough of the right kind of soy and cottonseed oils that wouldn't raise saturated fat levels. but take note: the new crisco lists partially hydrogenated oil as an ingredient. federal labeling laws allow a product to be deemed trans-fat-free if there is less than half a gram per serving.  kim severson  food stuff

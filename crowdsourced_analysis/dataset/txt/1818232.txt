bush's iraq plan, between the lines   president bush has presented a new strategy for the war in iraq that he feels can reverse the country's drift toward large-scale civil war. the new plan focuses on stabilizing baghdad by adding thousands of american troops with newly expanded powers to take on shiite as well as sunni rebels. it also includes a limited increase in united states forces in anbar province, and calls for iraqi forces to take formal control of the security mission in november. the president was refreshingly candid, saying that ''where mistakes have been made, the responsibility rests with me.''  but taken as a whole, the speech raised more questions than it answered. below, i've selected a number of important phrases from the address that beg for more detailed discussion, and included my own analysis of the validity and practicality of what the president seems to have in mind.  -- anthony h. cordesman, senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington.  op-ed contributor

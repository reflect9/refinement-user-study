carey at center stage   former gov. hugh l. carey, 87, has had quite a week in the spotlight. on monday, he was an honored guest at mr. spitzer's inauguration, and on wednesday, he received a standing ovation during mr. spitzer's state of the state message. in an interview afterward, he seemed delighted to see a fellow democrat control the governor's office after 12 years of republican rule.  ''rip van winkle just got a bad case of insomnia,'' mr. carey quipped. he was referring to mr. spitzer's inaugural address, which compared the state during the pataki years to rip van winkle, the washington irving character who was asleep for 20 years. mr. carey, new york's governor from 1975 through 1982, said of mr. spitzer's address: ''it's a very big agenda, but it's not too big for new york. a lot of good reform measures.''  sewell chan  changeover in albany

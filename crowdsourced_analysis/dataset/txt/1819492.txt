corrections   an article in business day yesterday about johnnie m. burton, who runs the interior department's troubled program to collect royalties on oil and gas pumped on public lands, misstated the circumstances under which gov. jim geringer of wyoming, who had named ms. burton to run the state's department of revenue, left office. wyoming term-limit laws prevented mr. geringer, a republican, from running for re-election in 2002; he was not ''ousted'' by voters.

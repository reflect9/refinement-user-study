a new video posted on web shows hussein after his death   a graphic new video of saddam hussein's dead body, apparently taken shortly after he was hanged, was posted on the internet on tuesday by a group sympathetic to the former dictator.  the release of the new video came as criticism of how mr. hussein was taunted and cursed as he stood on the gallows continued to reverberate here and across the world.  the new video does not show the hanging. instead, mr. hussein is shown afterward, with his neck unnaturally twisted at a 90-degree angle to his right and a huge gash on the left side of his neck, just below his jaw line.  it was posted on a web site that supports mr. hussein's now-outlawed baath party, apparently in an attempt to stir more anger among the sunni minority here that is opposed to the shiite-dominated government of prime minister nuri kamal al-maliki.  mr. maliki rushed to execute mr. hussein despite warnings from some american officials that he should proceed with greater caution. since then, a different, surreptitiously taken video of the hanging itself, which includes mr. hussein's executioners chanting the name of a radical shiite cleric, has become a rallying symbol for sunnis.  mr. maliki has been unapologetic about the way his government conducted the execution, accusing critics of ignoring the terrible crimes mr. hussein committed.  the grainy video is 27 seconds long and appears to have been shot with a camera phone. mr. hussein's body is seen on a gurney, covered with a white blanket. the camera pans up his wrapped body as the sheet is pulled back to reveal his face and a deep wound cutting through his grizzled beard.  in daily violence, more than 20 people were killed in attacks across iraq on monday. in one episode, gunmen ambushed a bus bringing workers to baghdad international airport, killing four passengers and wounding nine. elsewhere, five members of one family were killed in the dora district of baghdad.  the reach of war

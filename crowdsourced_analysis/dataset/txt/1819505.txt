corrections   an article in the arts on saturday about an exhibition in washington focusing on design inspired by shakespeare's globe theater omitted a passage. it should have read: ''and the theater's basic design elements, such as they are known, have inspired loose architectural interpretations that range from the polygonal festival theater in stratford, ontario, to a globe made entirely of ice hundreds of miles above the arctic circle in sweden. the continuing fascination with shakespeare's theater and the myriad efforts to replicate its spirit -- and, in many cases, its actual form -- is the subject of 'reinventing the globe: a shakespearean theater for the 21st century,' an exhibition that opens on saturday at the national building museum here as part of the city's six-month shakespeare in washington festival.''

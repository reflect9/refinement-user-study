yury golubev, 64, a founder of yukos oil   yury a. golubev, a founder of yukos oil, the former energy giant once led by mikhail b. khordokovsky, died sometime last weekend in london. he was 64.  a yukos representative confirmed that a visitor to mr. golubev's london apartment discovered his body on monday. a post-mortem confirmed that ''death was by natural causes,'' a statement by the london metropolitan police said, adding, ''this death is not treated as suspicious.''  mr. golubev is credited with helping to create yukos, which was russia's most prominent and successful company until the russian government began to systematically dismantle it beginning in 2003.  having worked abroad as a senior soviet trade official in canada and other countries, he was one of the few russian businessmen after the collapse of the soviet union with knowledge of western market practices.  mr. golubev was one of the architects behind yukos's effort, starting in the late 1990s, to become a transparent western-style corporation.  he was never implicated in the russian government's legal and prosecutorial assault on the company, which faced crippling back-tax bills that ultimately led to its bankruptcy in 2006. in 2005 mr. khodorkovsky, yukos's chairman and a close partner of mr. golubev, was tried and convicted on charges of fraud and tax evasion that critics have denounced as politically motivated.  mr. golubev is survived by his wife and two daughters.

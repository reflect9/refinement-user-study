3 from the bush advertising team join mccain's '08 advisers   senator john mccain of arizona has enlisted strategists from president bush's advertising team to work on the senator's nascent drive for the republican presidential nomination, aides with his campaign exploratory committee said friday.  mr. mccain's aides said he was hiring those three strategists -- russ schriefer, stuart stevens and fred davis -- as part of a continuing accumulation of campaign advisers.  mr. schriefer and mr. stevens, partners at a consulting firm based in washington, helped produce some of the most hard-charging advertisements of mr. bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns.  among their commercials in 2004 was one featuring senator john kerry of massachusetts, the democratic nominee, saying that he did vote for an $87 billion war appropriation ''before i voted against it.'' another had video of mr. kerry windsurfing back and forth, an image reflecting the bush campaign's accusation that he was a flip-flopper.  mr. davis, based in california, has worked on commercials including those in the 2004 campaign in which mr. bush and the first lady spoke directly into the camera in the white house residence.

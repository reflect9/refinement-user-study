the new fellini spectacle   to the editor:  re ''the whole world is watching, why aren't americans?'' by a. o. scott [jan. 21]:  it is no surprise that americans stay away from today's foreign films. my generation grew up watching the great films of ingmar bergman, fran√ßois truffaut and federico fellini. but it was easier then to spend two hours visiting a difficult universe, because we returned to a less hostile world. with war in iraq, genocide in darfur, global warming and the constant threat of terrorism, why watch a movie about the slow death of an alcoholic in romania? instead we tune in to this generation's version of a fellini movie: ''american idol.'' it has freakish-looking people who provide the eerie music themselves. honestly, real life is hard enough.  patti wollman  manhattan  foreign films

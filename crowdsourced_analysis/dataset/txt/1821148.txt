pucker up and smile: a bottle full of surprises   here is a taste of sunshine just when you need it. the kitchen at agata & valentina, 1505 first avenue (79th street), is preparing preserved lemons, but with a bright, palate-pleasing departure from the salt-cured moroccan recipe. it uses meyer lemons, which are sweeter than regular lemons, and cures them not just with salt but also with a touch of sugar, then bathes them in olive oil.  the resulting wedges can be served as a condiment alongside grilled fish or chicken. the salt does not have to be rinsed off and the flesh and the tender peel can be eaten. the lemons are also excellent tucked into the cavity of a whole fish before roasting. refrigerate them but bring them to room temperature for about 30 minutes before using, so the oil can liquefy. they are $6.99 for 15 ounces.  food stuff

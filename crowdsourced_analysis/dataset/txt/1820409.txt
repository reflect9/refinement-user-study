''we had a great time,'' mr. fixler said. ''i thought she was terrific and fun and beautiful and i was very very attracted to her. and the fact that we had three bottles of champagne might have helped.''  ''but, it was not a good time for me,'' he continued. ''i was divorced and involved in a relationship. so i walked her home and said, 'maybe we could have lunch.' ''  her reaction: ''i thought, 'what a turkey,' '' ms. marber said.  a year later, his relationship over, he left a phone message in her office. ''i had no idea who herb fixler was but i was sufficiently intrigued to call back,'' she said. ''we went out for dinner, and again it was terrific.''  with that, ms. marber's and mr. fixler's romance got its start, and continued for more than a decade. during that time they began to refer to each other as ''spouselike objects.''  ''i coined that phrase because we always considered ourselves as married,'' mr. fixler said. ''when we planned a dinner for our 10th anniversary, i started to think maybe we should really get married. i always knew i wanted to be with her forever.''  weddings/celebrations

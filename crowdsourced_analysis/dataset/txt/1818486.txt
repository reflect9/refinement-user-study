arts, briefly; tony, we love you   original episodes and reruns of ''the sopranos'' have been running on hbo since 1999 and are on dvd. but that didn't stop 4.3 million viewers from watching the basic-cable premiere of the series's first episode on wednesday night on a&e, according to nielsen estimates released by the channel. a&e, which is planning to run two episodes of the series each wednesday night (edited for language, violence and nudity), said its debut showing was well above its prime-time average last year (by more than 200 percent) and good enough to beat the ratings of any other advertiser-supported cable channel that night.  jacques steinberg

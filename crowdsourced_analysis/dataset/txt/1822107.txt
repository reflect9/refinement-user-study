corrections   because of an editing error, an article last sunday about furniture stores in dumbo, brooklyn, misstated the context of a quotation by robert siewert, the manager at wonk, one of the stores. when mr. siewert said, ''this building, before they started getting kicked out, was mostly artist studios,'' he was referring to a building at 68 jay street, where his store is located -- not to the nearby j condominiums.

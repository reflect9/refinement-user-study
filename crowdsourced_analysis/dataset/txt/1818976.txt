39 schools miss proficiency targets   thirty-nine long island schools failed to meet targets for bringing their students to proficiency under state and federal guidelines in the 2005-6 school year, the state education department said last week. many of the schools are in advanced stages of corrective action, including restructuring, because they have failed for a number of years, but five are new to the list.  at the same time, 10 schools on the island, including high schools in westbury and south huntington, improved their performance enough to return to good standing.  schools are declared in need of improvement if enough of their students do not meet proficiency standards on tests in english and mathematics in elementary, middle and secondary schools. for the first time, schools were judged on scores of students in grades 3, 5, 6 and 7, in addition to grades 4, 8 and 11.  not only must schools show improvement over all, they must also meet achievement targets for component groups, including racial categories and special education.  four suffolk county schools -- paca middle school in the william floyd district, mulligan and cordello avenue schools in central islip, and hemlock elementary in brentwood -- are new to the list of schools needing improvement. so is fulton school in hempstead in nassau county.  among the 10 schools removed from the failing list were walt whitman high school and henry l. stimson middle school in south huntington. ''we analyzed the warning signs of students that were not doing well, and we analyzed the exam, and we put in place practices to get those kids remediated,'' superintendent thomas shea said. ''i like to say we've narrowed the cracks in the system.''  ford fessenden  the week

rethinking income gap   to the editor:  re ''the american way of equality'' (column, jan. 14):  as an economist who favors free markets and eschews media ''warnings'' of rising income inequality, i liked most of what david brooks wrote (through the lens of seymour martin lipset) about why socialism never caught on in this country.  yes, our hopes and desires for a better life (whatever that entails) have been typically acted upon first by ourselves and secondarily by the government -- keeping ''big brother'' at bay.  but when a society's media keep harping on growing income inequality, as if there are evil forces producing income differences (at a time when our economy is robust), segments of society can eventually ease up and look for help.  as mr. brooks said, the democrats have responded to perceived pleas for help with ''pebbles'' -- but where there are pebbles, there are usually rocks and also boulders. that's what troubles me.  paul ryscavage  washington, jan. 16, 2007  the writer is the author of a book about income inequality.

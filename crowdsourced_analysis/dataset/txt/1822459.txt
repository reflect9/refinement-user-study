bygones   as bronx borough president, fernando ferrer often angered the new york yankees' principal owner, george steinbrenner, by opposing efforts to move the team to manhattan.  mr. steinbrenner is not known for uttering the word ''bygones.'' but a company in which mr. ferrer holds an ownership stake, the poder insurance agency, may receive a small portion of the insurance business on the construction of the yankees' new stadium in the bronx, said howard j. rubenstein, a spokesman for mr. steinbrenner.  though the arrangement has not been completed, the yankees are seeking to award part of the insurance business to minority-owned firms, including e. g. bowman, which has an alliance with poder, mr. rubenstein said.  ''it's a recognition of the need for diversity,'' he said.  russ buettner  the empire zone

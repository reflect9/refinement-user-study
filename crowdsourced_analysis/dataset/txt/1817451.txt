a rocky senate debut   it was not, perhaps, the most auspicious beginning. more than 75 friends and associates who visited albany on wednesday for the swearing-in of joseph a. griffo, a new state senator, came down with a nasty stomach bug afterward, triggering an investigation by the state and local health departments.  ''i was hoping that it wasn't freshman hazing,'' said senator griffo, a republican from rome who was previously the oneida county executive. he said that within 24 hours of the ceremony his office began fielding calls from sickened people who had made the trip.  marc carey, a spokesman for the state health department, said that the sickness did not appear severe, but that investigators were studying whether the affected people had eaten the same food, or gotten sick some other way.  several other people who were at the capitol on wednesday but who did not attend the griffo event also reported becoming sick.  senator griffo added that the clergyman who had sworn him in was spared the unpleasantness. ''i think the collar may have protected him,'' the senator said.  michael cooper  albany notebook

off-duty correction officer kills man in traffic dispute   an off-duty new york state correction officer fatally shot a man during a traffic dispute last night near la guardia airport in queens, the police said. it was unclear how the dispute, which apparently began with a honked horn, escalated to gunfire.  the shooting took place shortly after 7 p.m. when the officer, identified by the state department of correctional services as emilio maldonado, 29, stopped his car behind a sport utility vehicle at a stoplight at ditmars avenue and 94th street, investigators said. after the light turned green, mr. maldonado apparently honked his horn.  the police said two men who were in the sport utility vehicle got out and approached mr. maldonado's car, where he was sitting with his wife and child, the police said. the two men and mr. maldonado got into a dispute, perhaps involving a struggle for the officer's gun, investigators said. mr. maldonado fired one shot, hitting one of the men in the chest.  the person who was shot, identified only as a 36-year-old man, was taken to elmhurst hospital center, where he later died, the police said. the other man, also not identified, fled the scene, according to the police, who said he was later caught and taken to the 115th precinct station house for questioning. the correction officer was also being questioned by the police last night.  mr. maldonado works at the bedford hills correctional facility in westchester county, the state's only maximum security prison for women, according to linda foglia, a spokeswoman for the department of correctional services. she said that mr. maldonado's personal weapon was registered with the department.  ''they are able to carry their guns when they are off-duty,'' ms. foglia said. ''they are peace officers. they have the ability to make arrests.''  she added: ''they are required to register their weapon with our agency and he did so. so on our end, he is following the appropriate procedures.''

critics' choice: new cds   pretty ricky  ''late night special'' (atlantic)  at least the members of pretty ricky have their priorities straight. pretty ricky is a rapping-and-singing boy band: four brothers in their 20s from florida, all devoted to the task of making young female listeners scream. and on their single-minded second album, ''late night special,'' they take turns chatting up the fans. one of the more memorable requests: ''let me do you after school, like some homework, but please/don't gimme no s.t.d.'s.'' pro-homework, anti-herpes. who could argue with that?  well perhaps a few nervous parents could. but if your goal is to be a member of the smuttiest boy band in the country, you can't worry about censorious moms. you have to keep right on singing, or rapping, secure in your knowledge that a double-entendre is one entendre too many. suffice it to say that ''up and down'' isn't about the price of oil.  pretty ricky's debut, ''bluestars,'' has sold more than 800,000 copies. and ''late night special'' is a well-made and weirdly likable follow-up. rowdy (if rudimentary) rhymes enliven the slow jams and silky (or, at any rate, rayon-y) refrains make the club tracks even smoother. it could even be argued that there's something brave about the way these fellows own up to their bad intentions. lots of boy-banders promise to love you forever; these are honest enough to ask instead, ''can i put a little peer pressure on ya?''  kelefa sanneh

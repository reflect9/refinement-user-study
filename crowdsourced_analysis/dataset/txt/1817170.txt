long island city: happy to be unhip   to the editor:  re ''the duel over cool'' (dec. 10): as a lifelong resident of long island city, i feel as if i can speak for many other ''lifers'' when i say that we don't want to be compared with williamsburg, and we don't care what you think of us.  here's a newsflash: there are people who have grown up in long island city who are successful, literate folks who would like to live out their years here. they also like being off the hip map. non-new yorkers have already ruined williamsburg and little italy, and are now spilling over into long island city.  this city has become gentrified enough. we do not need people like you pitting neighborhoods against each other.  elisa wright  long island city, queens

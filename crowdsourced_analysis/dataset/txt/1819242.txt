population shifts   census projections analyzed by the firm election data services show that population losses in louisiana after hurricane katrina could cost the state a congressional seat after the 2010 census. louisiana is not the only projected loser: seven states in the northeast and the midwest would drop congressional seats as residents migrate to the south and the west, where six states would gain seats. texas, which has absorbed some louisiana transplants, would gain two. the trend would seem to be good for republicans, who have dominated those regions, though democrats have made inroads. new districts will be drawn by state legislatures.  carl hulse  political action

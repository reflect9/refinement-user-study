world briefing | europe: czech republic: vote ends stalemate   prime minister mirek topolanek's newly appointed coalition cabinet narrowly won a critical vote of confidence, ending a political stalemate that had left the country without an active government since elections last june. those elections left the 200-seat parliament evenly divided between rival coalitions. the deadlock was broken when two legislators from mr. topolanek's opposition broke ranks and backed his cabinet in the vote. but mr. topolanek warned that the political crisis might not be over if the continued partisan split made it impossible for the new government to act effectively.  craig s. smith

after pataki's 12 years, is new york better off?   to the editor:  re ''the george pataki era'' (editorial, dec. 31): in gov. george e. pataki's first budget, he cut state school aid to new york city while increasing it for the rest of the state, leading to a drastic cutback in the city's public school spending at a moment that enrollment was rising.  in 1997, he pushed through his school tax relief program, known as star, which directed rising state aid to the affluent suburban districts that spend the most, raising the average state aid per student in the affluent downstate suburban counties to almost as high as in new york city. in exchange for star, he promised city legislators a state bond referendum to fix the city's aging schools -- a bond issue that was later defeated.  nothing else mr. pataki has done has had as great an impact on as many people. elsewhere in the country, those living in districts with larger tax bases and less needy students face a state education aid system that redistributes their state taxes to less well-off districts.  only mr. pataki could successfully achieve a state education aid system that redistributes education resources away from new york city, home of a majority of the state's neediest children. this is his true legacy.  larry littlefield  windsor terrace, brooklyn

where cars win out   to the editor:  in ''environmental harmony'' (editorial, jan. 1), you fault the bush administration for doing nothing to create or enforce a national policy on global warming, including production of fuel-efficient cars.  yet the administration may be more in touch with the electorate than not, for little is done on a local level to recognize these realities.  in my state, billions are devoted to accommodating increased traffic without regard to global warming, fossil-fuel consumption, air pollution, land loss, road deaths, debt to foreign nations or even war to ensure access to oil.  but whenever there is planning for public transportation, expense is cited as the obstacle.  david ray  tucson, jan. 1, 2007

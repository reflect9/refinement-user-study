speaking of severance   as mr. nardelli found out, chief executives don't have to lift a company's stock price to leave with a nice, fat severance package.  consider fabian mansson, the chief executive of eddie bauer since 2003. after the company exited bankruptcy in the summer of 2005, its stock was trading above $30. but the company lost almost $300 million in the first three quarters of 2006, so the stock is now trading around $9.  if mr. mansson leaves eddie bauer, which became more likely when the company agreed in november to be acquired by two buyout firms, he will be in a position to receive at least $10 million in severance benefits.  eddie bauer will also buy him a new home in his native sweden, according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission.  jeremy w. peters  openers: suits

the listings: jan. 26-feb. 1; susan marshall & company   if you saw susan marshall's ''cloudless'' last march at dance theater workshop, you already know that it deserves a second look. thankfully, the powers that be -- or those that were, in the case of cathy edwards, who until recently was artistic director -- thought so, too. the work, a bessie award-winning dance suite, was brought back for a two-week return. ms. marshall's web site (susanmarshallandcompany.org) describes the simply named solos, duets and group pieces (18 in all) in ''cloudless'' as ''short-form narratives,'' but to this eye the small but expansive dances read more like poems, governed by a lyrical internal logic. ''cloudless'' represented a move away from full-length work for ms. marshall. it's true -- these aren't large-scale works -- but the imagination at play is so grand. vignettes, many dealing with intimacy and sexual power struggles, are both individual pieces and parts of a sweeping whole. props and theater share time with abstract, yet telling, dance. as the title perhaps implies, ms. marshall gives a very clear view of complex, fraught relationships. her eye extends to her dancers, who have all been well chosen. whether strapped to a ladder, serving one another other tea in highly unorthodox fashion or making minute movements count for a lot, dancers like petra van noort ( shown with joseph poulson, above) grab attention and hold it, hard. (tonight and tomorrow night, and tuesday through saturday nights at 7:30, dance theater workshop, 219 west 19th street, chelsea, 212-924-0077, dtw.org; $25; $15 for members, students and 65+.)  claudia la rocco

corrections   an article last sunday about the newyork-presbyterian healthcare system referred incorrectly to the history of hospitals that was chronicled in ''the care of strangers: the rise of america's hospital system,'' by charles e. rosenberg. the number of hospitals in the united states grew from only two in 1800, according to the book; there were not only two in the early 1900s. and a census of hospitals in 1909, not 1920, showed more than 4,300 hospitals housing more than 420,000 beds.

metro briefing | new york: manhattan: city projects surplus   new york city's short-term fiscal outlook looks very bright because the local economy remains strong and tax revenues have been coming in at higher rates than expected, according to a report released yesterday by the city's independent budget office. the office projected a surplus of $2.1 billion for the 2007 fiscal year, which ends on june 30, and, assuming that that money is used to pay future expenses in advance, a surplus of $688 million for the 2008 fiscal year. the office said it expected deficits of $2.9 billion in fiscal 2009 and $2.7 billion in fiscal 2010, the last year of mayor michael r. bloomberg's term -- but added that those projected shortfalls were smaller than what the mayor's office of management and budget had projected.  sewell chan

help the homeless   to the editor:  re ''antique dealer sues to bar homeless from sidewalk'' (news article, jan. 18): the merchants of madison avenue would do better to band together and work with new york city and nonprofit providers in coordinated action to help the chronically homeless make the transition off the streets and into shelters and permanent homes.  while suing may draw temporary attention to the matter, it will hardly provide permanent relief for residents, business owners or the homeless, who need patience, treatment and a roof over their heads, not time in front of a judge.  richard motta  president and c.e.o., volunteers  of america-greater new york  new york, jan. 22, 2007

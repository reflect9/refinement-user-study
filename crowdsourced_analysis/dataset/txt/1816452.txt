the listings: jan. 5 - jan. 11; fresh tracks   another year, another edition of fresh tracks. if you're still looking for the perfect way to mark the new year, you could do worse than this, dance theater workshop's longstanding showcase for new dance. created in 1965, fresh tracks is the workshop's longest-running series for new choreography, and it is highly competitive. its choreographers have ranged from bill t. jones to anne teresa de keersmaeker. the latest roster, chosen through open auditions, is all female: ursula eagly, lala ghahreman, heather mcardle, tara o'con, deganit shemy and ani weinstein. fresh tracks is not just an opportunity for choreographers to gain exposure; the program last year also began offering each artist a residency, including 50 hours of rehearsal space and training sessions in grant writing, fund-raising and marketing. service changes aside, fresh tracks remains the usual grab bag of short works. ms. shemy will present ''queen-tet,'' a tricky ensemble for five women, performed in israel in 2005. ms. mcardle, above, who some dancegoers may remember from david dorfman's ''underground'' at the brooklyn academy of music, will present work by her own company, blueprintviolation. ms. weinstein will close each evening with her solo ''show me the body,'' inspired by both the legal proceedings surrounding detainees at guant√°namo bay and by paul auster's ''invention of solitude.'' (tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, dance theater workshop, 219 west 19th street, chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $12 and $20.)  claudia la rocco

corrections   a sports article on saturday about the former quarterback koy detmer, who was signed by the philadelphia eagles to be the holder on kicks in the playoffs, misidentified the special-teams coach. he is john harbaugh, not jim harbaugh. (the harbaughs are brothers. jim was recently hired as head coach at stanford university.)

critics' choice: new cds   the good, the bad & the queen  (virgin)  mood music doesn't get any moodier than the good, the bad & the queen, a new art-rock collaboration led by damon albarn of gorillaz and blur. a queasy look at contemporary london, the album is full of crackheads and battered dreamers, soldiers and kids who ''drink all day/'cause the country is at war.'' the music is thick with dub-laced dread and barely seems to crawl, quite a surprise given the hip-shaking pedigrees of the talent on hand: tony allen, the drummer and afrobeat pioneer, and danger mouse, half of gnarls barkley and this album's producer. in a group photo the bassist paul simonon, formerly of the clash, has black eyes and a bandaged nose, as if he had been clubbed for trying to rock too hard.  considering the way gorillaz mix doom with slinky beats, the good, the bad & the queen is willfully hookless, though the music has a somber beauty. on ''80's life'' danger mouse tries to cheer everyone up with doo-wop choruses and electronic pings and squiggles. mr. albarn is upset about iraq and his own lost innocence, calling england a ''stroppy little island of mixed-up people.'' pushing 40, he longs for eras he once condemned (see blur's ''parklife,'' from 1994) and seems almost paralyzed by sadness. but finally, on the last song, the sun takes a clich√©d trip ''out of the clouds,'' and the band makes some noise, unable to wallow any longer.  sia michel

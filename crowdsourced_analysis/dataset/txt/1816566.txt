arts, briefly; sugar bowl victory for fox   football once again reigned in the ratings on wednesday, as fox's coverage of the sugar bowl led the night in every half-hour, according to nielsen's estimates. in the race for no. 2, cbs outdrew nbc, and both networks overshadowed the premieres on abc. cbs's only new show of the night, ''the king of queens,'' ranked second at 8 p.m. with 8.6 million viewers. it was followed by repeats of ''two and a half men'' at 8:30 (8.5 million), ''criminals minds'' at 9 (11.9 million) and ''csi: new york'' at 10 (10.4 million). nbc was not far behind, getting a boost from ''deal or no deal'' at 9 (11.3 million) and ''medium'' at 10 (9.3 million). faring less well for nbc, ''friday night lights'' earned 6.3 million viewers at 8. abc was last over all, despite the season premiere of ''according to jim'' at 8 (7.4 million). neither of abc's new comedies, ''knights of prosperity'' at 9 (7.2 million) or ''in case of emergency'' at 9:30 (6.3 million), fared better than fourth place.  benjamin toff

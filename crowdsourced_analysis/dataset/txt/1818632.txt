hotels go hi-tech to help their guests get out and about   the latest trend among upscale hotels is no longer amenities that keep guests inside the hotel (wifi, plasma screen tvs, dvd players) but rather gadgets encouraging them to leave.  at the new regent south beach (www.regenthotels.com) visitors checking into one of the 27 rooftop terrace suites are given the regent pocket butler, below, a cellphone the size of a credit card that can be looped onto a key chain and used anywhere in south florida. unlike normal phones, however, the pocket butler has only four buttons -- one each to contact guest services, the hotel's chauffeurs, the hotel concierge and a personal 24-hour butler (''tea at 4, please, jeeves!'').  at the five-star rome cavalieri hilton (www.cavalieri-hilton.it) guests are handed a personal ''city navigator.'' it is both an mp3 player, with two loaded audio tours, and a digital camera, making it easy for visitors to take snapshots during the six-hour walks. each tour covers roughly four to five miles and includes 20 major sights in the eternal city -- from the colosseum and the pantheon to the spanish steps and the trevi fountain. once back at the hotel, the concierge will happily download the photos onto a compact disc.  starting april 1, guests at the hilton arc de triomphe (www.hilton-paris.com/arcdetriomphe) in paris will be able to rent a taocity p.d.a. in either english or french for 10 euros, or $13.50 at $1.35 to the euro. the device has a detailed touch-screen map fitted with a g.p.s. system -- a handy feature when navigating the 12 avenues that radiate from Ã‰toile. not only can it map the way to hundreds of restaurants, bars and shops, it also serves as a guide to hundreds of historic sites and works of art in the city's museums.  in transit

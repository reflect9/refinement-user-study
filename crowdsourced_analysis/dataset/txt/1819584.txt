indulgence times two: a chocolatier and a chandelier   living next door to a chocolate shop has obvious benefits, but for michel trico, a self-taught chandelier designer, it has provided something unexpected: the opportunity to start a business. ms. trico, above, has been selling chandeliers to friends for years, but since one of her fixtures -- a five-foot frame decorated with gilded cutlery and 500 teardrop crystals -- was installed in the cacao bar at mariebelle in soho two months ago, her work has been generating public interest. ''customers are constantly asking about it,'' said maribel lieberman, the store's owner. ''it's really a conversation starter.'' ms. trico's chandeliers, which combine elements like swarovski crystal, art deco frames, strings of natural pearls and jade disks the size of dinner plates, start at $5,000; maisondelumiere@yahoo.com or (347) 393-9725.  liz arnold  currents: lighting

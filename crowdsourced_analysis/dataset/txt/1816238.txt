for budget-minded hipsters, rooms that economize on space   imagine if ian schrager opened a youth hostel. such is the concept behind the pod hotel, which is opening on east 51st street in stages this month, with rooms becoming available as they are completed.  formerly the pickwick arms, a drab midtown lodging, the pod hotel holds 347 rooms barely larger than walk-in closets. a 100-square-foot hotel room for two may be a tough sell, even in new york. but the owners are betting that guests (target age: 18 to 25) will overlook the cramped quarters if they offer high design at a low price. rates start at $89 a night for a compact single room, above left, made for the traveler who just wants to dive into bed.  ''our guest is the stylish spendthrift,'' said richard born, a principal of bd hotels, which also owns manhattan hotels like the maritime and the mercer.  the pod hotel is the first of its kind to open in the united states, though capsule hotels have operated in japan for more than two decades. the stripped-down easyhotel opened in london in 2005, and the chain has since spread through europe and asia.  vanessa guilford, the pod hotel's designer, has echoed transportation's efficient use of space. bunk beds suggest sleeper cars on trains, and in rooms without bathrooms, a symbol above the door turns green when a shared hallway bathroom is vacant -- a detail borrowed from airplanes. flip-down coat hooks are the same as those found on amtrak trains.  ''the idea was to keep it all cheap and cheerful,'' ms. guilford said, ''and to simplify it as much as possible.'' in the lounge, above right, a mural by james rizzi sets the tone. the pod hotel is at 230 east 51st street. for reservations, (212) 355-0300.  michael cannell  currents: hotels

task gets taller for g.o.p.   when senator wayne allard, republican of colorado, announced monday that he would not seek re-election, the uphill battle for his party to reclaim the senate in 2008 became an even steeper climb.  by the numbers, republicans were already at a disadvantage. twenty-one republican seats will be open, compared with 12 democratic seats. and not having a republican incumbent on the ballot in a competitive state like colorado complicates matters for republicans.  already, campaign politics is infusing substantive debates on capitol hill. many of the incumbent republican senators who have stepped forward to oppose president bush's iraq policy face re-election. (senator gordon h. smith of oregon started the trend late last year, followed by others, including senator norm coleman of minnesota last week.) even before mr. allard's announcement, colorado was emerging as a gateway to the west for democrats, who have won the governor's office, two house districts and a senate seat in the last four years. those successes helped seal the democratic party's decision to hold its 2008 national convention in denver. and now, the state will be host to one of the most closely watched senate races in the nation, too.  jeff zeleny  political action

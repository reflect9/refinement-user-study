mothers and immunization   to the editor:  re ''more education may not mean more vaccination'' (jan. 16): researchers may be overlooking one fairly obvious variable that explains why children of less-educated mothers are more likely to get timely vaccinations than children of more well-educated mothers: the mothers with less education are probably more likely to be receiving state medicaid assistance.  my oldest child (then 2) qualified for medicaid while my husband and i were both in graduate school. it seemed that families on medicaid were the target demographic for every public health campaign, especially immunization, and we were flooded with information. with our second child, we had private insurance, and public health information has been minimal.  marcie francis  bloomington, ind.

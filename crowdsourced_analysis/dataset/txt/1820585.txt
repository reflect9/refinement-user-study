diocese of bridgeport, are you listening?   to the editor:  now that judge jon alander of the state superior court has ordered publication of records relating to priestly sexual abuse within the diocese of bridgeport, bishop william e. lori, as you suggest (''using the victims yet again,'' editorial, jan. 7), should abandon his planned appeal. he should also apologize for justifying suppression of these documents to protect the victims.  the diocese has already expended more than $37 million to settle cases involving priestly sexual abuse and has incurred untold legal expenses in its effort to deny the catholic people full knowledge of this shameful chapter in diocesan history. the money spent to pay lawyers' fees for repeated appeals seeking to impose secrecy on the actions of our priests and bishops could better be used to care for the poor and the needy.  the time for stonewalling has come to an end. the time for accountability and transparency is at hand.  joseph f. o'callaghan  norwalk  the writer is a board member, voice of the faithful in the diocese of bridgeport.

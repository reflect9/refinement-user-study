baby found dead in bronx trash chute   the body of an infant girl was discovered yesterday afternoon at the bottom of a trash chute in a bronx apartment building, the police said.  the baby, described by investigators as hispanic and less than 4 months old, was declared dead at the scene. it was unclear when or how she had died.  last night, investigators searched the 19-story apartment building, at 225 willis avenue in mott haven, with a german shepherd to determined where the baby may have been in the complex.  the baby was found shortly before 4 p.m., when a maintenance worker who was in the trash compactor room heard a loud thud, an investigator said. it did not sound like trash falling, so he looked inside the bin.  one resident, geraldine pinckney, 46, who had heard the maintenance man describe how he had discovered the baby, said: ''he went to see what was in there, and when he opened it, he thought it was a doll baby until he saw the blue lips, and then he knew.''  maintenance workers said that the baby's body was intact and that she appeared to have been dead before being thrown down the chute. investigators said she was wearing a pink hooded coat and a white jumper.  other residents said they did not know of any babies recently born to tenants in the building.  ''i know everyone in this building after 14 years,'' said doris soto, 43. ''i can't believe this happened. i'm trying to remember who i know and who i've seen that has small babies.''  tenants, who were kept waiting outside the building during the investigation last night, were shaken by the discovery. isabelle johnson, 63, president of the tenants association, said: ''this is chaotic. it doesn't make any sense. there are so many outs that you have. you can run away. you can bang on someone's door. anything.''

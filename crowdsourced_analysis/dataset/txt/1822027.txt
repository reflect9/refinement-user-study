correction   a picture with a collecting article last sunday about aston martin was published in error. while a 1961 aston martin db4 gt zagato, described in the article as one of the most charismatic sports cars of the 1960s, was indeed depicted in a front view, the car shown in profile was not a zagato, but a gt with a conventional body.

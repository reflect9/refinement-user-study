arts, briefly; football playoff piles up record ratings   with the best ratings for an american football conference championship game in 10 years, cbs's coverage of the indianapolis colts' victory over the new england patriots on sunday outdrew even last week's ''american idol'' premiere telecasts to usurp the title of highest-rated program of the 2006-7 television season. according to nielsen's estimates, which do not account for discrepancies across time zones, the game averaged approximately 43 million viewers for the night. abc's ''desperate housewives'' was the second-most-watched show on sunday, delivering a much-reduced 17.1 million viewers at 9. ''extreme makeover: home edition'' at 8 (12.6 million) and ''brothers & sisters'' at 10 (11.9 million) helped abc secure a distant but respectable second-place finish for the night. nbc was third over all, as ratings for week 3 of its reality shows ''grease: you're the one that i want'' at 8 (8.1 million) and ''the apprentice'' at 9 (6.9 million) remained steady after falling in the shows' second week.  benjamin toff

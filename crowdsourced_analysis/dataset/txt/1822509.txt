ear tubes not found to affect development   inserting tubes in children with persistent fluid in the ear does not lead to better developmental outcomes as the children age, a new study reports.  tympanostomy, or the insertion of tubes to drain the fluid and improve hearing, is one of the most common pediatric operations and is generally believed to help prevent developmental problems. but this study, published on jan. 18 in the new england journal of medicine, suggests that tubes in otherwise healthy children has no effect on development through age 11.  the researchers studied 429 children younger than 2 months with persistent episodes of fluid in the middle ear. the children were randomly assigned in a clinical trial to undergo tympanostomy promptly or six to nine months later. at the same time, researchers randomly selected a comparison group of 241 children who had persistent fluid in their ears but were not eligible for the clinical trial; almost none of those children received ear tubes.  examinations at ages 9 to 11 with tests of hearing, speech and academic skills showed no significant difference between the children who received early tube placement and those who received later placement. among the children not eligible for the trial, correlations between the duration of episodes of fluid in the ear for various periods in the first three years of life and developmental outcomes at ages 9 to 11 were generally insignificant.  ''these findings do not apply to children with acute infections,'' said dr. jack l. paradise, the lead author and a professor of pediatrics at the university of pittsburgh. ''but with children whose only problem is fluid in the ear, we should be conservative and wait at least a year before considering tubes.''  vital signs: child care

the canapé war   to the editor:  david brooks (''a snit in first class,'' column, jan. 4) asks why there is an endless war between rich democrats and rich republicans when in fact they ultimately have the same self-interest.  but he already answered this question in the same column when he described nancy pelosi's rise to power as a function of her fund-raising prowess.  until elections are not won and lost on the size of campaign contributions, mr. brooks is unlikely to see an end to his ''canapé'' war among rich politicians.  christopher sailer  new york, jan. 4, 2007

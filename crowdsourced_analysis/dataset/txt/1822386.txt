senators argue over bush iraq plan   republican allies of the white house argued on the sunday news programs that resolutions critical of president bush's new iraq plan being considered by the senate would embolden insurgents and demoralize american troops.  but they were faced with counterpoint arguments not only from democrats but also from other republicans. ''what i'll be doing is trying to appeal to my republican colleagues to not pass a nonbinding resolution that basically says to the troops who are going there this is a mission that doesn't have a chance of succeeding,'' senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the republican leader, said on ''face the nation'' on cbs.  but on the same program, senator arlen specter, republican of pennsylvania, said, ''i cannot support sending additional troops to iraq.''  on ''this week'' on abc, senator richard g. lugar, republican of indiana, said the resolutions were ''not helpful'' to the new american commander, lt. gen. david h. petraeus, or ''to the troops, to the iraqis.''  on ''fox news sunday,'' senator sam brownback of kansas, a republican presidential contender, said he was considering voting for a resolution criticizing the plan. that resolution also lays out benchmarks for the iraqis to achieve and states that the senate's intention is not to countermand the president's authority as commander in chief.  the senate foreign relations committee has passed a more harshly worded resolution criticizing the plan. its backers include senator chuck hagel, republican of nebraska.

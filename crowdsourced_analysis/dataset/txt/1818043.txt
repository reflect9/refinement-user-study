the antiwar movement   to the editor:  re ''ethics overhaul tops the agenda as the democrats take over'' (news article, jan. 4):  you report that ''the scene vividly illustrated the pressure that democrats will face from the left wing of their party to challenge president bush more aggressively on iraq,'' referring to antiwar demonstrators who interrupted the democrats' news conference introducing ethics legislation.  i feel compelled, as the director of grandmothers against the war, to say that very few of us grannies would characterize ourselves as leftists.  we consider ourselves patriots as we desperately seek to end the catastrophic and immoral occupation of iraq. i'm sure that you are well aware that using such language tends to dismiss us in the minds of many americans -- who have been continually badgered by the bush administration -- into thinking that people on the left are subversive, thereby undermining the peace movement.  inasmuch as the antiwar movement seems to be the only hope for saving lives in the hopeless iraq quagmire, and salvaging america's reputation around the world, i would advise a more judicious choice of words.  joan wile  new york, jan. 4, 2007

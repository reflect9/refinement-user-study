value judgments regarding adoption   to the editor:  i'm sure i'm not the only parent of a child adopted from overseas who didn't appreciate michael winerip's comment that ''while madonna and angelina travel the planet to adopt, there's a plentiful supply right here'' (''a family that kept on growing,'' parenting, jan. 14).  why was that little slap necessary in an otherwise uplifting article about a wonderful family? why must the times jump on the bandwagon of the international adoption critics, who persist in making inappropriate value judgments that some children are more deserving of loving homes than others, simply because they were born ''right here''?  the decision to adopt domestically or internationally is a highly personal one, and there are many valid reasons families choose one or the other path to parenthood. mr. winerip simply chose to fall back on a tired old stereotype.  edith sachs  south orange

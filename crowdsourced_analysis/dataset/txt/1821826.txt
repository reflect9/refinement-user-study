corrections   a front-page article last saturday about complaints by some nonprofit groups of a class divide in philanthropy among chinese-americans misstated the given name of the executive director of the ong family foundation, which makes annual grants to such groups, including the chinese-american planning council, a social service agency. the executive director is nelson louis, not norman. the article also misstated the association that mr. louis and danny ong yee, the foundation's founding trustee, once had with the council. they are former staff members; they did not attend the council's child-care programs as children.

metro briefing | new york: albany: bloomberg aide urges judicial overhaul   citing an ''unprecedented'' crisis of confidence in the state's judiciary, the new york city corporation counsel, michael a. cardozo, yesterday urged quick reform of the state's judicial selection process at a state senate hearing. last year, a federal appeals court found that the nominating system for electing state supreme court justices was unconstitutional, and imposed an interim process of direct primary elections. mr. cardozo, representing mayor michael r. bloomberg, suggested changes to the nominating conventions rather than the use of open primaries in choosing judicial candidates. he also urged that independent commissions be used to weigh supreme court candidates' qualifications.  sewell chan

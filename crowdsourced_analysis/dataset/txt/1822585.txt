prisoners' rights   to the editor:  re ''limits on prison suits are eased'' (news article, jan. 23):  the supreme court did well to reject the procedural obstacles to inmate litigation that federal courts have added to those already placed by the prison litigation reform act of 1995.  but this is mere tinkering at the edges.  after a decade of experience, it is abundantly clear that congress should drastically overhaul it.  departments of correction have used the prison litigation reform act to deny far too many prisoners a fair chance of getting a judicial remedy when they become victims of appalling medical care, staff violence and sexual harassment, among other serious prison abuses.  jamie fellner  director, u.s. program  human rights watch  new york, jan. 23, 2007

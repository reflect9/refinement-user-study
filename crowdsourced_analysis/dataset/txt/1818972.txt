gratefully received, suddenly rescinded   to the editor:  i read ''scraping the bottom of the albany pork barrel'' (dec. 31) with great interest. the spca of westchester was the grateful recipient of a grant in support of our humane law enforcement division through the generous support of senator nicholas a. spano.  surprise, surprise -- we recently were informed by the new york state department of agriculture and markets that our grant had been rescinded. apparently retaliating against the loser is seen as a fair strategy, regardless of the disappointed but deserving constituents.  reforming the system to level the playing field so that discretionary spending is equally available within districts and once pledged, cannot be withdrawn, would certainly be a step in the right direction.  deborah mehne  chairwoman  spca of westchester  briarcliff manor

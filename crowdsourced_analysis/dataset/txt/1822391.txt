finding consolation in a consolidation   david grandeau, the executive director of the temporary state commission on lobbying, has been reading fine print lately.  specifically, he has been looking at controversial new legislation announced last week by gov. eliot spitzer and legislative leaders that would merge the lobbying commission with the state ethics commission. government watchdog groups are concerned that, among other things, mr. grandeau could find himself out of a job in the new commission.  mr. grandeau, below, who is seen as one of the few pursuers of corruption in the capital, sees at least a temporary silver lining.  stiff new penalties for lobbying violations would take effect 30 days after the bill is signed, but the merged commission would not come into being until 180 days after the signing, he noted.  ''so for 150 days, the existing lobby commission and its existing executive director will have the ability to enforce the new gift ban and impose the new fine structure,'' he said. ''i can assure you, i won't be bashful about taking advantage of this new power.''  what is this new power, exactly? presently, there is a $25,000 maximum penalty for not reporting a lobbying expense. that would increase under the new proposal to either a $25,000 maximum or three times the amount one failed to disclose, whichever is greater; penalties are even more severe for making false filings.  getting caught could be expensive. in 1999, for instance, philip morris was fined $75,000 for a number of violations after underreporting by more than $300,000 its lobbying activities. under new rules, such a violation could bring a fine of almost $1 million.  of the new rules, mr. grandeau said, ''that's pretty exciting.''  no wonder this man has so many enemies in the capital.  the empire zone

recycle, but don't iron   to the editor:  re ''can polyester save the world?'' (thursday styles, jan. 25):  here in portland, ore., savvy local fashion designers have another way to reduce the amount of carbon in their fashions.  portland designers often find clothing at garage sales and resale shops and refashion these articles into new, ingenious creations.  i've seen neckties become beautiful belts and arm cuffs; men's suits cut and resewn into unique skirts; and handbags and gloves made out of old sweaters.  in the past few years, i've been adding these refashioned pieces to my own wardrobe, proving that one can dress stylishly and be eco-friendly all at the same time.  leslie carlson  portland, ore., jan. 25, 2007  to the editor:  as one of your more slovenly readers, i am amazed to hear that there are people who iron their cotton t-shirts.  i've heard about such people. i've also heard about bigfoot. and i still don't think either exists.  alexander dering  princeton, n.j., jan. 25, 2007

spoleto premieres to include one by philip glass   look for a number of american premieres at this year's spoleto festival u.s.a. in charleston, s.c. (may 24 to june 10). ''i think we stretched ourselves further than ever with this year's program,'' said nigel redden, the festival's general director, mentioning that the lineup includes more dance (swan lake, rubberbandance) and jazz events (the pianist ahmad jamal) than in previous years.  two operas never before seen by american audiences -- ''faustus, the last night,'' by the contemporary french composer pascal dusapin, and ''l'isle de merlin, ou le monde renvers√©,'' a late-baroque fantasy by gluck, staged by the renowned opera director, christopher alden, will also be shown.  ''book of longing,'' a new work by philip glass, based on leonard cohen's first poetry collection in 20 years, will feature mr. glass, right, on keyboard for its premiere.  ''there is also a social commentary theme running through the festival,'' mr. redden said, citing ''faustus,'' ''the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny,'' by kurt weill and bertolt brecht, and ''the constant wife'' by somerset maugham.  tickets, which cost $10 to $130, can be bought at www.spoletousa.org or by calling the box office at (843) 579-3100. a recent web search found round-trip fares for nonstop flights between la guardia airport in new york and charleston starting at about $300 on carriers including delta air lines, united airlines and us airways.  in transit

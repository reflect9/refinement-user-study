corrections   a sports article on thursday about the sale of naming rights for the nets' planned home in brooklyn referred imprecisely to the arena's anticipated cost. although the price will indeed exceed $550 million, the latest cost projection has raised it to about $637 million. the article also referred incompletely to a park planned atop the arena. it will be a private open space for the complex; it will not be a public park.

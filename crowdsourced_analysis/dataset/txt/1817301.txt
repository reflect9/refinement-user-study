waiting, and waiting, for nsx 2.0   introduced on sunday: acura advanced sports car design study  is it real? the mechanical bits are all present, and the body is metal, not styrofoam. but acura's advanced sports car concept is strictly a nonrunning prototype, with its doors and hood sealed for the run of the auto show.  what's the point? the nsx was acura's two-seat halo car, an asian ferrari that served as a showcase of technology and innovation. since its demise, acura's parent, honda, has been hard at work on a replacement to keep the performance fires burning.  what they said: ''i must tell you that my own passion is performance,'' takeo fukui, president and chief executive of honda motor company, said.  what they didn't say: that this is the next nsx, or that acura is overdue for something more potent than the brand's current crop of v-6 engines. the next episode in the hunt for nsx v2.0 occurs at the tokyo auto show, in october 2007.  what makes it tick? the a.s.c.c. has a front-mounted v-10 coupled to sport-tuned version of acura's all-wheel drive hardware.  how much, how soon? no one would let us peek under the hood, much less mention anything as vulgar as a price or when to expect this car to be production ready.  how's it look? the advanced sports car concept looks familiar -- we see a lot of audi r8, minus the gaping grill, and the lexus lf-a concept of 2005, in this acura's front end. it could probably do with an extra dose of edginess when the second iteration appears in tokyo.

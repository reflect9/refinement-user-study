the computer with a tv, and a family's virtual bulletin board   the notion of a computer at the heart of every home gets a little bump with the multitasking hewlett-packard touchsmart pc, unveiled at the consumer electronics show this week as part of the introduction of the windows vista operating system from microsoft.  the touchsmart, which will cost $1,800 when it goes on sale at the end of the month, has a 19-inch touch-sensitive screen intended to serve as a family bulletin board, with virtual sticky notes written with a finger or stylus -- or even left by voice, in a recorded memo.  this computer is also a high-definition tv, and can play fm radio or stored music through screen-side speakers, or external ones for a home-theater effect. designed as a wire- and clutter-free stand-alone device, it connects to the world via wi-fi and further contains its footprint with a wireless keyboard, mouse and remote control.  the touchsmart's designers envision a user's walking up to it on a kitchen counter, checking e-mail, appointments and weather, leaving family reminders and maybe watching the first 30 seconds of the evening news before dashing out.  marty katz  circuits

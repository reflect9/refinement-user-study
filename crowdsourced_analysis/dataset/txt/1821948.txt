artists helping artists   to the editor:  re ''from a mental hospital, a cinematic mexico'' by kathryn shattuck [jan. 21]:  in retelling how the art of martín ramírez was resurrected, the role of the painter jim nutt was left out. he was teaching and running the art gallery at sacramento state college in 1968 when he found drawings by mr. ramírez in the university's collection. mr. nutt learned they were owned by tarmo pasto, an artist and psychology professor, and with mr. pasto's help mounted an exhibition and later brought the works to the attention of the gallery owner phyllis kind. over the years she showed the art in her chicago gallery and helped inspire artists like me by the great vision and talent of martín ramírez.  john hrehov  fort wayne, ind.  the writer is a professor of painting and drawing at indiana university-purdue university fort wayne.  martÍn ramÍrez

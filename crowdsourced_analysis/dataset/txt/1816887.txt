how to say 'fool'   to the editor:  in his review of florence noiville's biography of isaac bashevis singer (dec. 24), d. t. max quotes from saul bellow's english translation of singer's ''gimpel the fool'': ''i had seven names in all: imbecile, donkey, flax-head, dope, glump, ninny and fool.'' this, he claims, sounds ''more like augie march than someone from the old country,'' and he ''wonders'' about what singer may have thought.  it is surely relevant to note that bellow's english is a close and direct translation of singer's yiddish. the fact is that yiddish speakers in the ''old country'' had plenty of words for fool, and presumably many occasions to use them. singer's seven examples, each well rendered by bellow, far from exhausted the storehouse. if you look in nahum stutchkoff's yiddish thesaurus of 1950, published by yivo, you will find 11 dense columns under the heading ''narishkayt.''  paul needham  summit, n.j.

it's a free market for all   to the editor:  re ''protecting internet democracy'' (editorial, jan. 3):  ''net neutrality'' is an idea that has no place in a free market. cable and phone companies have no obligation to treat all internet traffic equally. if these companies judge it to be in their self-interest to sell speedier delivery to certain content providers, they should be free to do so.  just as fedex and ups are free to charge their customers for faster delivery, so should cable and phone companies.  the idea that cable and phone companies cannot offer superior services to some of their customers is an attack on their freedom. as owners of their networks, they have the right to run their businesses as they see fit.  david holcberg  media research specialist  ayn rand institute  irvine, calif., jan. 3, 2007

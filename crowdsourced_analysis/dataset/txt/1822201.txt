town of oyster bay seeks to develop waterfront plan   the town of oyster bay is beginning a new effort to protect its waterfront, announcing intentions to create a master plan for the eastern waterfront in the hamlet of oyster bay.  using a $37,250 matching grant from the state's environmental protection fund, the town hired a consultant to oversee the plan and appointed a steering committee, composed of representatives from local governments as well as environmental, civic and community groups.  the eastern waterfront includes commercial, residential and town property. the study will address issues like improving public access and establishing connections between downtown and the community; providing easier public access to the waterfront and the theodore roosevelt memorial park and beach; and providing easier access for transient boaters to downtown.  john venditto, the town supervisor, said the plan was ''the last piece of a puzzle'' to protect the area's environmental resources and preserve the community character with sensible economic growth. he said that in the past 10 years the town had received $8.5 million in grants from the state for studies and work on waterfront projects -- a western waterfront plan and an oyster bay hamlet plan.  the western waterfront plan includes a 9/11 memorial park, a new fishing pier and the eventual replacement of two buildings at a shipyard that were razed. the hamlet plan includes new street lighting and paving and redesigned storefronts.  linda saslow  the week

beaches of bangladesh   to the editor: as one who served in the peace corps in bangladesh in 2000-2001, i feel compelled to add a bit of realism to jeff koyen's ''bangladesh: lured by the beach side of a beleaguered land'' (next stop, dec. 24). during my group's service in bangladesh, we trained in cox's bazar, and yes, the beach was beautiful, but two of our group's members were attacked while they walked on the beach. bangladesh is a rough and tumble place. for safety and security reasons, the peace corps no longer has a program there.  don mayer  jeffersonville, vt.

kids play on our behalf   to the editor:  re ''caution: grown-ups at play,'' by stacy schiff (column, jan. 16):  i would extend ms. schiff's contention that we boomer parents are using involvement with our children to return to our own childhoods -- yes, and more.  i also think that many of us are involved so that our children can do the achieving that we haven't. here we are entering our 50s, the well-known period of resignation to disappointment, and here they are entering middle school, and thanks to our pushing opportunity down their throats, they can ace algebra while they're still in sixth grade!  if you're not the best and the brightest, you can become so, through your over-tutored, over-protected, over-guided (and soon to be burnt out) son or daughter.  it's not just that we're going back to the playground -- they're doing our adult achieving for us.  judy karasik  silver spring, md., jan. 17, 2007

small-government ideal   to the editor:  re ''a failed revolution'' (column, dec. 29):  i am flattered that paul krugman took time to read my book ''the freedom revolution,'' but i am not surprised that he continues to fantasize about a big government that works when it is run by enlightened liberals like him.  mr. krugman seems to believe that there are benevolent politicians and bureaucrats who are smarter than the rest of us. these noble servants, uninfluenced by their own interests, can take care of our problems, from education, to health care, to retirement security.  the republican revolution argued that government does not know better. government programs often fail because of pretensions of better knowledge and good intentions. we suggested giving more control back to individuals, and voters agreed. we reformed welfare, cut spending and balanced the budget.  eventually, the revolution ended because many republicans let their own parochial interests, not good policy, govern their behavior.  i was an early critic of mistakes that produced the republican rout last november. but republican failings do not spell the end for small government and personal freedom. support for individual liberty is alive and well with the american people.  make social security and medicare voluntary, and they will show you.  dick armey  washington, jan. 2, 2007  the writer, the former house majority leader, is chairman of freedom works.

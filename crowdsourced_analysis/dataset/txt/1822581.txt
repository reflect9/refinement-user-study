seeking to help those without enough food   to the editor:  ''to food pantry, even fruitcake is a help'' (news article, jan. 26) negates the important role of the emergency food system.  fruitcake, cookies and exotic donations are not what we're about. the food bank for new york city provides nutritional training and a wide range of nutritious food to soup kitchens and food pantries -- most of which is financed by government programs.  the current shortage of food in the system is driven largely by prolonged cuts in government financing, which have led to a dramatic drop in the amount of food provided by government-financed programs in the past five years.  to maintain an adequate supply of nutritious emergency food, an increase in government financing to match existing need and increased private donations of fresh food are vital. but nutritious emergency food is just the first step.  to reach our ultimate goal to end hunger, the food bank and its network of soup kitchens and food pantries promote the enrollment of eligible new yorkers for food stamps and other benefits, as well as the development of permanent access to affordable, nutritious food in low-income neighborhoods.  √Åine duggan  new york, jan. 26, 2007  the writer is vice president of government relations, policy and research at the food bank for new york city.

tracking outsourced bonanzas   the new congress is promising far tighter oversight of bush administration spending programs, and few targets are more in need of scrutiny and daylight than the outsourcing of government programs to private contractors. this highly lucrative world quietly ballooned by 86 percent -- to $377 billion annually -- during the first five years of the bush administration, according to congressional estimates. outsourced spending, on iraq, katrina and other bonanzas, has grown twice as fast as other discretionary spending, according to representative henry waxman, the california democrat who is chairman of the oversight and reform committee.  mr. waxman is fairly itching to finally map the waste, fraud and abuse in private contracting that went largely ignored by the previous republican congress. taxpayers should wish him well.  in a preliminary glimpse, 118 contracts worth $745 billion were found by government auditors to be rife with questionable award procedures, mismanagement, overcharging and skimpy to nonexistent oversight. full inquiries and public hearings are vital if the rich and shadowy world of privatization is ever to be plumbed for the scandal it is nurturing. taxpayers have only a vague notion of what's gone on, mainly through reporting on the fantastic good fortune of halliburton, vice president dick cheney's former company, whose contracts increased a whopping 600 percent across five years as the iraq war costs cascaded. not incidentally, privatization has been a cash cow in stirring campaign donations from successful contractors.  according to one recent audit reported in the washington post, among 49 privatized contracts, three out of five were awarded noncompetitively, lacked oversight, and raised questions of legality. what's been going on out there? this question cries out for an answer from the new congress.

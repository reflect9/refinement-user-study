corrections   an article yesterday about senator jim webb of virginia and his response, for the democratic party, to the state of union address omitted part of a conversation he had with president bush at a white house reception for new members of congress in november. president bush approached mr. webb, whose son is a marine serving in iraq, and asked, ''how's your boy?'' mr. webb replied, ''i'd like to get them out of iraq, mr. president.'' mr. webb did not say at that point in the conversation, ''that's between me and my boy, mr. president.'' mr. webb did not make that statement until after mr. bush had said of the iraq comment: ''that's not what i asked you. how's your boy?''  the article also referred incorrectly to how mr. webb's speech dealt with democrats' response to the president's iraq strategy. the speech did not mention whether the party will go beyond a symbolic resolution denouncing mr. bush's plan to send more troops to baghdad.

bad smells and budgets   michael a. l. balboni, the state's incoming homeland security chief, expressed frustration in a recent interview about the weird smells that permeated some buildings in new york city. he said he planned to ''put people's feet to the fire'' to figure out the source.  ''what if next time it smells like almonds and it turns out to be cyanide?'' said mr. balboni, left.  budget watchers should also take note. mr. balboni said that when he recently presented his preliminary wish list to the budget director, paul francis, he was told things were going to be tight. when he asked how tight, mr. francis said, ''tighter than you've ever seen,'' mr. balboni recalled.  robin finn and danny hakim  albany notebook

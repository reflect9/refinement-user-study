a lawyer's free speech   to the editor:  re ''apology not accepted'' (editorial, jan. 19):  i share your outrage at charles d. stimson's ''loathsome attempt to punish lawyers who represent inmates of the guant√°namo bay internment camp.''  as a lawyer who has often been condemned for representing the despised, i understand how important it is to our legal system that lawyers remain entirely free to choose their clients without fear of governmentally imposed or suggested sanctions.  but i cannot join you in your proposal that the bar disciplinary committee investigate mr. stimson for conduct ''prejudicial to the administration of justice.''  that open-ended criterion was itself misused during the mccarthy period and holds the potential for silencing controversial lawyers.  as an individual lawyer, mr. stimson has the right to express his views without fear of bar discipline.  as a senior pentagon official, a purported representative of the united states government, he should be fired if his views do not reflect that of the government, as i surely hope they do not.  alan dershowitz  cambridge, mass., jan. 19, 2007

online music, then and now   to the editor:  re ''want an iphone? beware the ihandcuffs'' (digital domain, jan. 14), which criticized the use of copy-protection software in apple inc. music systems:  it's easy to forget that only a few years ago, as the music industry waged open war against peer-to-peer file sharing, there were few legal, viable alternatives for downloading music. then apple introduced itunes, which provided not only enough copy-protection software to satisfy a reluctant music industry, but a seamless experience that gave users an easy way to buy and play music and a reasonable degree of freedom. itunes and its relationship to the ipod paved the way for today's online music marketplace.  users of competing music players are free to buy music elsewhere, and they do; however, the ipod's runaway success suggests that much of the digital music audience will accept a few restrictions in exchange for the system's ease of use.  paul ferguson  minneapolis, jan. 16

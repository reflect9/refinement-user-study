the week ahead: jan. 7 - 13; pop/jazz   gerald clayton was a controversial presence at the thelonious monk competition in washington last september: a pianist who had everything he needed to win but innocence. (he came in second.) he's been playing jazz at a professional level for some time -- he's 22, the son of the prominent west coast bassist john clayton -- and knows how to turn on the heat and stun an audience. i've seen him play all kinds of moods and techniques with a number of different bands, but if you have any taste for confident, energetic, almost gilded straight-ahead jazz piano playing that tends toward the optimistic -- much more oscar peterson than thelonious monk -- you'll have to check him out. he plays with his trio on saturday at the jazz gallery. at 9 and 10:30 p.m., 290 hudson street, south village, (212) 242-1063; $15.  with mr. clayton and the 81-year-old drummer-composer-bandleader chico hamilton performing in new york this week, we have a kind of alpha and omega of west coast jazz. mr. hamilton had one of the great innovative los angeles bands in the '50s and '60s; his records back then, like ''man from two worlds'' and ''the dealer,'' had a great, stimulating, modernist idea almost every few bars. he's indefatigable: last year he released four provocative new records on his own label, joyous shout, with guests like the jazz singer bill henderson as well as arthur lee of the rock band love. mr. hamilton couldn't play the charlie parker jazz festival last summer because of an illness, but he's back. thursday at 8 p.m., makor, 35 west 67th street, manhattan, (212) 415-5500; $15.

vegans can have it all   to the editor:  i thoroughly enjoyed ''strict vegan ethics, frosted with hedonism'' (jan. 24) but take issue with the characterization of an animal-free diet as ascetic. the article stated that isa chandra moskowitz ''makes even the deprivations of veganism and the rage of punk seem like fun.''  deprivations? since adopting a vegan diet one year ago, i lost 20 pounds while eating whatever i wanted, have clearer skin at age 34 than at age 10, and went up a bra size while shaving 30 points from my cholesterol count. my husband and i enjoy thai, korean, japanese, caribbean, chinese, mexican, italian and ethiopian cuisine, and cook at home more often and more creatively than before.  i am, however, depriving myself of the growth hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, arsenic, prions and fecal matter present in factory-farmed meat.  devery doleman  brooklyn  to the editor:  it is frustrating when people say that a lot of vegan food is awful. it's not because it's vegan that it tastes awful, but because it's a bad recipe or because the person can't cook. i have no shortage of memories from my omnivorous days of terrible meals made with animal products.  fine vegan food is filled with not only rich, vibrant flavor, but also with a peacefulness that comes from its cruelty-free, compassionate foundation.  janice iannelli  lincoln park, n.j.  to the editor:  your writer states that omnivores are ''meat-and-dairy eaters,'' but this obscures the fact that vegans, too, are omnivores by nature. the article underemphasized what we should most admire about vegans, namely, that their eating habits reflect a moral choice to minimize harm to the world around them, particularly to animals. furthermore, ms. moskowitz states that omnivores ''can't imagine baking without eggs and butter.'' i, however, am a conscientious omnivore who simply can't imagine baking.  karin j. lauria  marlborough, mass.

a waning influence   to the editor:  re ''indie rock's patron saint inspires a new flock'' by will hermes [jan. 14]:  it seem to me that any pop musician who progresses beyond the one-hit wonder stage will eventually influence a small group of musicians in the following generation. david byrne is no exception. i was a great fan of the talking heads in their day. but mr. byrne's solo career has been less than gripping. when he comments about not seeing anyone of his own generation taking in concerts and adds that maybe they are home watching ''desperate housewives,'' i couldn't help but smile. if that's where they are, they are probably learning more about their culture than by watching mr. byrne's many dabblings.  mark cromwell  san francisco  david byrne

friendly rivals, part ii   the political odd couples are not only on the democratic side of the nassau state senate race.  the republican candidate, maureen o'connell, recently wrote a letter to governor spitzer urging him to support a nassau county democrat, assemblyman thomas p. dinapoli, below, for state comptroller.  ''as the taxpayers' advocate, the state comptroller must possess independence and integrity,'' ms. o'connell wrote in the letter, which was also published in a local newspaper. ''assemblyman dinapoli personifies these traits and, through his lifetime of public service, he has earned the public's trust.''  mr. dinapoli is one of at least 18 people -- lawmakers, current or former officials and businessmen -- seeking to replace the former comptroller, alan g. hevesi, who resigned after pleading guilty to a felony for using a state worker to chauffeur his wife.  ms. o'connell, who is running in a district where registered democrats now outnumber registered republicans, said in an interview that she had not yet run into any republicans who were miffed that she would back a democrat for the high-profile office.  since democrats will have the upper hand in choosing the next comptroller, few republicans expressed any interest in the race -- with one exception being andrew s. eristoff, a commissioner of tax and finance in the pataki administration.  ''the reason i wrote the letter is because i've known tom dinapoli for a long time,'' ms. o'connell, herself a former assemblywoman from the area, said in an interview. ''i think he's the right person for the job. he's a man of character and integrity and honesty.''  nicholas confessore  albany notebook

arts, briefly; italy recovers rare marbles   the italian government said yesterday that police investigators had tracked down a rare group of first century b.c. marble panels that had been illegally excavated and offered to museums and private collectors. the 12 panels, a detail from one shown above, depict gladiators in combat and were found about two weeks ago in the garden of a private home 25 miles north of rome, a government prosecutor, paolo ferri, said at a news conference. that the thieves did not succeed in selling them suggests that the market in ancient antiquities has largely dried up, he said. he credited italy's tougher stance in dealing with those who loot antiquities, including prosecutions he has led recently in rome, like the current trial of a former j. paul getty museum curator. mr. ferri declined to give further details on the case, saying an investigation was under way; he did say that dealers already under investigation for such trafficking were involved. anna maria moretti, a state superintendent for antiquities, said the panels would be on display at the national etruscan museum after they were restored.  elisabetta povoled

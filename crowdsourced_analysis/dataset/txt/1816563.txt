arts, briefly; eakins painting on display   thomas jefferson university in philadelphia has agreed to lend the philadelphia museum of art ''the gross clinic,'' its prized 1875 thomas eakins painting, above, which the museum is raising funds to buy in a collaboration with the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts. it will go on view at 4 p.m. today. ''it's a thank you to donors who have already given and an inspiration for future gifts,'' said anne d'harnoncourt, the museum's director. she said that more than half the $68 million needed to buy the painting had been raised. late last month the museum and the academy announced that they would match the price that the national gallery of art in washington and the crystal bridges museum of american art in bentonville, ark., had agreed to pay unless a local institution would pay an equal amount. the work will remain on view at the museum until early spring, when it will move to the academy.  carol vogel

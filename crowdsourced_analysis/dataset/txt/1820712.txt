critics' choice: new cds   of montreal  ''hissing fauna, are you the destroyer?'' (polyvinyl)  kevin barnes, the songwriter behind of montreal, would be the first to admit that he thinks too much. ''i fell in love with the first cute girl that i met,'' he sings like a pop songwriter. but then he adds, ''who could appreciate georges bataille,'' the morbidly erotic writer who once declared, ''to become delightful happiness must be tainted with poison.''  of montreal arrived in the 1990s as part of the elephant 6 collective of psychedelia-loving pop experimenters in georgia. over the last decade of montreal has been a band and a one-man studio concoction, and mr. barnes has revealed himself not as a whimsical hippie, but as a character grappling with doubt and despondency. he moved with his wife and child to norway in 2004, and ''hissing fauna, are you the destroyer?'' is a chronicle of isolation, bitter lovers' quarrels and borderline breakdowns: ''daytime i'm so absent-minded, nighttime meeting new anxieties/so am i erasing myself?,'' he sings in ''gronlandic edit.''  this time of montreal's music revolves around a staple of loners in studios: synthesizers, used mostly for synth-pop that looks back to the 1970s and 1980s but is warped with shifty structures and skipped beats that could trip up unwary dancers. the album's centerpiece is the 12-minute ''the past is a grotesque animal,'' pulsating steadily in a spiral of self-laceration. manic pop and depressive revelations have rarely been so closely bonded.  jon pareles

editors' note   a front-page article on jan. 5 about the tendency of criminal suspects in new york city to give revealing and usually damaging statements to the police, despite their right to remain silent, included excerpts from the statement of james barbour, a broadway actor accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. according to his statement, mr. barbour told the police that he had lain on a bed with the girl and that they had kissed.  but the article should have made it clear that in the statement, mr. barbour does not admit or confess to having sexually assaulted the girl, and that he has pleaded not guilty.

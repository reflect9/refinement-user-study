antidepressant linked to fractures in older people   daily use of a common class of antidepressant may double the risk of fracture in people older than 50, a canadian study reports.  researchers randomly selected 5,008 people older than 50 and followed them for five years. at the start of the study, they interviewed the subjects about medications and general health. the subjects filled out yearly questionnaires reporting fractures caused by falling from a bed, chair or standing height. (a co-author of the study has received grants and honorariums from several drug companies.)  one hundred and thirty-seven people, or 2.7 percent of the subjects, were daily users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or s.s.r.i.'s, a rate similar to that of the general populations of the united states and canada. after controlling for the use of other psychotropic medicines, age, sex, education, height, weight, smoking status and other variables, daily users of s.s.r.i.'s were 2.1 times as likely to suffer fractures as those who did not use the medicine. the study  appears in the jan. 22 issue of the archives of internal medicine.  ''we're not recommending that people stop their s.s.r.i.'s,'' said dr. david goltzman, a professor of medicine at mcgill university in montreal and the senior author of the study. ''but people should realize that this is a risk and that they might want to undertake lifestyle changes like participating in exercise and making sure their diet is appropriate in calcium and vitamin d.''  using s.s.r.i.'s was also associated with an increased risk of falls and with decreased mineral bone density. but after controlling for falls and low bone density, the risk of fracture persisted. the scientists speculated that other pathways leading to impaired bone quality might be at work.  vital signs: hazards

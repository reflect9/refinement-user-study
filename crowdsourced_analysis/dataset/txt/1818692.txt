asking too much   to the editor:  re ''a prince on flute and a count on guitar'' [jan. 7]:  anthony tommasini is right in imagining the benefits of having count almaviva accompany himself: antonino siragusa strummed a guitar in the opera company of philadelphia's ''barbiere di siviglia,'' and the effect was electric. few singers can boast the attainments (liszt-praised pianism, command of the violin) of marcella sembrich, the heroine of the met's first ''i puritani.'' as for the met's current ''puritani,'' rather than taking up instruments, the singers should concentrate on the rudiments of bel canto singing, like staying in tune.  david shengold  philadelphia  singer-musicians

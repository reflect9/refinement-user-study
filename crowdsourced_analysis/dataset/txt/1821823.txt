corrections   a chart yesterday with an article about declining union membership gave outdated information on the states with the highest and lowest membership in 2006. the top states were hawaii (24.7%), new york (24.4%), alaska (22.2%), new jersey (20.1%) and washington (19.8%); the bottom states were texas (4.9%), georgia (4.4%), virginia (4.0%), and north and south carolina (both with 3.3%). the chart listed the 2005 rankings. (as the article noted correctly, the national average is 12 percent, based on 2006 figures.)

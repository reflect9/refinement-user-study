the week ahead: jan. 28 - feb. 3; television   the high priestess of sophisticated raunch, sarah silverman (''jesus is magic,'' ''the aristocrats''), plays a character named -- that's right -- sarah silverman in her new comedy central series, ''the sarah silverman program.'' in the manner of ''curb your enthusiasm'' the show follows her real-fake character as she goes about her daily life. but ms. silverman's life won't feel all that run-of-the-mill to anyone whose regular interactions don't involve homeless people and children entering beauty pageants. grounding things in quasi reality is the presence of a sister, played by the star's real-life sibling laura silverman. friday at 10:30 p.m.  ''the valley of light,'' a ''hallmark hall of fame'' television movie, adapts a novel by terry kaye that explores love, hope, serendipity and things spiritual as it verges toward ''bridges of madison county'' territory. the drama centers on a world war ii veteran (chris klein) who returns home to find his family life ruined. his parents are dead, his brother is in jail, and he has lost his ancestral farm. but life isn't as grim as it seems. drifting about the south leads him to an intriguing stranger, and to an attractive widow (gretchen mol). not for the snarky or pessimistically inclined. sunday at 9 p.m. on cbs.  ''what remains: the life and work of sally mann,'' on cinemax, explores the cultural impact of a photographer whose provocative early pictures of children drew controversy. wednesday at 7 p.m.

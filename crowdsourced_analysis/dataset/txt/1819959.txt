corrections   an obituary on jan. 11 by the new york times regional newspapers about james c. weeks, a former president and chief operating officer of the new york times regional media group, incorrectly described his postgraduate education. he was a graduate of the program for management development at the harvard business school -- not a recipient of a master's degree in marketing from the university of florida, where he earned his undergraduate degree. the obituary also misspelled the given name of his wife. she is toney weeks, not toni.

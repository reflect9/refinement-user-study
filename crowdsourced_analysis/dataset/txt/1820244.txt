the week ahead: jan. 21 - 27; pop/jazz   audition night goes international, eclectic and often danceable at globalfest. the event started in 2004 as a world-music showcase for concert bookers gathered at the annual conference of the association of performing arts promoters, and it has outgrown its initial home at the public theater. this year it moves to webster hall, so there's room for a general audience. a dozen acts are in the lineup, each offering a different perspective on how the traditional meets the present. lenine, one of brazil's most beloved songwriters, will play an acoustic set that's likely to merge the maracatu rhythms of recife with his own gift for melody. sara tavares draws on the afro-portuguese rhythms of the cape verde islands, while andy palacio and the garifuna collective play african-rooted music from central america. lila downs carries the husky drama of mexican tradition into songs addressed to both sides of the border. and lucia pulido, a colombian singer based in new york, leads palenque, which weaves jazzy accompaniments around traditional songs.  dengue fever is a los angeles band with a cambodian lead singer and a taste for 1960s psychedelic rock from both california and asia. boom pan, an israeli trio of guitar, tuba and percussion, delivers modal melodies with the twangy reverb of surf guitar. julia sarr, a singer from senegal, and patrice larose, a guitarist from france, mingle african vamps, french pop and a touch of flamenco.  a french contingent also includes the peppy babylon circus, which connects the horns and oompah of ska to accordion-driven cabaret, big-band swing and some political thoughts; les primitifs du futur, playing jazzy songs that echo the 1920s and 1930s; and le trio joubran, palestinian brothers who adapt middle eastern classical pieces for the oud. american tradition is also on the bill with the carolina chocolate drops, a string band revitalizing the african-american roots of old-timey music from the piedmont. sunday night at 6, 125 east 11th street, east village, (212) 353-1600; $40.

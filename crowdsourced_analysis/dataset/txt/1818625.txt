surfacing | los angeles; where stars are in the kitchen   fancy restaurants in los angeles often serve as celebrity staging grounds. on la cienega, the city's unofficial restaurant row, the valets look as overworked as the waiters inside, as hummers line up to deposit their paparazzi-ready passengers in front of overhyped restaurants like koi and republic.  but just to the east, a quiet stretch of beverly boulevard is reinventing the los angeles dining scene. in the last few years, this street -- along with the parallel thoroughfares of melrose avenue and third street -- has become the foodie center of los angeles, home to the up-and-coming chefs whose modest restaurants are single-handedly raising the city's culinary reputation.  ''we set out specifically not to be a celebrity restaurant -- not a burning-hot pan, but a gentle simmer,'' said neal fraser, a chef who helped pioneer this alternative restaurant row. ''los angeles has had too many of those places, and not enough little jewels in small neighborhoods.''  when mr. fraser arrived in the neighborhood 10 years ago, the wide boulevard was a culinary no man's land, a heavily orthodox jewish neighborhood known as the fairfax district. that started to change in 1995 with his first restaurant, boxer (since closed), and continues with bld (7450 beverly boulevard, 323-930-9744; www.bldrestaurant.com), where diners line the counter on red bar stools to wash down artisanal salumi ($5 and up) with a glass of wine, and grace (7360 beverly boulevard, 323-934-4400; www.gracerestaurant.com). grace's casual-chic décor, like its menu, is more farmer's market than fussy, and features dishes like grilled tenderloin of wild boar with violet mustard sauce ($34).  in more recent years, as more of the city's innovative young chefs arrived, the local phone book has begun to read like a james beard nominee list.  hatfield's, the seven-month-old endeavor of the husband-and-wife team of quinn and karen hatfield (7458 beverly boulevard, 323-935-2977; www.hatfieldsrestaurant.com), epitomizes the district's focus on organic ingredients. the restaurant is a study in minimalism, a tiny box with bare walls and concrete floors. it's the food that stands out, with a market-driven menu that might include a starter of charred japanese octopus with roasted fennel ($14) or an entree of date- and mint-crusted lamb with potato chive purée ($36). ''it's not the hyperglamorous places people are used to eating in l.a.,'' ms. hatfield said. ''you have to be open-minded about food.''  in other words, don't expect tabloid photographers in front of angelini osteria (7313 beverly boulevard, 323-297-0070; www.angeliniosteria.com), the cozy italian restaurant run by the chef gino angelini. nor will you find them next door at ita-cho (7311 beverly boulevard, 323-938-9009), a japanese restaurant that doesn't serve sushi, but izakaya (japanese tapas) dishes like braised lotus root and shishito peppers.  the food at jar (8225 beverly boulevard, 323-655-6566; www.thejar.com) may look familiar: upscale home cooking like crab deviled eggs ($9) and kansas city steak with béarnaise ($39). but the décor (1950s office) and clientele (young musicians to lawyers) aren't standard steakhouse.  as beverly boulevard has flourished, so have the surrounding streets. at a corner off melrose avenue, nancy silverton and mario batali have fired up the ovens of their epicurean pizzeria, mozza (641 north highland avenue, 323 297-0101; www.mozza-la.com). just up the block on melrose is michael cimarusti's providence (5955 melrose avenue, 323-460-4170; www.providencela.com), one of the hottest restaurants in los angeles right now. and third street is home to a.o.c. (8022 west third street, 323-653-6359; www.aocwinebarcom), suzanne goin's wildly popular wine bar.  these restaurants may not be patrolled by paparazzi, but the chefs inside are becoming celebrities in their own right.  surfacing

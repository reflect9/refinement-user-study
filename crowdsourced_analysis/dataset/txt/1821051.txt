e-zpass for passports?   to the editor:  re ''scrambling to get hold of a passport'' (business day, jan. 23):  if the government were functional, it would set up temporary passport-application bureaus in airports, so people could apply on their way out of the country, or coming back in.  why shouldn't the government go where the business is?  jay m. pasachoff  williamstown, mass., jan. 23, 2007

light a bulb, save earth   to the editor:  re ''incandescence, yes. fluorescence, we'll see'' (week in review, jan. 7):  we can all agree that the light cast by compact fluorescent light bulbs is not as pleasing as that of incandescent bulbs.  unfortunately, the aesthetics of deforestation, coastal erosion, drought, wildfires, shrinking glaciers, mosquito-borne diseases and species dying off is worse.  sam montgomery  los angeles, jan. 8, 2007

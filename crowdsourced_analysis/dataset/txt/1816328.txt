hussein poem: baathists bloom, enemy is hollow   following is the first half of a poem attributed to saddam hussein, as transcribed and translated by the new york times from a reading by his cousin muayed dhamin al-hazza.  unbind it  unbind your soul. it is my soul mate and you are my soul's beloved.  no house could have sheltered my heart as you have  if i were that house, you would be its dew  you are the soothing breeze  my soul is made fresh by you  and our baath party blossoms like a branch turns green.  the medicine does not cure the ailing but the white rose does.  the enemies set their plans and traps  and proceeded despite the fact they are all faulty.  it is a plan of arrogance and emptiness  it will prove to be nothing but defeated  we break it as rust devours steel  like a sinner consumed by his sins  we never felt weak  we were made strong by our morals.  our honorable stand, the companion of our soul,  the enemies forced strangers into our sea  and he who serves them will be made to weep.  here we unveil our chests to the wolves  and will not tremble before the beast.  we fight the most difficult challenges  and beat them back, god willing.  how would they fare under such strains?  all people, we never let you down  and in catastrophes, our party is the leader.  i sacrifice my soul for you and for our nation  blood is cheap in hard times  we never kneel or bend when attacking  but we even treat our enemy with honor.  the struggle for iraq

gluten-free food   to the editor:  your article included the phrase ''gluten free'' as if it, too, was one of those meaningless phrases meant to make people believe they're buying a healthier, more ''natural'' product. i have a son with celiac disease, which is an auto-immune disease that causes the intestines to destroy themselves if gluten is ingested. seeing the words ''gluten free'' on packaging thrills me: it means i can safely buy it and serve it to my son without having to read all the ingredients and check with the manufacturer.  claire lazebnik  pacific palisades, calif.

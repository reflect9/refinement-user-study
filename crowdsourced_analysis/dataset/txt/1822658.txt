corrections   a classical music entry in the listings pages of weekend on jan. 19 misstated the history of the performance in new york of ''il signor bruschino,'' by rossini, which the gotham chamber orchestra is performing through saturday. the gotham chamber orchestra's production is the first professional staging of the work in new york since 1933, not the first staging since then. (the error was repeated in a week ahead entry in arts & leisure on jan. 21, in the listings pages of weekend on friday and in a review of a performance on saturday.)

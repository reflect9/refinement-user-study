a different tack   abject capitulation or tactical retreat? how to interpret the shaw group's reaction to shareholder complaints over the potential severance package for its founder and chief executive, james m. bernhard jr.?  after protests by the california public employees' retirement system, which estimated that mr. bernhard's 10-year employment contract committed the company to giving him a golden parachute worth as much as $100 million, the company shortened the pact to just three years.  calpers had blasted shaw, a construction and engineering company in baton rouge, la., saying it had ''some of the most egregious severance and change-of-control provisions ever,'' and urged fellow shareholders to cap severance packages at three times an employee's salary and bonus without explicit shareholder approval.  while shaw's board opposes the proposal, which will be put to a vote of shareholders on jan. 30, its move to shorten mr. bernhard's contract effectively cut his severance pay to three times his salary and bonus.  a shaw spokesman, christopher d. sammons, declined to provide figures, but calpers estimated that the exit pay could drop below $10 million.  elizabeth olson  openers: suits

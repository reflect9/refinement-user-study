corrections   an obituary on jan. 14 about a. i. bezzerides, who wrote several novels that were adapted for films, omitted part of the title of one film and misidentified its director. the title is ''on dangerous ground,'' not ''dangerous ground,'' and the director was nicholas ray, not james dassin.

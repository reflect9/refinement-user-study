odd dish for a diet   as former gov. mike huckabee of arkansas heads to iowa this week in his quest for the republican presidential nomination, one piece of his platform may be unique: his weight loss.  he chronicled his path to healthier living, and how he lost 120 pounds, in his book, ''quit digging your grave with a knife and fork.'' while promoting policy, mr. huckabee often mentions how he managed to swear off the staples of deep-fried southern cooking.  but before leaving office, he and his wife, janet, sent out a ''farewell arkansas'' card that featured a bean dish from ms. huckabee's holiday collection. the recipe, though, may stray from his talking points.  green bean bundles  2 cans whole green beans  1 pound bacon  1 cup brown sugar  1/4 cup of butter  3 tsp. garlic salt  drain beans and make bundles of 4 or 5. cut a piece of bacon in half and wrap around each bundle. place bundles in baking dish. melt last three ingredients in saucepan and pour over bundles. bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes or until bacon seems done.  jeff zeleny  political action: fun

lollygags and sidereal days   to the editor:  re ''making sense of time, earthbound and otherwise'' (jan. 23): there is an important ambiguity in the facts that natalie angier presents in her otherwise excellent article: that our planet twirls on its axis every 24 hours and so gives us our days.  in fact, the earth twirls once on its axis every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds (approximately). this so-called sidereal day measures the rotation of the earth with respect to the stars. because of the earth's movement in its orbit of the sun, an additional (approximately) 4 minutes is needed for the sun to reach an overhead position, the so-called 24-hour solar day.  the basic concept of sidereal and solar days is far more relevant and understandable by the lay reader than the more complex measures of time that ms. angier presents.  richard w. paulson  st. michaels, md.  to the editor:  i was brought up short by natalie angier's first column. in heaven's name, what are ''chasmic lollygags'' and ''tweener timed life forms?'' and why use ''changing annum(s)'' and ''universal tockers'' when simpler, clearer phrases would do? this too-cute language almost discouraged me from reading what ultimately became an informative story.  gerald t. perkoff, m.d.  sanibel, fla.

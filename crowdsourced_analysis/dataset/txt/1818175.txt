the listings: jan. 12 - jan. 18; ace in the hole   etched in acid and steeped in bile, ''ace in the hole'' (1951) was the first film billy wilder directed after his breakup with his longtime screenwriting partner, charles brackett. in fall 1949 wilder was finishing up his final collaboration with mr. brackett, ''sunset boulevard,'' when a 20-year-old radio writer named walter newman pitched him a story about a cave accident and a cynical reporter. the next summer wilder was shooting more or less that same story in and around albuquerque with kirk douglas, above left, a stellar supporting cast (including a sensationally vulgar jan sterling) and more than a thousand extras. mr. douglas, spitting zingers as if they were bullets, plays chuck tatum, an east coast newsman who has run out of luck but not steam. he talks his way into a job with the local paper, where he languishes until he gets his big break in the form of leo minosa (richard benedict, above right), an everyman pinned in a cave inside an indian cliff dwelling. leo becomes chuck's ticket back to the big-headlines time, his titular ace in the hole, as well as entertainment for hordes of gawkers. wilder was justly fond of ''ace in the hole,'' but the film flopped with critics and audiences who clearly didn't appreciate the unflattering mirror image he was holding up to them with such wicked glee. paramount studios renamed the film ''the big carnival,'' which did nothing but tick off its director. the newly restored print at film forum reinstates the original title and lets you see just how nimbly wilder corralled all those itty-bitty locusts on the big screen.

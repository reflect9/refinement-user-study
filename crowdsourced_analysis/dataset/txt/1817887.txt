outfoxed by sara lee   to the editor:  after reading ''be it ever so homespun, there's nothing like spin'' (jan. 3), i learn i'm susceptible to ''easy'' and ''green'' so-called identifiers. just yesterday, i thought i was a ''green-elite'' food consumer, exercising her prowess before the bread display at whole foods. opting against hearth-baked beauties that ran $4 and up, i grabbed a stone-ground whole-wheat loaf from the bottom row for about $3.  later, i scanned my receipt and saw sara lee on the list. after wading through illustrations of wheat bundles and old-homey type hovering over fields of green, i found the mega-corporation's name printed oh-so discreetly on the loaf's packaging. i've been greenwashed!  diane richard  minneapolis, minn.

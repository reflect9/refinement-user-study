ford interceptor is a brute you could love   introduced on sunday: ford interceptor design study  is it real? only the attitude. ford is pulling on a muscle shirt to see how it would look on some future model.  what's the point? the chrysler 300's triumph -- as a swaggering, stretch-your-legs american sedan -- has detroit competitors wondering why they didn't do it first.  what they said: ''we've been itching to do a rear-drive sedan that speaks to the quintessential muscle cars of the '60s,'' j mays, ford's chief creative officer, said.  what they didn't say: built on a stretched mustang platform, the interceptor is another fashion-plate four-door coupe, featuring the sort of low-rise roof normally reserved for two-door models.  what makes it tick? a 5-liter race-tuned version of the mustang's 4.6-liter v-8, with 400 horsepower.  how much, how soon? ford has floated a number of these stanley kowalski specials in recent years (remember the 427?) but none has made it out of committee. but some of the styling themes seem bound for the production line.  how's it look? apart from what appears to be a viking stove mounted up front -- a cue from last year's super chief concept pickup -- the interceptor is appropriately menacing, a car you don't want to see behind you in a dark alley. the cabin has more black leather than a dominatrix convention.

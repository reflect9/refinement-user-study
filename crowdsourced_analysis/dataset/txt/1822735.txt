all-american day, all-american game, spanish treats   as a change of pace from pizza for a super bowl party, consider a spanish tortilla. it's nothing like the mexican flatbread of the same name, but is closely related to an italian frittata, a thick round omelet layered with potatoes and onions. in spain it is a tapas bar staple, served either warmed or at room temperature.  though a good tortilla is not difficult to prepare, to simplify feeding a crowd there are now frozen ones. the el forno brand from spain, which is sold at agata & valentina, comes in a nine-inch size that will serve six to eight ($10.99), and with spinach or peppers in a seven-inch size to serve four ($9.99). the tortillas take 10 minutes to heat in a microwave or conventional oven or in a skillet with a cover. sangria anyone?  food stuff

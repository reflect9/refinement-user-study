my face, my frizz   to the editor:  re ''taming frizz and setting curls free'' (thursday styles, jan. 18):  for an awful lot of us in the frizzy hair club, my guess is the issue isn't our hair per se, but our facial features and complexions. for some aesthetic reason, angles (that is, straight hair) against a bulbous nose or blemished face draw attention away from the ''problem area'' while curls amplify it.  my suggestion, after years of trying to straighten a whole head of hair, is to just pay attention to the part that frames your face and be done with it.  barbara goodman shovers  toledo, ohio, jan. 18, 2007

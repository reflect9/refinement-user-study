island within an island   some blocks of manhattan give the impression that, say, italian food is everywhere. then there are pockets like the small japanese restaurant scene around second and third avenues in the 40s, a short walk from the united nations for visitors, immigrants and anyone else craving sushi, noodles, grilled meat and fish.  aburiya kinnosuke  * [rating: one star]  (212) 867-5454; 213 east 45th street (third avenue); $$$; review: 11/16/05.  aburiya kinnosuke's tables are usually filled with japanese businessmen with banquets of food in front of them and broad smiles on their faces.  the menu is divided into many parts, including house-made tofu, salads, sashimi, and rice and noodle dishes. but grilling occupies center stage. under the heading ''shichirin grill,'' the restaurant serves meat and fish that diners can grill over bincho-tan charcoal, which produces little smoke.  riingo  ** [rating: two stars]  (212) 867-4200; 205 east 45th street (third avenue); $$$; review: 3/10/04.  riingo is a warren of sleek red and black rooms, each more enticing than the last. the menu is a synthesis of many cuisines, emphasizing japanese.  the conventional sushi, like yellowtail and fluke, is excellent, but it is impossible to pass up selections like tuna foie gras, smoked char and rice-puff-crusted shrimp.  sakagura  (212) 953-7253; 211 east 43rd street (third avenue); $; $25 and under: 6/21/06.  this restaurant, hidden away in the basement of a midtown office building, lures enthusiasts to its subterranean locale with its expansive sake list of more than 200 bottles. the sprawling multipage menu offers cleanly executed dishes meant to accompany the sake, including standards like boiled edamame, and the filling rice balls called onigiri that you would expect at any izakaya, or japanese pub.  sushi yasuda  *** [rating: three stars]  (212) 972-1001; 204 east 43rd street (third avenue); $$$$; review 3/1/00.  the mood is quiet, contemplative, austere. but sushi yasuda has a lot of downtown in its soul. the exemplary service is open and friendly.  at the same time, the menu is dead serious, a purist's paradise of multiple choices among fish species -- nearly 40, a startling number for a small restaurant -- and elegantly presented appetizers and side dishes.  tsukushi  (212) 599-8888; 300 east 41st street (second avenue); $; $25 and under: 5/11/05.  the first time you make a reservation at tsukushi -- and reservations are all but necessary to ensure you'll get a table or a berth at the bar -- the woman on the other end of the line will let you know that there's no menu, that everything is omakase, chef's choice. fortunately the chef, norihiko manabe, has a real talent for orchestrating a meal.  good eating/east 40s e-mail: eating@nytimes.com

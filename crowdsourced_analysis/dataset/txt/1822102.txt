enron epilogue   after three years in federal prison and four months of home confinement, ben f. glisan jr., the first enron executive to go to jail for participating in the fraud that destroyed the energy company, is a free man again.  but free to do what?  reached at his home last week, mr. glisan politely declined to comment on his plans.  his job prospects are undoubtedly tough. ''he can kiss the idea of having a similar role in a public company,'' said john c. lamar, managing director of the alexander group, an executive search firm based in houston.  private companies, mr. lamar added, might be more likely to consider applicants with dodgy backgrounds.  mr. glisan, the former treasurer, pleaded guilty in 2003 and received a maximum sentence of five years in prison after refusing to cooperate with prosecutors. he later helped prosecutors by testifying against his former bosses, jeffrey k. skilling, who was chief executive, and kenneth l. lay, who was chairman.  the jurors in that trial said the attractive and forthright mr. glisan was the government's most effective witness.  whatever his ambition, mr. glisan might want to look for employment outside of houston. ''it was such a soap opera here,'' mr. lamar said of the enron collapse, investigation and trials. ''the passage of time has helped, but a lot of people will never get over it.''  kate murphy  openers: suits

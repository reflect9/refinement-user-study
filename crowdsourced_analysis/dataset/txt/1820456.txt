corrections   an article last sunday about a surge in attendance at the american museum of natural history since the release of the film ''night at the museum'' referred incorrectly to an artifact at the museum. the museum has a cast of bones from the peking man fossils -- not an actual skull of a peking man. most of the peking man fossils were lost during world war ii.

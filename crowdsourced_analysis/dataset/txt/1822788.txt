expert parking   to the editor:  as one who has ''sliced the bread'' and ''broken the matzo'' many times, i applaud calvin trillin's brilliant ''park, he said'' (op-ed, jan. 26), about parallel parking.  i've been obsessed with the subject since i first learned to park behind the wheel of a 1979 manual-shift dodge aspen station wagon.  i'd like to share with mr. trillin another uniquely new york maneuver that i've termed -- ''rocking the baby to sleep.'' in this case, once parked, the car's bumpers are pressed directly against both the vehicle in front and behind, leaving not even enough space to slide a piece of paper between.  it requires a gentle push, and a back and forth rocking motion that when executed properly does not leave a scratch on either bumper.  it's not, however, for the faint of heart and should be exercised only under extreme duress -- say 45 minutes into looking for a free space.  noah samton  new york, jan. 26, 2007  to the editor:  if, as calvin trillin suspects, lexus's advanced parking guidance system spawns a generation of self-parking one-upmanship among competing manufacturers, let's just hope that it never gets to the point where an antagonistic vehicle activates its own auto defense system and mimics the driver's baser nature by resorting to violence to secure that all-too-rare spot.  kevin moss  lafayette, calif., jan. 26, 2007

the cost of medical advances   to the editor:  i think ''so many advances in medicine, so many yet to come'' (dec. 26) precisely describes the infamous ''law of unintended consequences'' in the 21st century.  for example, huge life-expectancy increases necessarily require substantial late-life health care expenditures. would that money benefit society more if invested in our children (18 percent are chronically hungry and have no assured health care; schools have leaky roofs and a chronic shortage of textbooks and qualified teachers)?  internationally, i wonder if population-increasing technologies (eradication of diseases, chemical controls for malaria, etc.) in already-overpopulated areas condemn future generations of humans and other species to ever-lower standards of living on an earth with finite resources. more humans equals exhausted soils, climate-changing resource consumption, and war.  an accurate cost-benefit study might be very enlightening. in a world of 6.5 billion humans and rapid climate change, technologies that increase longevity and total populations are certainly ethically questionable, if not clearly immoral.  kirk s. nevin  corvallis, ore.

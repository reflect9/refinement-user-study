corrections   an article in the special education life section last sunday about the large percentage of asian students at the university of california, berkeley, attributed an erroneous distinction to the state. hawaii -- not california -- was the first state without a racial majority.  also, an article about financial aid for graduate students misstated eligibility for federal plus loans. graduate students may indeed apply for the loans; they became eligible in july 2006.  and an article about rigorous high schools misstated the student newspaper job held by prateek kumar of phillips academy, who talked about his challenging courses. mr. kumar is deputy managing editor of the phillipian, not the top editor. (stephen s. blackman is the editor in chief.)

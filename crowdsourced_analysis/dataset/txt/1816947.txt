corrections   an article on dec. 24 about visiting washington, d.c., in winter misstated the hours and holiday closings for three museums. the national portrait gallery and the smithsonian american art museum are open from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily -- not until 9 p.m. on thursdays and fridays. they close only one day a year -- on dec. 25; they do not close on dec. 24, 25 and 26. the national gallery of art closes each year on dec. 25 and jan. 1, not just on christmas day.

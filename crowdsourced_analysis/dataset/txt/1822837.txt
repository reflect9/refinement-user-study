corrections   an obituary on dec. 18 about herbert gursky, an astrophysicist who studied the sources of x-rays from outside the solar system, referred imprecisely to some of these sources. a distant star he discovered is in the constellation scorpius, not scorpio, and the star was designated scorpius x-1, not just scorpius. the first recorded example of a black hole, which he and others discovered in 1971, was designated cygnus x-1 or cygnus xr-1 -- not just cygnus. the errors were pointed out on dec. 19 in an e-mail message that was misdirected within the times. the correction was further delayed for research.

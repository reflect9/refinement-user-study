new from chrysler and dodge: boxier boxes   introduced on sunday: 2008 chrysler town & country and dodge caravan minivans  is it real? these boxy-looking new minivans are the long-awaited fifth generation production models. really.  what's the point? though sales are fading quickly, minivans are still relatively big sellers at the chrysler group, which essentially invented the segment 24 years ago.  what they said: in a poke at ford and general motors, thomas w. lasorda, chief executive of the chrysler group, said, ''if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen -- we're about to turn up the heat in the minivan kitchen.''  what they didn't say: the minivan segment has never really recovered from chrysler's killing of plymouth and the very popular voyager minivan in 2001. minivan-based crossovers are the next big thing.  what makes it tick? either a 3.3-liter flexible-fuel v-6 bolted to a four-speed automatic transmission, or choices of a 3.8- or a 4.0-liter v-6 (with 240 horsepower) coupled to a minivan-first six-speed automatic.  how much, how soon? the new minivans should start around $20,000 and top out at $40,000 loaded (with geegaws like swiveling seats, plug-in tables and two separate dvd systems) when they appear this fall as '08 models.  how's it look? the interiors are high-tech and very entertaining. the exteriors? yawn.  first glance

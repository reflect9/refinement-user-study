revising laws for sex offenders   to the editor:  ''false security on sex offenders'' (editorial, jan. 14) raises two legitimate concerns, both of which highlight the increasing need for a state civil commitment law.  the first claim states that simply restricting convicted sex offenders' range of motion will not reduce the rate of recidivism.  sex crimes are considered especially heinous not only because of the injuries sustained by survivors but also because of the psychologically complex nature of the offense. the purpose of civil commitment is to better protect the public from those most likely to offend again by evaluating them before being released back into society.  the second claim, that the law is symbolic rather than practical, raises the issue of enforcement. mandates made by small legislative bodies are tantamount to a recommendation. they place an undue burden on local officials to enforce what is essentially a superficial solution to a profound social ill.  sexual violence, be it against a minor or an adult, is a crime that we as a society cannot afford to have on our conscience. therefore new york state must adopt a civil commitment law now. the real sham is that we haven't done it sooner.  jeffrey d. klein  the bronx  the writer is deputy minority leader, new york state senate.

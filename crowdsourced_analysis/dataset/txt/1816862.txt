too much information?   to ease the trauma of filling in the same blanks over and over, the common application -- a four-page form that asks for basic information and a 250- to 500-word essay -- was created. but even common app colleges want to get their two cents in, so they make students fill out supplements.  completing northwestern's supplement is worthy of course credit. it asks for an essay of up to 500 words, a personal statement of up to 300 words and two shorter statements. then there are the ''optional'' questions. the university of pennsylvania requires an essay beyond the common app's and invites a third should you need to make a further point about ''your intellectual abilities, your sense of imagination and your creativity.''  are these truly optional? ''on occasion, they can get you in,'' says bruce breimer, principal and director of college relations at the collegiate school in manhattan. ''kids grumble, but they do them.''  victoria goldman  supersize supplements  california institute of technology  pages: 4  sample question: ''please fill the rectangle below with something you think is interesting.''  northwestern  pages: 5  sample question: ''if you could pose for a formal oil portrait in the style of hans holbein's 'the ambassadors,' what possessions would surround you and why?''  university of pennsylvania  pages: 4  sample question: ''you have just completed your 300-page autobiography. please submit page 217.''  princeton  pages: 7  sample question: ''your favorite word.''  blackboard

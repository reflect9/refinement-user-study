the boxer-rice exchange   to the editor:  re ''passing exchange becomes political flashpoint focused on feminism'' (news article, jan. 13):  the silliness resulting from senator barbara boxer's comment to secretary of state condoleezza rice -- ''who pays the price?'' -- is nothing more than that: silliness.  neither of these women has family members who are in the military waiting to be sent to iraq or who are already there. that is a fact. it is the truth. it is not demeaning. it is not an attack. it is not antifeminist.  this is wasted rhetoric and an absurdly ridiculous debate.  mary ramniceanu  new york, jan. 14, 2007  to the editor:  senator barbara boxer stepped over a line, but --  shouldn't there be a smidgen of awareness from someone in this administration that there is a singular lack of shared sacrifice in this war?  and that the near total absence from combat of any relatives of the decision makers in this administration symbolizes that difference between this and past wars?  the administration would have done better if it had acknowledged that fact and not merely descended to the obvious reference to feminism.  bruce a. mcallister  palm beach, fla., jan. 13, 2007

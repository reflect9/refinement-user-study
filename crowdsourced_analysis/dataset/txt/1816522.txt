subway rescuer receives the city's highest award   not the weighty medal from mayor michael r. bloomberg, the all-expense-paid trip to disney world, the year's worth of free subway rides, the $10,000 waiting for him from donald trump -- not even the popping flashbulbs and the barrage of questions from a throng of reporters at city hall yesterday could sway wesley autrey, now known as the subway hero, from his central message: if you see something, do something.  ''good things happen when you do good,'' mr. autrey said after the mayor gave him the bronze medallion, the city's highest award for exceptional citizenship and outstanding achievement. the award, for jumping onto the tracks at the 137th street station of the no. 1 line on tuesday to help cameron hollopeter, 20, a film student who had fallen off the platform after having a seizure, puts mr. autrey in the company of gen. douglas macarthur, the rev. dr. martin luther king jr., muhammad ali and willie mays.  ''i'm not looking at this like i'm the hero,'' said mr. autrey, 50, who stood with his daughters, shuqui, 6, and syshe, 4. ''the real heroes are the young women and men that are fighting in iraq now. what i did was something that any and every new yorker should do, you know what i'm saying? you see somebody in distress, do the right thing. you know? help out.''  appearing relaxed throughout the city hall presentation and allowing himself only a ''wow, o.k.,'' then giving a few thumbs-ups for the disney trip and tickets to ''the lion king,'' mr. autrey said that the attention had been overwhelming, adding that he had not expected any of the gifts.  before heading off to meet mr. trump and make a few more appearances for the news media, he hammered home his point, saying that of dozens of people on the platform, only he and two women went to mr. hollopeter's aid.  ''we got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms,'' he said. ''we got to show each other some love.''

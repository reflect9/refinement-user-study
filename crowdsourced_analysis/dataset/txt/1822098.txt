stocks decline as hopes for a rate cut fade   the stock market retreated last week as investors calculated that interest rates won't be dropping when federal reserve policy makers meet on wednesday.  several government reports suggested that the economy remains robust -- perhaps too much so to justify a cut in the fed funds rate, the fed's benchmark short-term rate, which has remained at 5.25 percent since june. on friday, for example, the commerce department said that new-home sales in december jumped to an annual rate of 1.12 million units, and durable-goods orders in december rose 3.1 percent. both were more than wall street had expected.  shares of general motors gained 4.4 percent for the week, the most among the dow industrials. the company said it would report a profit for the fourth quarter, although its 2006 financial results would be delayed.  for the week, the dow jones industrial average fell 78.51 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 12,487.02. the standard & poor's 500-stock index lost 8.32 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,422.18. the nasdaq composite index lost 15.82 points, or about 0.7 percent, to close at 2,435.49.  the yield on the benchmark 10-year treasury bond climbed to 4.87 percent from 4.78 percent the previous week.  jeff sommer  databank

ellsworth kelly   matthew marks gallery  522 and 526 west 22nd street; 523 west 24th street, chelsea  all through jan. 27  there is a great candor to ellsworth kelly's art, and always has been, as you can see in what amounts to a small survey of early and recent work at matthew marks's various chelsea galleries. the largest, on west 22nd street, has a half-dozen of the artist's new abstract relief paintings, made of superimposed geometric panels. they're like altarpiece diptychs with subtly mismatched halves that stack rather than fold.  each painting plays, in a straightforward way, with ideas that the artist, now 83, has been exploring for more than 60 years: the interrelationship, even interchangeability, of painting with sculpture; the creation of fictional objects in real space; the way abstraction can be its own kind of naturalism, intellectually demanding but utterly unesoteric, as plain and packed as a book.  although mr. kelly's work is often associated with bright colors, these new pictures are in black and white. and that in itself has a long history in his career, as is demonstrated in a series of early works on paper in an adjoining gallery. titled ''drawings on a bus -- sketchbook 23, 1954,'' the series was done just after he had moved to new york, where he developed a form of abstraction inspired by the world around him.  the landmark painting ''cit√©'' (1951) is an example. it's like an image of light flickering on dark water, but translated into patterns of black-and-white bars. (the image is recaptured in a singe large print installed in marks's window-only space on west 21st street.)  ''drawings on a bus -- sketchbook 23, 1954'' is what it says it is: a sequence of black ink sketches inspired by a changing shadow cast on a book the artist was reading on a bus ride. the main form starts as a small curve, then gradually swells; if you could look at the drawings flipbook-style, you'd see the black form expand to fill the white page. the sequence, drawn without guile or frills, is a record from nature and a fresh invention, from which the artist derived several black-and-white paintings.  there are more, unstacked double-panel pieces in the west 24th street space. here color returns, not quite bright, not quite subdued, complicated but not all that complicated -- monumental the way a tall open window, a mature rose bush or a shaker dresser is monumental. they aren't.  holland cotter  art in review

the iraq crackup   to the editor:  re ''anti-buildup measure to have bipartisan stamp'' (news article, jan. 17):  president bush said, ''my only call to congress is that if you've got a better way to succeed, step up and explain it.''  this would seem to be somewhat analogous to mr. bush's telling people -- after he's totaled his car by crashing into a tree -- that they are not allowed to criticize his driving unless they first fix his car.  david h. good  new york, jan. 17, 2007

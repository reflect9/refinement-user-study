gas pipeline takes a detour, and opponents applaud   the federal energy regulatory commission has approved a new, scaled-down version of the long-planned millennium natural gas pipeline, to the approval of westchester activists who fought the original plan for years.  the millennium pipeline company, a consortium of several energy companies, initially proposed a pipeline running from the canadian border, across the hudson river at haverstraw bay and into mount vernon, where it would connect to existing pipelines feeding the new york city region.  the commission approved the original route in 2002. but millennium faced sharp opposition from county officials and environmentalists concerned about potential threats to fish and wildlife in haverstraw bay and damage to parks and woodlands in westchester county. a series of regulatory and court decisions effectively killed the original plan last year.  the new route, approved by the commission on dec. 21, would terminate in ramapo in rockland county and connect to an existing, cross-hudson pipeline that passes by the indian point nuclear plant in northern westchester.  the $1.04 billion system, which still requires local, state and federal approvals, would have less capacity than the system approved in 2002. and joseph t. kelliher, chairman of the commission, has warned that the diminished supply could mean higher prices for consumers.  but dani glaser, an organizer with united communities of westchester, which opposed the initial route, said she was pleased that the companies in the consortium were now pursuing a scaled-down alternative.  ''in the end, they were forced to do the right thing,'' she said.  david scharfenberg  the week

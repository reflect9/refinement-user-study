corrections   because of an editing error, an article on thursday about efforts in congress to pass legislation to curb carbon dioxide emissions misstated a comparison of the two measures. a bill introduced by senators john mccain, republican of arizona, and joseph i. lieberman, independent of connecticut, which would tighten controls gradually and include subsidies for nuclear power, is more draconian, not less, than a proposal by senator jeff bingaman, democrat of new mexico. mr. bingaman's bill would put a less stringent cap on emissions and includes a clause that would free industry from the requirements under certain circumstances.

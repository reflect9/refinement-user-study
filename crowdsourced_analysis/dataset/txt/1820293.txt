in service of the music?   to the editor:  re ''jazz is alive and well. in the classroom, anyway.'' by nate chinen [jan. 7]:  one of the positive consequences of -- and perhaps contributing factor toward -- the significant expansion of the jazz education industry in the past 20 years is that it has allowed musicians to maintain a career in jazz, especially as the number of playing gigs fades and the pay for many of those gigs remains the same. as a 50-year-old jazz musician and educator, i have benefited from this expansion, but i do wonder if at some point the jazz education industry will exist more to perpetuate the industry itself than the music.  mark kross  concord, mass.  jazz education

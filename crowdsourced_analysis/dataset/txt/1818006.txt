and today, work begins on first wall   it looks like nothing more than a 22-foot-long, 4-foot-wide hole in the ground. but today, when a 180-foot-tall crane lowers a gigantic steel cage down into the trench, construction will begin on the first section of a $174 million wall more than 1,200 feet long.  resting on bedrock more than 70 feet deep, the concrete wall will keep groundwater from inundating four ground zero office towers, a new transit hub and half a million square feet of retail space.  the wall's unglamorous official name is the east bathtub, and it will encompass the margins of liberty, church and vesey streets, connecting to the concrete bulwark surrounding the world trade center.  filling the trench, at greenwich and liberty streets, ''is a significant first step in beginning the commercial and retail components of the site,'' said anthony r. coscia, chairman of the port authority of new york and new jersey.  glenn collins

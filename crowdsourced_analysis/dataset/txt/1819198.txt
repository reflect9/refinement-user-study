when red tide moves from ocean to air   red tides, the blooms of toxic karenia brevis algae that appear almost every year in florida, often lasting for months and turning the ocean red, may be dangerous to asthma sufferers -- even if they don't go swimming.  the type of algae that flourishes off florida is particularly toxic and is often dispersed into the air. when that happens, anyone near the beach will breathe it in. k. brevis aerosols have been measured as far as a mile inland.  researchers had 97 asthma sufferers, whose average age was 38, take an hourlong walk on a beach in sarasota, fla., during a period of high air and water levels of k. brevis cells and brevetoxins, the poison they produce. before and after their hour at the beach, researchers recorded symptoms and measured each subject's lung function. the report  appears in the january issue of chest.  the more severe their asthma, the more significant were the decreases in lung function and increases in reported symptoms after the one-hour exposure. an hour of beach exposure during a period when there was no red tide caused no difference in symptoms or respiratory function.  what if an asthma sufferer wants to go to the beach? ''stay vigilant about taking your medicine,'' said barbara kirkpatrick, a co-author of the study and a program manager at the mote marine laboratory in sarasota. ''if you do get out to the beach and you're coughing and it's a high-toxin day, that's a day to choose another activity.''  the researchers acknowledge that the study site has common k. brevis contamination, and therefore participants may have had exposure beyond those measured. studies with more subjects will still be required, they say.  vital signs: hazards

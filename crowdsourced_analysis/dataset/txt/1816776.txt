world briefing | americas: canada: liberal lawmaker defects   prime minister stephen harper lured a liberal member of parliament to his conservative caucus, improving odds that his minority government will survive attempts by opposition parties to force an election. the lawmaker, wajid khan of toronto, a former pilot in the pakistani air force, said he had defected partly because he had to choose between staying a liberal and continuing as a special adviser to mr. harper on south asia and the middle east. the conservatives control 125 seats in the 308-seat house of commons, and can now win votes with the support of any one of three opposition parties.  christopher mason

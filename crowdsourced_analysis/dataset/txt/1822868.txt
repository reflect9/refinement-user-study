deal on tv rights   espn and the tennis channel agreed yesterday to share the rights to televise the french and australian opens, an arrangement that will bring a far higher profile to the tennis channel, which has 10 million subscribers.  under the arrangement, espn2 will continue to show 120 hours of australian open coverage, but the tennis channel will augment it with about 100 more. for the french open, whose rights the tennis channel acquired last august, it will carry 100 hours and espn2 will show 55.  ken solomon, the chairman of the tennis channel, said talks that started with espn about sublicensing french open rights soon evolved into a broader deal. ''if it made sense for one, it made sense for more,'' he said.  he added: ''this is a game-changer for us. having a second grand slam is of immeasurable value when we look for distribution. it builds our brand and it brings in a new audience.''  the channel is available on some cable systems and the dish network. it recently announced a separate deal in which it sold a stake in itself to the united states tennis association.  richard sandomir  sports briefing: tennis

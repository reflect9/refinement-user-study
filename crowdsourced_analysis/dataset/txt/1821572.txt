world briefing | asia: north korea: u.n. stops projects and cash   the united nations development program agreed to cease $1.7 million in new projects in north korea until completion of what alejandro d. wolff, the acting united states ambassador, called a ''real, full, thorough, independent, investigative audit'' and to end direct payments in hard currency to local staff members and vendors and recruitment through the north korean government. the $2.7 million in programs that will go forward are those that directly benefit the people of north korea, officials said. the action followed complaints from the united states and japan that some money could be diverted to the government, a claim that north korea dismissed as ''ridiculous and nonsense.''  warren hoge

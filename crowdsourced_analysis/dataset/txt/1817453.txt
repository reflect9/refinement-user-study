metro briefing | new york: manhattan: debate over security funds   senator charles e. schumer, democrat of new york, called on the department of homeland security yesterday to abandon the use of peer review in deciding how to distribute money for high-risk urban areas, and to base financing decisions entirely on risk. on friday, the secretary of homeland security, michael chertoff, said that the six highest-risk urban areas -- including the new york metropolitan area -- would receive 55 percent of the $746.9 million in urban area grants this fiscal year, while 39 other urban regions would get 45 percent. mr. schumer, at a news conference, maintained that given the higher risk of a terrorist attack, the new york area ''would need at least 50 percent'' of the 55 percent -- a share that he conceded new york was unlikely to obtain.  sewell chan

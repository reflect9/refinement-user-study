to say 'bon appétit,' oui or non   your wineglass is filled, and you are about to cut into the confit de canard. whatever you do, don't say, ''bon appétit'' to your french hosts.  ''in france, 'bon appétit' is not proper,'' said marie de tilly, right, who teaches etiquette here. ''when people use it, it sounds just like an invitation for a good digestion and suggests that you are so hungry that you may jump on any food that would cross your mouth.''  the rule is rooted in 19th-century beliefs that anything suggesting the body or bodily functions is improper conversation for the dinner table. it was part of a host of other meal-time rules driven home in an explosion of essays about ''savoir-vivre à la française'' in the 19th century.  ''guests would never touch food with their hands and would only shell shrimps with a knife and a fork,'' said frédéric rouvillois, the author of a book on the history of politeness in france. the hostess ''was never congratulated for the dinner she held.'' talking about food was a taboo. ''it was considered materialistic,'' mr. rouvillois said.  the age, he said, was one ''when people tended to be more interested in intellectual, even idealistic issues.'' he added, ''we kept the ban of bon appétit from that time.''  but not all of the french are aware of the rule against bon appétit.  ''i've never heard anyone telling me bon appétit was not polite,'' said mia hansen, 25, a film director, as she ate at an old restaurant in the bastille section. ''everybody says it all the time.''  maia de la baume

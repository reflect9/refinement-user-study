courageous decision at life's end   to the editor:  i had to laugh when i read paula span's comments on her father's cheapness (''care in old age: confronting the inevitable,'' generations, jan. 21).  it wasn't the only similarity i saw in my own father, who once spent way too much time arguing with the post office because it refused to let him use scotch tape on a stamp that had lost its stickiness. he just couldn't stand the idea that he had to throw the stamp away.  my dad always kept us up to date on where all the important papers were. before he died, he gave us all a great gift: he made his own decision to forgo a feeding tube. he stated simply that he had had a good long life, and that it was time to go.  as ms. span so eloquently put it, it was a final act of parenthood. i admired him so much for having the strength and courage to make the decision. because he spared us from having to make difficult, final choices, i was able to finally forgive him for so many other parental injustices.  barbara kagan  clinton, conn.

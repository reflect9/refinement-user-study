quick bite | new canaan; where the muffins are a must   charisma is as difficult to define in a restaurant as it is in a person. while i sat at a tiny marble-topped table at connecticut muffin in new canaan, nibbling my orange-cranberry muffin and sipping my earl grey tea, a steady stream of people stood in line at the counter for their takeout tea or coffee and assorted danish, muffins and scones. every table (four tiny ones, one large round one seating up to five) was taken, as were the brightly painted stools facing the counter.  the patrons included local real estate agents, builders, members of the town's planning and zoning commission, retired schoolteachers, well-dressed commuters with briefcases, a local author, mothers with toddlers and women snacking after an exercise class at the local y.m.c.a. -- and those were just the people i recognized.  like many towns, new canaan has a surfeit of places to snag a cup of coffee and rev up for the day ahead, and yet this plain, undistinguished place, with tables jammed together, has a steady flow of business all morning long.  the huge muffins (as many as 20 types daily), scones (at least half a dozen), croissants and danish are brought fresh each morning from the owners' bakery on long island.  banana-nut, bran, pumpkin, five-grain, lemon-blueberry and cherry-walnut are just a few of the muffin varieties; there are also five or six types of yogurt and an equal number of low-fat muffins.  the three counter workers serve the patrons with efficiency, good grace and minimal conversation.  connecticut muffin also offers four kinds of soup at lunch, along with grilled paninis and cold sandwiches.  but it is the muffins and scones, and perhaps the cramped intimacy, that makes this unassuming place such a popular hangout.  connecticut muffin, 108 main street, new canaan; (203)-972-7557. open 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. monday through saturday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. sunday.  patricia brooks  connecticut

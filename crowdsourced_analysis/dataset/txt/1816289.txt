sprint nextel reviews its creative account   sprint nextel, one of the nation's largest marketers, said yesterday that it had placed the creative part of its account in review. sprint nextel spends an estimated $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion each year on advertising.  since sprint acquired nextel in 2005, the merged company has been using the former nextel agency, tbwa/chiat/day in new york, for consumer ads and the former sprint agency, publicis & hal riney in san francisco, for business-to-business ads. both agencies are ''world class,'' said a sprint nextel spokeswoman, mary nell westbrook, ''but it's a tough space we operate in, with a lot of competition, and we're looking for fresh approaches and new thinking.''  ms. westbrook said that sprint nextel had not decided whether to ask the incumbents to take part in the review, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of march. the goal is to use a single creative agency, she added, just as last march the company consolidated its media account, once divided between mindshare and starcom, at mindshare.  tbwa/chiat/day is part of the tbwa worldwide division of the omnicom group. riney is part of the publicis groupe, as is starcom; mindshare is part of the wpp group.  addenda

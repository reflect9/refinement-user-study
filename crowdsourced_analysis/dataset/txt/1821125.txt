world briefing | asia: china: one-child policy spurred gender gap   china's top population official said that a worsening gender imbalance had been complicated by population control efforts and that it would take 15 years to redress. the official, zhang weiqing, head of the national population and family planning commission, said 118 boys were born for every 100 girls in china in 2005, largely because of a preference for male offspring, which has driven many families to abort female fetuses under the one-child policy.  howard w. french

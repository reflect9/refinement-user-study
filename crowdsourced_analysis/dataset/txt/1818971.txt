an investment in legal services   to the editor:  legal services of the hudson valley is grateful for your strong editorial supporting inclusion of adequate funding for statewide civil legal services in gov. eliot spitzer's budget (''justice for the poor,'' jan. 7). we are indeed fortunate in westchester county to have the support of the county executive, andrew j. spano, and the westchester county board of legislators (particularly its chairman, william j. ryan), who have made funding for legal services for the poor a priority.  this commitment is shown by the board's addition of significant funding in 2006 for a legal services of the hudson valley office to be opened in march in mount vernon. this office will help poor individuals and families with civil legal problems affecting their most basic needs, such as food, shelter, jobs and access to health care.  by investing in civil legal services, mr. spitzer has a clear opportunity to stabilize cities and save taxpayer dollars by addressing individual legal problems before they become societal problems.  barbara finkelstein  exec. dir., legal services  of the hudson valley  white plains

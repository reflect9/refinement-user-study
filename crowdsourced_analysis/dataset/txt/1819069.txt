thomas says progress will take time   with the knicks unable to put together a consistent stretch of solid play this season, coach isiah thomas said sunday that steadier days would come over time.  he said that the knicks' inconsistency was a result of their youth. after easy victories against portland, seattle and philadelphia, the knicks were routed friday by the charlotte bobcats, one of the league's worst teams.  ''it takes awhile before you figure it out in this league,'' he said.  when asked about a specific time frame, thomas said: ''you really become one of those teams that's played together three or four years, or two or three years. then it kind of all makes sense to you.''  thomas may not have that kind of time. when thomas, also the team president, was named the knicks' coach in june, james l. dolan, the madison square garden chairman, gave him one year to show ''significant progress'' with the team he assembled.

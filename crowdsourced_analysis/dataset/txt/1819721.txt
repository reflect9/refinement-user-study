arts, briefly; new lows for cd sales   music sales continued to slide last week, with another dubious victory for the soundtrack to ''dreamgirls'' (sony): it is on the top of the billboard chart for the second time in a row, but it beat its own record for the lowest sales for a no. 1 album since soundscan began tracking music purchases 16 years ago. in the week that ended sunday, the soundtrack to ''dreamgirls,'' which recently won a golden globe for best musical or comedy film, moved 60,000 copies, 6,000 fewer than it did the week before. akon's ''konvicted'' (universal) remains at no. 2 with 55,000 sales; justin timberlake's ''futuresex/lovesounds'' (jive) climbed one spot to no. 3 with 51,000; and the ''american idol'' alumnus chris daughtry is no. 4 with 50,000 sales of ''daughtry'' (rca). only two new albums are among the top 100 sellers this week: the soundtrack to the disney channel movie ''jump in!'' (disney), at no. 5, and the cellist yo-yo ma's ''appassionato'' (sony classical), which reached no. 79, mr. ma's highest-ever position on the billboard 200 chart.  ben sisario

the week ahead: jan. 14 - 20; classical music   alarm will sound, a supremely inventive new-music ensemble led by alan pierson, is joining forces with musicians from the manhattan school of music for an expansive exploration of edgard varèse's music at the miller theater. varèse stood apart from the early-20th-century battles over tonality. like schoenberg and his followers he abandoned tonality as the cornerstone of musical structure; but unlike his serialist contemporaries, he did not propose a new dogma to replace the old one. instead he painted his works in what he called ''organized sound'' and created a catalog rich in both abstract works, in which timbre and rhythm are central, and soundscapes that evoke the modern urban world. at miller, alarm and company offer a program that ranges from the early ''grand sommeil noir'' (1906) through an orchestrated version of the ''poème Électronique'' (1957-58). saturday at 8 p.m., broadway at 116th street, morningside heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25, $15 for students.  yo-yo ma's silk road ensemble has for the last several years explored ancient and new music from countries along the old trade route that connected asia and europe. now, in a spinoff from that project, members of the ensemble are continuing their explorations on their own. siamak jahangiri, who plays the ney (a middle eastern flute), and the string quartet brooklyn rider offer a program that includes bartok's quartet no. 2, a selection of armenian folk songs and ''ney-nava'' by the iranian composer hossein alizadeh. tuesday at 7 p.m., makor, 35 west 67th street, manhattan, (212) 601-1000, 92y.org; $15.  if you're looking for something more conventional, the violinist vadim repin joins forces with the new york philharmonic for the tchaikovsky violin concerto. and you get something a bit off the beaten path: riccardo muti fills out the program with scriabin's rich-hued symphony no. 3, ''the divine poem.'' thursday at 7:30 p.m., friday at 2 p.m. and saturday at 8 p.m., avery fisher hall, lincoln center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96.  and daniel barenboim, in town a few weeks ago to conduct his west-eastern divan orchestra, is back to offer his idiosyncratic but compelling reading of bach's ''well-tempered clavier,'' book 1. saturday at 8 p.m., carnegie hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108.

living here | houses near ice boating; fun when it freezes   this cabin is less than 10 minutes from our house in madison and it's only about 700 square feet. but it's right on the lake, and it has a detached garage. that was the real attraction for me, because up until then, i'd been trying to build a renegade ice yacht in my basement. this required punching a hole in the wall, something that wasn't very pleasing to my wife. this garage, on the other had, is already in borderline tear-down condition, so, you know, knocking out holes isn't that big a deal.  i must have been 11 or 12 years old the first time i saw an ice boat. it was one of those years with beautiful black ice on the lake. i was skating with a group of friends, and this guy sailed by and offered to tow us across the lake. i knew i had to have one.  so, right after college, i started building and sailing. from the beginning, i had great help from the guys at the four lakes ice yacht club. it's been around for about 80 years, and the older guys have been real mentors to me. nothing gets me out of bed like checking on the work i did on a boat the day before. i just grab a cup of coffee and go straight to the garage to take a look.  ice boating is similar to sailing, but unlike regular sailing, the friction is minimal, you can sail upward of five times the speed of wind. therein lies the thrill. sitting low, so close to the ice, it feels like you're going 100 miles an hour. for years, i was able to lie about things like that, but now with global positioning systems, i know it's more like 60.  as told to bethany lyttle  information on properties was supplied by the owners or the listing companies.  where -- houghton lake, mich.  what -- 3-bedroom house  how much -- $369,000  this 1,652-square-foot ranch-style house is on houghton lake, a popular destination for ice sailing and other winter sports. the house has large windows with full lake views. the property has 50 feet of lakefront, a seawall and a sandy bottom beach. there are two bathrooms, a large family room with lake views, a sun room, a remodeled kitchen, a stone fireplace and a one-car garage. lake houghton is 120 miles north of lansing. broker: sheila sensor, century 21 professional realty, 800-536-1103. www.century21-professionalrealty.com.  where -- tonka bay, minn.  what -- 3-bedroom house  how much -- $1.25 million  on lafayette bay on lake minnetonka, this 1,800-square-foot house overlooks a protected harbor with a dock large enough for a 35-foot boat. it has 68 feet of water frontage and a lakefront terrace. built in 1958, the house has two bathrooms, beamed ceilings and a stone corner fireplace flanked by large windows with lake views. agent: mark grieger, edina realty, (952) 476-5360;

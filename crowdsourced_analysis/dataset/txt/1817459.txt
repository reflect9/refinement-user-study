chevy will be ready when the batteries are   introduced on sunday: chevrolet volt design study  is it real? not now. not next year. but general motors will be ready when the batteries are.  what's the point? plug-in hybrids have been the buzz among environmentalists, so g.m. set its engineers to building the best possible example -- a theoretical 150-mile-a-gallon car, complete with an onboard generating station.  what they said: ''here it is, a fully electric-drive car from g.m. i am shocked -- i am truly shocked,'' said robert a. lutz, vice chairman of general motors. ''it proves that environmentally conscious cars can actually look good.''  what they didn't say: this vehicle must wait for the battery of the future, not today's cumbersome and somewhat fragile energy storage systems.  what makes it tick? a small three-cylinder gas engine drives only a 53-kilowatt generator -- it is not connected to the wheels at all. the charge is stored in a long lithium-ion battery pack that runs down the middle of the car. a 160-horsepower electric motor moves the front-wheel-drive volt, giving 0-60 acceleration of 8.5 seconds and a theoretical range of 640 miles. the car can also be plugged in to a standard wall outlet for a 6.5 hour recharge.  how much, how soon? no production estimates, no prices given. g.m. says the battery technology is expected to be available around 2010.  how's it look? sleek and coupe-like, the volt shows some of the design edge that characterizes cadillac, with the sport sensibility of the saturn sky. the chevrolet bow-tie logo was particularly prominent; one g.m. executive said informally that the chevy badge was meant to show the volt was a global concept.

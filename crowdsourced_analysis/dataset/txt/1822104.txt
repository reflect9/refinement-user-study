the star system in soccer   to the editor:  re ''star-struck on the soccer field, and in the boardroom'' (economic view, jan. 21):  while i applaud major league soccer for getting a star like david beckham, i question what this will do for the sport. when stars like michael jordan and wayne gretzky captured our imaginations, their respective sports already had big, solid bases of fans, something that despite considerable effort by many, soccer has yet to attract in america. the foundation is needed before rewards can be reaped by the beckham signing.  steven m. clayton  ocean, n.j., jan. 21

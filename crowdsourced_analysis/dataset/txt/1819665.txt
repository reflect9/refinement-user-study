take an internet call and some notes, or just doodle   you can't put the world in your pocket, but you can put the web there, with nokia's n800 internet tablet, which is about the size of a paperback (3 by 6 by  1/2 inch). like the earlier n770, it lets you browse the internet, send and receive e-mail and instant messages, download audio and video and get r.s.s. feeds. the n800 adds a web cam for videoconferencing and a microphone for internet phone calls.  as a media player, the n800 handles mp3 and windows media files and other common audio and video formats, displaying images on a 4.1-inch color screen and playing audio through built-in stereo speakers or a headphone. content can be loaded from sd or mmc memory cards, streamed from the web or downloaded through a u.s.b. connection from another computer. the tablet uses wi-fi networking, but it can also connect to a compatible nokia phone via bluetooth and use it as a wireless modem.  the tablet, available from retailers and www.nokiausa.com for $400, has an on-screen keyboard. it will recognize text written with a stylus, which can also be used for doodling.  ivan berger  circuits

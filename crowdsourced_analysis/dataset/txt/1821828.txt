corrections   a map last saturday showing parishes affected by the reorganization plans of the roman catholic archdiocese of new york misidentified a bronx parish scheduled for closing. it is st. anthony's at 4505 richardson avenue, in the northern part of the borough -- not st. anthony's at 1496 commonwealth avenue, in the central bronx. a corrected version of the map can be found at www.nytimes.com/2007/01/20/nyregion/20churches.html.

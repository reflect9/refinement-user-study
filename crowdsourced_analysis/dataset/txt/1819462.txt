defining our values   to the editor:  in ''the american way of equality'' (column, jan. 14), david brooks says: ''when americans use the word 'equality,' they really mean 'fair opportunity.' when americans use the word 'freedom,' they really mean 'opportunity.' ''  that's what one conservative columnist may think we believe. but when this american uses the word ''equality,'' i mean ''equal opportunity.'' when i use the word ''freedom,'' i'm referring to the rights guaranteed to americans by our constitution, including the bill of rights.  freedom is precious. no american should be confused about it.  iris kaufman  swampscott, mass., jan. 14, 2007

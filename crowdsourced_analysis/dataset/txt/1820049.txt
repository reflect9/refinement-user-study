the quicksand of debt   to the editor:  re ''banks gone wild,'' by joe lee and thomas parrish (op-ed, jan. 13):  a dictionary definition of usury is: ''the illegal action or practice of lending money at unreasonably high rates of interest.''  is 29.99 percent -- the rate paid by ''t. p.,'' a credit-card holder mentioned by mr. lee and mr. parrish -- usurious?  it's a simple question. a congressional committee could call in the heads of the banks and credit-card companies who charge such rates and ask them to respond to this and other simple questions, for example:  at what point does an interest rate become usurious? forty percent? fifty percent?  according to a personal-finance columnist cited in the article, ''if t. p. continued to pay little more than the monthly minimum, it could take him more than 30 years to pay off his balance -- even if he never went shopping again.''  is t. p. a customer or an indentured servant?  morton mintz  washington, jan. 13, 2007

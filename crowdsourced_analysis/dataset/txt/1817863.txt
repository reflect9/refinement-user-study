corrections   an article in business day on saturday about the energy efficient ways of the japanese misstated the amount of energy consumed in japan and the united states as measured in tons of oil per person. japan consumed the energy equivalent of 2.8 tons of oil per person in 2004, not 2.8 million tons. likewise, the united states consumed 5.4 tons of oil per person, not 5.4 million tons. the article also referred imprecisely to the output from a home fuel cell used by a japanese homeowner, kiminobu kimura. the cell produces one kilowatt of power per hour; not one kilowatt per hour.

2 plan a production company   gail berman and lloyd braun, two hollywood executives who formerly ran network entertainment divisions, have created a company to produce entertainment for television, films and the internet.  no details of the partnership have yet been announced, but an entertainment industry executive close to both said yesterday that they had been meeting with potential partners in hollywood and seeking office space.  the new company, which is expected to be called berman-braun productions, will bring together two former competitors who are longtime personal friends. ms. berman ran the entertainment division of the fox network from july 2000 to march 2005. mr. braun led the entertainment division at abc from july 1999 to april 2004.  both have been closely linked with hit programs in the recent past. ms. berman was instrumental in getting shows like ''24'' and ''house'' on fox, and mr. braun was the executive who initiated and championed ''lost'' at abc.  about two months ago, mr. braun resigned as head of the media division at yahoo after an effort to develop original entertainment programming for the web site proved a disappointment.  ms. berman left her post as president of paramount pictures more than two weeks ago after enduring what several studio executives described as a rocky relationship with the chairman, brad grey.  both mr. braun and ms. berman declined comment yesterday.  the new company is expected to seek financing from as many as three partners, according to the industry executive, who declined to be named because its creation had not been formally announced.

eau de new york city   new yorkers have spent the last few days getting sneering phone calls and e-mail from friends in distant places. some recommended their favorite air fresheners or asked if we washed our socks. others worried that this week's big stink was a plot of some kind -- perhaps terrorists, of course, since we always think that first now. but perhaps it was the work of somebody launching a fancy new oxygen atomizer: fresh air from the islands at only $5 a whiff.  what happened on monday morning at 9 was that large swaths of manhattan started to smell extremely bad. described by most as the smell your gas stove makes when you forget to light the burner, the odor lasted about an hour. it was so bad in some areas that people decided not to go outside and smoke for fear of igniting the neighborhood.  as expected, new jersey was quickly blamed for the foul smell. but to date, there has been no public explanation for what the stink was or where it came from. similarly, there has been no public explanation of a very sweet smell that took over most of manhattan in late 2005 and was described as being a very good imitation of imitation maple syrup.  the lack of answers about these smells did nothing to deter the theories. one favorite: are the security folks testing to see what a really dangerous gas would do if released over the big city? did somebody then map the complaint pattern to see who would go first? or: was this an industrial leak that nobody is acknowledging for fear of lawsuits? or: has air quality improved so much in new york that we can actually notice an odd smell?  it is a frightening world, and new yorkers now know to speak up if we see, hear, sense -- or smell -- something untoward. this time the problem blew over quickly, except on the late-night comedy circuit. it was, thankfully, just a big-city stink, not an urban disaster.  editorial

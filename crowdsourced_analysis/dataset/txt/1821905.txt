a vote for a hotel chain   to the editor: ''budget hotels in europe: a little style, a little room and a little price'' by michelle higgins prompted me to inform your readers about apsis hotels, a small spanish chain. there are seven hotels in barcelona, one in madrid, two in girona, two in andorra and one in luchon, france.  my wife and i recently stayed at the gran ducat, a centrally located hotel off the plaza catalunya and la rambla. our four-night stay was about $450. the rooms were very small, but had private facilities. we were upgraded to a comfort room which was in the rear of the hotel and less noisy.  the hotel was a real bargain at a little over $100 a night. barcelona can be expensive as the dollar continues to fall against the euro.  elliot j. moritz  chestnut ridge, n.y.

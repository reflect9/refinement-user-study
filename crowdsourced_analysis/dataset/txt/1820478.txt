the orange meets economics 101   at one bodega in brooklyn on friday, a big, thick-skinned navel orange cost 99 cents. in other parts of the country, that price might seem steep. but within a couple of weeks, it could be a bargain. the culprit: a citrus-killing freeze that hit california, which supplies 95 percent of the nation's navel oranges in the winter.  how high can navel orange prices go? it's a simple matter of supply and demand.  the navel orange is one of the few remaining staples in the produce bins that remains untouched by globalization -- at least in the winter.  in the summer, when the american crop isn't in season, the nation eats navels from australia and south america. but it's not yet navel season in the southern hemisphere. and don't expect the american south to come to the rescue. the navel crops in louisiana and texas are too small, and most of the oranges grown in florida are turned into juice.  so that leaves only the portion of the california crop that survived temperatures in the 20s and lower last week.  about 30 percent of the winter fruit was picked before the freeze, enough to keep the united states eating navels for almost two weeks. once the threat of frost is over and citrus ranchers can take a good look at the trees, they might find enough fruit to keep shipping at least a small supply out of state through february. but with an estimated $610 million in navel oranges lost to ice, the price will jump.  already, prices have almost doubled, said bill taubenfeld of b. t. produce, one of the largest wholesalers in the northeast. a case of small navels that he sold for $13 earlier in the month is now $24. he and other produce wholesalers say prices might triple on oranges that have already been picked.  all of which might make a $3 navel orange a very real possibility, at least in brooklyn.  kim severson  the basics

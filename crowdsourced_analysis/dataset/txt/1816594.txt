corrections   an article on sunday about some of the more captivating events in the new york region in 2006 referred incorrectly to a federal investigation of jared paul stern, a former contributor to the page six section of the new york post whom ronald w. burkle, the supermarket magnate, has accused of an extortion attempt. the investigation came to light when it was reported by the post; it was not announced by federal authorities. in addition, allegations that mr. stern had been caught on video demanding a $100,000 payment, as well as monthly stipends, for keeping negative accounts of mr. burkle from the press were made by mr. burkle, not by federal authorities.

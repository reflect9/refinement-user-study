arts, briefly; pompidou center confirms plans for a shanghai outpost   bruno racine, president of the georges pompidou center in paris, says he expects a museum carrying the pompidou's name to open in shanghai ''before 2010.'' in an interview with le monde, mr. racine said that the new pompidou would be a chinese museum but that its programming would be determined by the pompidou center. ''this project will not cost the pompidou center one cent,'' he said, adding that its purpose would be to introduce western art to the chinese public and to build up a collection of contemporary chinese art. pointing to what he called the challenge of globalization, mr. racine defended plans to rent the name and expertise of the louvre to a new museum in abu dhabi, a move that has been sharply criticized in some french art circles. asked about the pompidou's plans post-shanghai, he said, ''we must not run ahead of ourselves, but we should think about india.''  alan riding

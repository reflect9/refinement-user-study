national briefing | midwest: illinois: lawsuit against governor's administration   a government watchdog group filed a lawsuit in state court against the administration of gov. rod r. blagojevich, seeking to obtain copies of subpoenas issued to his office in a continuing federal investigation into hiring practices. the watchdog, the better government association, asserted that the subpoenas, which it tried unsuccessfully to obtain last summer under the illinois freedom of information act, were a matter of public record. but a spokeswoman for the governor's office, abby ottenhoff, said the administration had received clear instructions from prosecutors not to discuss or disclose any information related to subpoenas. though mr. blagojevich, a democrat, has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation, his administration has been dogged by accusations of hiring fraud and a kickback scheme in a state pension program.  libby sander

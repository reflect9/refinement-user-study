corrections   a news analysis article on sunday about senator hillary rodham clinton's presidential prospects misstated the results of a recent washington post/abc news poll and erroneously attributed the incorrect number to a statement by her campaign. mrs. clinton led senator barack obama in the preference poll of likely democratic primary voters by 41 percent to 17 percent; she did not hold a 41 percentage point lead over mr. obama. the campaign's statement correctly reflected the polling data; it did not contain the incorrect percentage.

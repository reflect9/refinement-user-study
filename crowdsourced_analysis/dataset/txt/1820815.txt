making a case for early testing for skin cancer   if doctors began a broad screening program for early signs of melanoma, they might find any number of cases soon enough to save lives. but would it be worth the cost?  a new study argues that it would, making comparisons to the screenings for breast and colorectal cancer that are now an accepted part of medicine.  writing in the current archives of dermatology, researchers said the most cost-effective way of screening for melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, would be to have everyone checked once after age 50. they said it might also be beneficial to have screenings every two years for people whose brother or sister have had the disease.  ''melanoma is the only cancer for which incidence and mortality rates are rising unabated,'' the study said, ''while screening, the potential means for reducing the burden of disease, continues to be underused.''  unlike the case with some other cancers, there have been no large-scale studies proving that more melanoma screening is worthwhile economically.  in the absence of those studies, the researchers, led by elena losina of the boston university school of public health, built a mathematical model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a variety of screening approaches.  with an estimated 60,000 new cases of invasive melanoma diagnosed each year, the study said, the cost of the disease is more than $740 million annually in the united states.  using their model, the researchers tried to estimate how many dollars would be spent for each extra year of life brought about by screening. they found that compared with other cancer screening programs, melanoma screening is ''very cost-effective.''  vital signs: screening

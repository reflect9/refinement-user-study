world briefing | americas: venezuela: u.s. envoy says bags are packed   diplomatic relations with the united states appeared to become more fragile as william brownfield, the american ambassador, responded to a threat of expulsion from president hugo chávez by saying, ''my bags are always packed and ready.'' mr. brownfield, in a visit to maracaibo, also emphasized that he hoped to avoid further confrontation and to focus instead on issues of political and economic importance to both caracas and washington. mr. chávez, who has threatened to expel mr. brownfield before, said on thursday night that he could declare the ambassador ''persona non grata'' if he continued to comment on such issues as venezuela's plan to nationalize companies controlled by foreign investors.  simon romero

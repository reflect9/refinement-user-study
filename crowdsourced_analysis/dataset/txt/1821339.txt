corrections   an obituary on friday about the humor columnist art buchwald referred incorrectly to his novel-writing. ''a gift from the boys'' (1958) and ''the bollo caper'' (1974) were not his only novels. he also wrote ''irving's delight'' (1975) and ''stella in heaven: almost a novel'' (2000).  the obituary also misspelled the place of residence of one of his surviving children. joel buchwald lives in culpeper, not culpepper, va.

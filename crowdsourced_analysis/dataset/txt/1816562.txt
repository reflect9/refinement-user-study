arts, briefly; tough times continue for recording industry   despite rising digital music sales, the recording industry is still struggling, according to annual data released yesterday by nielsen soundscan. album sales declined almost 5 percent last year, to 588 million, as a doubling in sales of digital albums failed to compensate for a slide in cds. the latest figures follow a 7 percent drop the previous year and come as the industry battles a host of challenges, including piracy, competing forms of entertainment and a paucity of new talent. meanwhile the digital marketplace is not expanding as rapidly as many in the business had hoped. sales of digital singles jumped 65 percent last year, to about 582 million units. more digital singles were sold than cds for the first time. but the rise was not enough to offset the drop in full albums. the best-selling album of the year was the soundtrack to the disney channel movie ''high school musical,'' with sales of more than 3.7 million copies. the best-selling digital song of the year was daniel powter's ''bad day,'' which sold more than 2 million copies.  jeff leeds

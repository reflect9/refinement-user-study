critic's choice: new cds   animal collective  ''people'' (fatcat)  in their own cryptic, low-key way, the members of animal collective have had a triumphant few years. in 2005 they released a glorious album called ''feels''; its flickering experiments and lightheaded love songs (were they love songs?) unfolded without ever quite giving up their secrets. the album eventually sold about 40,000 copies in the united states; that's an impressive number for a band like this. and late last year animal collective signed with domino records, one of the country's leading indie-rock labels.  maybe that's why this little cd sounds so exuberant. ''people,'' the new animal collective mini-album, was available for sale on the band's recent tour, and some stores have been selling an import version; now fatcat is issuing a domestic pressing. the disc, which lasts about 19 minutes, is dominated by two versions of the title track. the studio version, a typically lush and detailed outtake from the ''feels'' sessions, uses a simple bass line and a simpler lyric (''yeah, ye-ah'') to build up momentum; eventually it explodes into a scream: ''people! people!'' and in the live version, you can hear some of those people screaming back.  kelefa sanneh

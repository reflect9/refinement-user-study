preserving landmarks for all new yorkers   to the editor:  as a professional preservationist, i take offense at the implicit charge of racial exclusion in a letter that states, ''emphasizing bricks and mortar can come at the expense of economic and ethnic diversity'' (''battle lines in the fight to protect sunnyside,'' jan. 7).  landmark designation does not have a racial agenda. new york city's administrative code states clearly that ''the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use'' of buildings and ''landscape features of special character or historical or aesthetic interest is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety and welfare of the people.'' the people, not ''some'' people.  forty years of urban experience has shown that landmark designation works to forward this worthwhile municipal goal. landmarking does not cause population exclusion or displacement, and to place it along with redlining, urban renewal and other racially charged planning practices is both incorrect and inappropriate.  simeon bankoff  executive director  historic districts council  east village

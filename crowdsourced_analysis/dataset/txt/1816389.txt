praise from a former rival   a few minutes after gov. eliot spitzer's address, as the crowds left the capitol's assembly chamber, a familiar figure walked slowly down the stairs, buffeted by the crush of bodies with nary a press secretary to smooth his passage. it was thomas r. suozzi, the bright, passionate nassau county executive who ran an uphill -- some would say politically suicidal -- primary campaign against mr. spitzer, and lost.  mr. suozzi, who during the address was seated with some of mr. spitzer's new appointees, said the governor had laid out ''a very ambitious and exciting agenda.''  ''it's going to be very tough, but if there's one person who can accomplish it, it's governor spitzer,'' said mr. suozzi, who last fall attacked mr. spitzer for failing to prosecute medicaid fraud, accused him of throwing ''a temper tantrum'' at one debate, and said that as a prosecutor, mr. spitzer did not ''understand what it takes to manage a large, complex, multibillion-dollar government.''  asked what he thought of mr. spitzer's delivery, he smiled tightly and responded graciously.  ''i would only wish that i could do it as well as he had done it,'' mr. suozzi said.  nicholas confessore  changeover in albany

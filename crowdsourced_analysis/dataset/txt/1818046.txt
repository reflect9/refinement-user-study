protecting our skin   to the editor:  ''the cosmetics restriction diet'' (thursday styles, jan. 4) reminds us that using multiple products may cause the skin to break out.  each cosmetic may contain 30 or 40 chemicals, some of which cause irritation or allergy. the skin is the essential barrier between our internal organs and the outside world. it is the largest organ and is a remarkable protector, but exposure to many substances can be harmful.  we often advise patients to refrain from using anything nonessential to reverse adverse reactions. we should show great respect to our wonderful ''container.''  stephen danziger, m.d.  brooklyn, jan. 4, 2007  the writer is chief of dermatology at new york methodist hospital.

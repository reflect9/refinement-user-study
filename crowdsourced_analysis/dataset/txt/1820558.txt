forget the airport. give us better trains!   to the editor:  in his op-ed article about the hudson valley (''mr. spitzer's valley,'' jan. 7), ned sullivan of scenic hudson discusses possibilities for ''smart'' development there, including ''smart'' transportation in the expansion of stewart airport as the fourth major downstate airport.  if ever there were a worse proposal for the region, it escapes me. the only reason such a proposal is even surfacing is the paucity of decent train service in new york state. mr. sullivan doesn't even acknowledge the need to upgrade the railroads in the area. if we had fast, convenient and reliable train service between new york and chicago and other eastern cities, there would not even be the need to expand stewart.  mr. sullivan also does not mention the need for public transportation in the immediate region. the overwhelmed parking lots at the poughkeepsie train station and others up and down the valley attest to the absence of such a service. until attention is paid to these essential requirements for ''smart development,'' expansion of any aspect of such development will be detrimental to the fundamental health of the region.  carol h. valentine  staatsburg, n.y.

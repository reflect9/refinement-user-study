7 megapixels and a 7x zoom in a rather small package   casio's 7-megapixel ex-v7 packs an inordinate number of features into its diminutive 2.4-by-3.8-by-1-inch body. the 7x zoom lens is long enough to catch action across the soccer field.  at these lengths, zoom lenses let in less light, forcing cameras to use slower shutter speeds, which can result in blurred action. the ex-v7, which will go on sale in early march for $399, addresses this age-old problem by tracking moving objects and boosting both shutter speed and the camera's sensitivity -- the iso speed -- which can reach a high 1600.  to counter the increased graininess of images taken at higher iso speeds, the camera applies noise reduction to areas where it is most noticeable, like skin and sky. an image stabilization circuit further reduces blur from hand motion that can be magnified by the long lens.  also on the ex-v7's laundry list of features is an ebay mode that is designed to help you sell your stuff online. this auto-macro mode shoots ultraclose-ups while remaining in focus for regular-distance shots. images are automatically reduced for web display and placed in a folder marked ''ebay'' for easy uploading and offloading.  marty katz  circuits

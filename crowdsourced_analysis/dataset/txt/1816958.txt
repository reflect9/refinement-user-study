jewish family christmas   every year i read articles about jews who celebrate christmas or wish they celebrated it (lives, jennifer gilmore, dec. 24). just once, i'd like to read about jews like me, who do not, and never wanted to, celebrate christmas. i know that for many it is a lovely holiday. it is not my holiday, and i don't celebrate it any more than i celebrate bastille day or cinco de mayo.  marian s. lubinsky  south deerfield, mass.

living in the wake of an accident   to the editor:  kevin coyne's stirring article ''measuring eternity, and lives'' (jersey column, jan. 14) surely hit a nerve for me, and probably for all parents who recognize what pawns of destiny we are when our children drive or ride in cars.  i was particularly struck by mr. coyne's observation about the ''why here?'' syndrome.  i live in moorestown, a small place not unlike freehold. and we've had our share of ''why here?'' moments with teenage accidents.  the bottom line: why not here? accidents know no geography, and the pain and grief in their wake seems universal.  i've hugged my own daughters close, then driven them through our norman rockwellian streets to local funeral homes for the memorial services of unspeakably young classmates who died in fiery crashes.  and no, one never forgets. not the tears, the disbelief, the shock and the rage. at my recent high school reunion, we were still talking about the classmate who was killed in an accident during our senior year.  i should mention that it was 50 years ago -- and it was yesterday.  sally friedman  moorestown

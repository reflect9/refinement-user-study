no substitute for nutrients   to the editor:  re ''an old cholesterol remedy is new again'' (jan. 23): medicine's faith in pharmaceuticals is another example of how people mistakenly believe they can change fundamental processes in nature. the age-old problem with pharmaceutical treatments is that no drug can replace the function of a nutrient, in this instance niacin (vitamin b3).  drugs work -- if one can call it ''work'' -- by interfering with normal biochemical processes. in contrast, nutrients function by providing the normal biochemical substrates for more complex chemicals and reactions. all roads eventually point back to nutrition: our entire biochemistry, including our genes, depends on nutrients, not drugs.  jack challem  tucson

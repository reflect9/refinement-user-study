flighty beethoven, liberated monteverdi and brotherly bach   monteverdi: 'vespro della beata vergine'  gabrieli consort and players, conducted by paul mccreesh. archiv produktion 00289 477 6147; two cds.  one way to look at musical interpretation is as a conflict between doing what we are told to do and doing what we want. the 18th century is a particularly vivid battlefield, given the flood of advice left behind by tutorial minds like c. p. e. bach, j. j. fux, leopold mozart, jean-philippe rameau and others -- all tugging at the current performer's sleeve with the correct ornament, tempo or dotted rhythm, and hardly unanimous in their opinions.  go back 100 years, and the free spirit has more room to work. why? because we know less. ignorance may not be bliss, but it can liberate the imagination. we agree, for example, that monteverdi's vespers is an important event, a swing piece between the renaissance and the baroque. wonder of wonders, we have a printed score from 1610, although in black-and-white it tells us as much about what we don't know as about what we do.  this in no way stands in the way of lovely recordings like that by paul mccreesh and the gabrieli consort and players. mr. mccreesh has been performing and pondering this music for 25 years and has ended up with perhaps enlightened speculation but no answers. is this a compendium to be cherry-picked or a single work? where do we orchestrate and where not? where do we transpose the sections that read ''unperformable'' to us? and are we reading correctly in the first place?  does it really matter, given the pure vocal and instrumental sound of mr. mccreesh's forces, and monteverdi's stately decorum and sinuous counterpoint, which impress in any configuration? early music becomes more modern the earlier it is. so too monteverdi's vespers, which forces us to say as much about ourselves in the 21st century as about the dawn of the baroque.  bernard holland  classical recordings

snapping turtles do snap   to the editor:  it's good to know that verlyn klinkenborg is among those of us who stop to help tortoises on their way on a busy road (''edges and order,'' the rural life, jan. 1).  i have done that, and afterward felt at least virtuous if not godlike. but not long ago on a lonely road in northern connecticut, i stopped to administer similar compassion, only to be stoutly rebuffed by a vicious snapping turtle that refused to be helped. i confess that i felt a certain animosity toward the reptile, and have yet to decide whether i will help his or her cousins in the future.  robert longley  salisbury, conn., jan. 2, 2007

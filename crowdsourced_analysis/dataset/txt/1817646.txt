world briefing | europe: britain: diana inquest judge wants ordinary jurors   lady butler-sloss, the judge presiding over the inquest into the death of diana, princess of wales, said at a preliminary hearing that she had not yet decided whether to convene a jury to hear the case. but she said that in any case it would be ''inappropriate'' to empanel a jury made up of members of the royal household, as is the usual custom in deaths that involve the royal family. the inquest -- whose purpose is to determine the identity of the deceased and the time, place and manner of death -- has been delayed by, among other things, long investigations by france and britain. in a report released last month, the british police concluded that the car crash that killed diana in paris in 1997 was a result of an accident caused by a drunk driver, and that it was not a murderous conspiracy. lady butler-sloss said she hoped to schedule the full inquest for the beginning of may at the latest.  sarah lyall

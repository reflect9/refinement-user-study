a child's view of play: leave it to us kids!   to the editor:  i am 9 years old, and i read your article ''can johnny come out and (be taught to) play?'' (week in review, jan. 14). you were talking about fantasy, and i do not think any grown-ups can actually lead fantasy play.  we would be over the hill and back down the other side, and then back to where we'd started before they'd even gotten started. neither would they understand anything we were talking about because they haven't read any of the books we've read.  we prefer climbing structures to run up and back and through again. kids don't need to be ''properly guided'' on the playground. then we wouldn't think right. we don't do very many pickup games, but we do a lot of fantasy games. we also do a lot of collaborative games, and one of our favorite games is: be-whatever-you-want-to-be -- where we turn into otters and squirrels fighting shrews and other things with swords and not machine guns.  i agree with the 11-year-old you quoted from 100 years ago: i do care if grown-ups tell me what to do on the playground and in our fantasy games. they might want us to be a squirrel when we want to be an otter!  you can't model an imaginary world, or at least not one of ours!  gabriel lubbock  cambridge, mass., jan. 16, 2007

corrections   a review of new york books on dec. 31, in appraising ''water-works: the architecture and engineering of the new york city water supply,'' referred incorrectly to the origin of the octagonal logo used by jpmorgan chase & company. ivan chermayeff, who designed the logo with tom geismar, said the design was intended to be distinctive and geometric; he said the design was not related to a new york water provider that was the forerunner to jpmorgan chase & company. the logo was not intended to resemble a cross-section of a wooden water pipe, and any such resemblance was not the decisive factor in the selection of the logo from several proposed designs.

a virtual town square reinvents community   to the editor:  as a sociologist i interpreted ''anytown, online'' (jan. 14) as an indication that americans may no longer be ''bowling alone.''  the arrival of community-themed web sites that emphasize local news and information heralds the reinvention of community. by creating a new virtual town square, it enables citizens to access information and news ranging from local traffic reports to community news items in a timely manner while providing a means for citizens to ''socially'' interact and comment on news postings from their home or office computer.  this new modality of communication enables citizens to reconnect with neighbors, friends and family, and creates a new sense of community in tune with the cyber age. to paraphrase marshall mcluhan, the new global village is just a mouse click away.  arnold korotkin  upper montclair

the listings: jan. 26-feb. 1; jacco olivier   yet another painter working in animation might seem a little tiresome. but these wistful filmed animations of loosely brushed seascapes and landscapes by jacco olivier are perfectly lovely. it is no revelation that mr. olivier is from the netherlands -- dutch artists more or less invented landscape imagery in the late 16th century. this artist, of course, updates the genre in the works projected onto the walls of the marianne boesky gallery, like ''community'' (2006), left. he takes us on blissful sensory journeys, usually no more than a minute long, through the little towns and countryside around his home in amsterdam. we watch the tide go out in the north sea, contemplate birds circling high in the sky and follow a butterfly through woods to where a deer lies in wait. but we also see factories, modern buildings, cars and what looks like a rush-hour scene, with people huddling together to cross a road. in the film ''saeftinghe'' (2006), a town is engulfed in a flood, leaving behind a river of floating debris. the imagery is marvelously painterly, the individual frames sometimes bordering on abstraction, though the narrative structure owes much to the techniques of film. mr. olivier's peculiar genius is to have effortlessly combined them.

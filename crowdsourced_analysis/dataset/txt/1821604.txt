art in review; seaworthy -- a nautical selection from minton to mermaids   andrea frank  new photographs  edward thorp  210 11th avenue, at 25th street, chelsea  through tomorrow  the strange promiscuity of edward thorp's eye is one of the art world's better-kept secrets. as interested in decorative art as in the reportedly more serious kind, he regularly assembles shows that surprise, delight and inform. his latest effort is no exception; mixing contemporary and older works in all mediums, it makes a nice scratch in the surface of an immense artistic theme: the sea.  on the fine art side, you'll find ''the gale of sept. 6, 1868,'' a vertiginous wall of green dotted with helpless boats painted in the 1920s by a new england folk artist named jonathan frost; a 1957 painting by one julie henry that forces frederic church, salvador dal√≠ and mark innerst into weird proximity; along with rewardingly uncharacteristic works by arnold friedman, biala, abraham walkowitz, edwin dickinson, marsden hartley and louis eilshemius.  on the decorative/design side there are japanese glass fishing-net floats and a handsome portable lighthouse from around 1925; seashells covered in sterling silver; a beautiful murano art glass nautilus by giulio radi; plates from minton and wedgwood; and two small caches of unusual fishing lures.  somehow this doesn't overwhelm what is on view in a small adjacent room: andrea frank's large, deceptively serene color photographs of immense oceangoing vessels shot at close quarters from small, harbor-friendly ones. the huge volumes of these ships loom against the sky, foreshortened and truncated into unexpected geometries. the persistent effect is of being uncomfortably near a height-challenged hunter closing in on an elephant.  roberta smith

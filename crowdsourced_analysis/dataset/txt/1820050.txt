elderly organ donors   to the editor:  re ''turning the grief-stricken toward organ donation'' (news article, jan. 16): it is important to note that young healthy people who die from accidents are not the only candidates for organ donation.  when my 85-year-old mother passed away after a miserable decline involving multiple medical conditions, i was shocked that within minutes of her death, i was approached about offering her body for organ donation.  after i was informed that the whites of her eyes, parts of her bones and parts of her skin could be used for a variety of donor procedures, i immediately consented.  those who would like to be organ donors but fear they are too old should make their wishes known to their families, and keep their organ-donor cards with them.  anne lagrange loving  ridgewood, n.j., jan. 16, 2007

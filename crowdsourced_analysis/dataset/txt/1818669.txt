sitting down to falafel   to the editor: mark bittman's ''paris: l'as du fallafel'' (bites, dec. 31) was evocative of many delicious falafel sandwiches we have purchased, if not at l'as du fallafel, then at one of the other excellent falafel purveyors on rue de rosiers.  however, we have not found it necessary to eat standing up. there is a tiny but charming park, a short distance to the west, where one may eat while sitting on a bench. walk to the end of the street, turn right onto rue vieille du temple and take the first left onto clos des blancs manteaux. about 22 yards down you will find the park in question.  enid and irving kushner  shaker heights, ohio

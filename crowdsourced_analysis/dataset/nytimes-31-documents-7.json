            "text": "  FOR years, the noise, vibration and fumes from Long Island Rail Road trains idling on a track siding in the Village of Patchogue have been a nuisance to residents. But after the installation of an automated signal system last May, the idling trains are now virtually in some residents' backyards.  Jack Eddington, a Suffolk County legislator whose district includes Patchogue, said a six-foot chain-link fence is all that separates the trains from the backyards of homeowners on Academy Street.  ''The trains are literally 10 feet from their homes,'' he said.  Ann M. Goodhue, who lives on the opposite side of Academy Street, said she found the ''train situation atrocious.'' She said vibrations from three trains that sat idling on the siding several years ago cracked her second-floor ceiling.  Mr. Eddington said he had been at the siding when two trains were idling and found the noise very loud. ''And they give off a diesel smell,'' he said.  Until several years ago, the siding was about a mile west in a commercial area. Mr. Eddington said complaints from residents were fewer because a lumberyard and a bowling alley were on either side of the tracks and homes were far from the idling trains. But about six years ago, he said, trains were instructed to idle about three-quarters of a mile to the east, ''and it became a general nuisance because it was almost right in the middle of town.''  When a new signal system was installed last May about 200 to 300 feet farther east to align with a switch for the tracks, train engineers were instructed to idle there, said Susan McGowan, a railroad spokeswoman.  Mr. Eddington said that change put the trains ''right along the backyards of 12 or 13 homes'' on Academy Street.  ''I want the railroad to do the right thing'' for the residents, he said. ''I have looked up and down the track, and I see areas that don't have homes. I'm not telling them where they should go, but what I am saying is that where they are now is not acceptable.''  Ms. McGowan said that in an effort to ''minimize the inconvenience,'' the railroad had relocated two of six weekday trains that use the siding. One was moved 10 to 20 feet to the north siding, and a second was moved to a siding in Speonk.  ''These are the first steps we have taken,'' she said. ''We're continuing to look at the situation.''

            "text": "  WORK on replacing the Roslyn Viaduct is expected to continue unabated now that the contractor and the Village of Roslyn Harbor are near agreement on how to transport large concrete beams to the construction site.  The replacement of the three-quarter-mile-long viaduct, which was built in 1948 and carries Route 25A, known locally as Northern Boulevard, has long been planned. But Gerson Strassberg, the village mayor, said that village officials were not told until November that 412 large concrete sections of the bridge would be transported along Roslyn Harbor streets from midnight to 5 a.m.  The plan called for the beams, some weighing 60 tons, to be taken to Roslyn Harbor from Virginia by barge and then placed on a flatbed truck and driven 1.3 miles to the viaduct along Glenwood Road and Bryant Avenue.  Mr. Strassberg said that village officials were also not told that because of the height of the beams -- some of them 17 feet high -- utility wires along the truck route had to be raised to 22 feet off the ground and tree limbs had to be cut.  After four meetings with the contractor, the Tully Construction Company, of Flushing, Queens, and the State Department of Transportation, Mr. Strassberg said it was agreed to minimize inconvenience to the village by using other roads to transport the smaller beams to the viaduct.  The viaduct is a main section of Route 25A, carrying 38,000 vehicles a day, but it has no shoulders, the sightlines are poor, and heavy trucks are prohibited.  Gerard Terry of Jericho, the lawyer for Tully Construction, said plans agreed to on Dec. 20 called for only about 60 percent of the beams to be transported through the village. He said the route for the other beams had yet to be determined.  Plans call for four beams to be moved each night using two flatbed trucks making two trips each. Typically, Mr. Terry said, the shipments will be made on a weeknight.  ''So we will be making about 120 trips through the village over the course of one year, and each trip takes approximately 10 minutes,'' Mr. Terry said.  The company and the village were still completing their agreement, with hopes of beginning the truck runs sometime this month.  The $120 million project is scheduled for completion in 2008.

            "text": "  A battle between Yonkers and its neighbors over Ridge Hill Village, the $600 million residential, retail and commercial project the city wants to build near its border with the Town of Greenburgh, has gone quiet.  All sides have now settled a lawsuit that accused Yonkers of conducting an inadequate environmental review in its rush to greenlight the project, which will include 1,000 homes, 1.3 million square feet of retail space and who knows how many cars barrelling -- or crawling, as the case may be -- along the roads in and around it, including the Sprain Brook Parkway, the New York State Thruway and Tuckahoe Road.  As settlements go, it doesn't offer much for Yonkers's adversaries. Greenburgh, Hastings-on-Hudson, Ardsley and some residents of Yonkers itself had complained that traffic from Ridge Hill would engulf their streets. They wanted the city and the developer, Forest City Ratner (which is also building The Times's new headquarters in Manhattan), to scale back.  But that didn't happen. About all the settlement calls for is $5 million to mitigate traffic at certain intersections, and the creation of a task force to jointly lobby Westchester County and New York State to ease the traffic problem once and for all by creating a direct link to Ridge Hill from the Sprain Parkway.  Many people can support this solution in theory, but the obstacles to building it are significant. This is partly because the multimillion-dollar system of ramps and exits envisioned by the Yonkers City Council President, Chuck Lesnick, would have to cross a Westchester County park, and the county says it will sacrifice precious parkland to Ridge Hill at about the time hell freezes over.  In addition, the county has already raised serious questions about the scale and design of the so-called village, which it considers a closer cousin of a megamall. It insists further that offering a parkland boon to a private developer would set a catastrophic precedent with other builders and at other parks. The task force can lobby all it wants, the county says, but the Sprain Parkway ramps are roads to nowhere.  We love the idea of a regional task force -- of neighbors joining neighbors, crossing borders and putting heads together to solve development challenges that would otherwise lead to the usual endless and tiresome Westchester border wars.  But in the case of Ridge Hill, where so many problems could have been solved early on, with the City of Yonkers simply listening to its neighbors and working with Forest City Ratner to create a project on a more manageable scale, the great d\u00e9tente appears to have come too late.

            "text": "  About 5,000 parking spaces will be added at Metro-North train stations over the next few years, the State Department of Transportation said last week.  The department said 3,000 spaces would be for two new stations, one planned for the border of Orange and West Haven, which would get 2,000 spaces, and the other, a second station in Fairfield, near the Bridgeport line, which would get 1,000.  A new surface lot and two new decks to be built on the existing garage in Bridgeport would add 500 spaces; a planned multideck garage in Stratford would add 435; and another 100 would be on a deck to be built over the present lot in Wilton, the department said. As many as 1,000 spaces could also be added in New Haven.  Eugene J. Colonese, the department's rail administrator, said that the earliest that work on the new garages could begin would be this year in Bridgeport.  State Senator John McKinney, Republican of Fairfield, a member of the Legislature's transportation committee, said that 5,000 spaces would not be enough. He said other lots at stations between Stamford and Fairfield were also overcrowded.  In Westport, for example, the police said 930 people were waiting for about 1,500 reserved spaces at its Saugatuck and Greens Farms stations. They said the wait was about four years for a town resident and about six years for nonresidents.  Mr. McKinney said towns should develop plans for more parking and the state should make money available to help. ''We have $600 million committed to buying new rail cars to increase ridership on Metro-North, but we're not going to be able to do that if people can't park at the train station,'' he said.  Mr. Colonese said the transportation department was always looking for ways to add parking. ''We realize it is a constraint on ridership,'' he said.  JEFF HOLTZ  THE WEEK  ",

Michael S. Clendenin, a Con Ed spokesman, said that the line was essential to expand the capacity of the networks serving the area and that the proposed route was the most feasible.

Called the Lackawanna Cutoff, the proposed line is an 88-mile stretch of level ground that was once used by the Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad and later by Conrail, which abandoned its right of way more than two decades ago and removed the tracks. New Jersey Transit bought the land in 2001.  ''We're advancing this project, including public meetings this month,'' said Joe Dee, a New Jersey Transit spokesman. The plan has a projected cost of $551 million, not including the purchase of property for stations. An environmental assessment and conceptual design are due this year.  The Lackawanna Cutoff line would employ diesel-powered trains and have stops in Andover and Blairstown in New Jersey and Analomink, the Delaware Water Gap, East Stroudsburg, Pocono Mountain, Scranton and Tobyhanna in Pennsylvania.  It is not clear when service could begin. ''A timeline for future phases of the project will be contingent on funding availability,'' Mr. Dee said.  Mr. Dee said that the departure of George D. Warrington, who has said he is stepping down as executive director of New Jersey Transit at the end of March, would have no effect on the Lackawanna Cutoff project.  JOHN HOLL  THE WEEK  ",

            "text": "  Crowded, aging and dirty passenger cars, as well as disrepair and a parking shortage at some stations, were among the concerns cited in a report on the Metro-North and Shore Line East lines released last week by the Connecticut Rail Commuter Council, a riders' advocacy group.  James Cameron, the council's chairman, said some of the problems would not be solved until 2009, when the first of a batch of new rail cars purchased by the state are scheduled to be put into service.  ''All we can do is ask the commuters to be patient and know that help is coming down the track,'' he said. ''It just hasn't pulled into the station yet.''  Judd Everhart, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation, which runs Metro-North with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said in a statement that some of the problems were being addressed.  ''We know our commuters face challenges every day, and we are doing something about it,'' he said.  In the past two years, Mr. Everhart said, Gov. M. Jodi Rell and the General Assembly committed more than $3 billion to transportation improvements throughout the state. ''The funding is in place and the work is under way,'' he said.  The report said the quality of service of the Shore Line East commuter railroad, which runs weekdays between New London and New Haven and is operated by Amtrak and the State Transportation Department, was good but that the service should be expanded to seven days a week.  The report did, however, praise Metro-North for a 97 percent on-time rate last year.  The annual report, which is mandated by the legislation that created the commuter council in 1985, is available at trainweb.org/ct.  Arena and Jai Alai Fronton Meeting the Wrecking Ball  During their heydays in the 1970s and '80s, they were filled to the rafters with thousands of cheering spectators. But last week, only the sound of demolition equipment and walls coming down could be heard at the New Haven Coliseum and Milford Jai Alai.  The coliseum was scheduled for implosion on Jan. 20. The demolition of the fronton, or jai alai court, began in earnest last week and was scheduled to last until the spring.  The coliseum, which opened in 1972 and closed in 2002, was known for its rock concerts and for being the home of the New Haven Nighthawks, an American Hockey League team that is defunct.  The city said the Long Wharf Theater would move to the four-acre property being vacated by the coliseum. It said the site would include an expansion of the nearby Knights of Columbus headquarters, as well as retail space and housing.  Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven said the coliseum had outlived it usefulness. ''It was once state of the art in the marketplace, and was the only venue in the marketplace, but economic models change,'' he said.  Mayor James L. Richetelli Jr. of Milford said the fronton, which from 1977 to 2001 featured parimutuel betting on jai alai, a speedy handball-like game, had put the city ''on the map.'' In just six months in 1988, it had revenues of $100 million.  ''In the early years, people came from all over and filled up our restaurants and hotels,'' he said. ''It's going to be strange to not see it there anymore.''  Mr. Richetelli said that in November, the city sold the 25-acre jai alai property to Starwood Ceruzzi, a development company, for $14 million, after having bought it from the owners for $12.6 million in 2004. He said the company planned to build a Lowe's home improvement store, a hotel and other retail space there.  ",

            "text": "  Ten years after the closing of the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, one of the largest psychiatric facilities in the country, a new plan for its redevelopment has been approved.  After a judge dismissed a lawsuit over the sale of the land to a housing developer, state officials agreed Dec. 28 on a new plan to transfer the property to the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for use as parkland.  A total of 368 acres will be added to Nissequogue River State Park, and 90 acres will be set aside for development. A separate 2.6 acres will be used by the Kings Park Fire District, and 36 acres will remain with the Office of Mental Health.  Land where vacant buildings now stand will be leased to a developer, providing revenue to the park system.  The transfer of the property was made possible when Judge Elizabeth Hazlitt Emerson of State Supreme Court in Riverhead dismissed a lawsuit on Dec. 15 that had been filed by the Arker Companies and Cherokee Northeast. Her ruling canceled the sale of the property to the developers, who had proposed 1,800 units of town houses and condominiums.  The transfer to the state supersedes a proposal by State Senator John J. Flanagan, who had secured $25 million from the state to clean up the site and had been working to transfer the property to the Town of Smithtown. He called the revised plan ''a terrific opportunity for the residents of Kings Park.''  ''It protects taxpayers by preserving tax payments to the Kings Park School District and preserves the open space of this beautiful parcel of land,'' Mr. Flanagan said.  Not everyone was as supportive. Patrick R. Vecchio, the Smithtown supervisor, said: ''It had been our hope that the land left for development would be transferred to the town so we could control our own destiny. Now we have no control over the 90 acres, and we are back to Square One.''  THE WEEK  ",

            "text": "  The Town of Oyster Bay is beginning a new effort to protect its waterfront, announcing intentions to create a master plan for the eastern waterfront in the hamlet of Oyster Bay.  Using a $37,250 matching grant from the state's Environmental Protection Fund, the town hired a consultant to oversee the plan and appointed a steering committee, composed of representatives from local governments as well as environmental, civic and community groups.  The eastern waterfront includes commercial, residential and town property. The study will address issues like improving public access and establishing connections between downtown and the community; providing easier public access to the waterfront and the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Park and Beach; and providing easier access for transient boaters to downtown.  John Venditto, the town supervisor, said the plan was ''the last piece of a puzzle'' to protect the area's environmental resources and preserve the community character with sensible economic growth. He said that in the past 10 years the town had received $8.5 million in grants from the state for studies and work on waterfront projects -- a western waterfront plan and an Oyster Bay hamlet plan.  The western waterfront plan includes a 9/11 memorial park, a new fishing pier and the eventual replacement of two buildings at a shipyard that were razed. The hamlet plan includes new street lighting and paving and redesigned storefronts.  LINDA SASLOW  THE WEEK  ",

            "text": "  IT was big news in the town of Smithtown in Suffolk County when, just before the New Year rolled in, 368 acres of land at a former state psychiatric institution in Kings Park were transformed into state parkland.  The property had been in dispute since the hospital closed in 1996, as a lawsuit sought to force the state to sell the land to a developer who planned to build as many as 1,800 homes there.  But the suit was dismissed in December by a New York State Supreme Court justice, and control of the land was transferred from the state Office of Mental Health to the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.  ''If you look at the land, it doesn't make sense to build housing,'' said Linda Henninger, president of the Kings Park Neighbors' Association, a local civic group that has opposed a housing development.  She said that the development would have broken up expanses of parkland surrounding it and that new residents in such an oddly placed subdivision would have clogged the hamlet's narrow roads.  The property, which has views of Long Island Sound, will now become part of Nissequogue River State Park, a forested 153-acre parcel next door that was also once part of the hospital -- although 90 acres of it could still be developed with park-related infrastructure like a pool. The transfer is ''great for the North Shore, and it's a beautiful park,'' Ms. Henninger said.  In the 1990s, as evolving treatment methods ended the practice of mass isolation of the mentally ill, Kings Park and other large state-run psychiatric hospitals on Long Island were shut down.  These institutions, including Pilgrim State and Edgewood State Hospital in Dix Hills and Deer Park and Central Islip Psychiatric Center, were small, self-contained cities. At their peak in the 1950s, tens of thousands of patients lived in residential buildings on the four sites, which had their own laundry and power plants, playing fields, swimming pools and other facilities. The hospitals employed hundreds of residents of local towns and hamlets.  The state shutdown left unemployment, large swaths of land and decaying buildings.  In Central Islip, the state transferred control of the land to the encompassing town of Islip. It hired developers to build attached town houses, which were sold at affordable prices. Parts of the hospital campus were also sold, for development of federal court buildings, a minor-league baseball stadium, shopping centers, offices and a technical college.  Those developments were made possible in large part by the existence of a local sewer system; the lack of such a system in Kings Park would make development more difficult and expensive.  Officials in Smithtown, who were working with State Senator John Flanagan on an effort to persuade the state to transfer the land to the town, were unprepared for the transfer of the land to the State Parks Department.  ''It took everybody by surprise,'' Frank DeRubeis, planning director of Smithtown, said of the state's move to make the land state parkland.  The town has been waiting 10 years for contaminated soil on the site to be cleaned up. It had also been studying a plan, financed by Suffolk County, to spur development in downtown Kings Park and downtown Smithtown by expanding local sewage capacity with an underground leeching field on the psychiatric center property, Mr. DeRubeis said.  ''Now it seems that whole thing is dead,'' he added.  The Kings Park Psychiatric Medical Center opened in 1885 as a rural branch of the Kings County Asylum in Brooklyn and was transferred to New York State 10 years later. In 1955, 9,300 patients were living there.  Three years after the hospital closed, 153 acres of the grounds were transferred to the Parks Department to create the Nissequogue River State Park, named for the river that runs through it.  The Office of Mental Health still operates two group homes and one residential care center for adults on 36 acres not transferred to the parks office. There are no plans to close these facilities.  From the community's point of view, it would seem there is little downside to the recent transfer. New York State pays taxes to the local schools under an arrangement that nets the district more than $5 million a year, according to Mr. Flanagan. About $2 million of that comes from the former psychiatric hospital property.  Since the state will continue owning the land, it will ''keep on paying those taxes on the land,'' he said.  That tax arrangement is unusual. It is dictated by Section 536 of New York's Real Property Tax Law, according to Jill Daniels, a spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Mental Health. The school districts in the same category as Kings Park are listed in the text of the law.  ''Parkland is our 'industrial,' '' said Ms. Henninger, the civic group president, alluding to the zoning category that in some towns brings in significant tax revenue. ''We get a lot of money for beautiful trees.''  But before the hospital land is completely beautiful, the soil contaminated by the power plant and landfills on the site still has to be cleaned up. Last March, Mr. Flanagan said, the state budget appropriated $25 million to help with the project, which could cost $40 million to $60 million.  When the Empire State Development Corporation first requested proposals from developers, all of their plans called for high concentrations of housing to help cover the cleanup costs.  But that did not sit well with town officials. ''We felt all along that the developments were unacceptable because the state was selling to a developer, then walking away and leaving us with all that density,'' said Mr. DeRubeis, the planning director.  There remain 90 acres of the transferred land that hold abandoned psychiatric center buildings and could still be developed once the area is cleaned up. But Mr. Flanagan said such development would have to be ''consistent with the mission of a park.''  For example, he said, one leftover building has an Olympic-size swimming pool and could become part of a community center if it were repaired and renovated.  Or, as at the historic Glen Iris Inn in Letchworth State Park in Castile, N.Y., or the lodge in Bear Mountain State Park, ''we could make a beautiful bed and breakfast,'' he said.

            "text": "  OF all the Staten Islanders who pass under the powder blue arches of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, few know it better than John Guzzo. Mr. Guzzo, who lives in Rosebank, just north of the bridge's tolls, drives a dump truck all over the region, paying a truck rate of $38 each time he re-enters his borough, which he often does five times a day.  ''I've been here since we used to pay 50 cents for the bridge,'' Mr. Guzzo said recently, talking on a cellphone while hauling a load in Commack, N.Y.  Talk of change is now in the air -- except that the topic is not the size of the toll but the way it is paid. Currently, cars pay $9 to cross the bridge from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, into Staten Island, and nothing to leave. The idea is to charge drivers $4.50 in each direction. The aim is to deter New Jersey-bound drivers from skirting tolls entirely by crossing the Verrazano into Brooklyn free of charge, and then driving into Manhattan and entering New Jersey via the Holland Tunnel, which is also toll-less in that direction.  The two-way toll is on the table again: The Staten Island Advance reported this month that Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat whose district comprises parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, planned to reintroduce a bill in Congress to establish it. Mr. Nadler unsuccessfully proposed such legislation in Congress in 1999, 2001 and 2003, and in a recent interview he said he would like to start new talks with local officials about the idea.  Reaction on Staten Island to the two-way option, which was official policy until traffic concerns led to its elimination in 1986, has not been kind. According to Mr. Guzzo, who is also vice president of the Rosebank Homeowners and Tenants Association, people in the area don't want tollbooths both ways because they are certain that traffic would back up onto the service roads near their homes.  Several Staten Island officials, including Borough President James Molinaro, also expressed opposition.  ''Congressman, changing the toll on the Verrazano will not alleviate this historic problem,'' Mr. Molinaro wrote to Mr. Nadler on Jan. 9. ''However, it has the potential to certainly create more gridlock for Staten Islanders.''  But Mr. Nadler said that drivers who skirt the toll save $75 million to $90 million a year, and securing that money would finance much-needed local transit projects.  ''I'd like to talk to Chuck about this,'' Mr. Nadler said, referring to Senator Charles Schumer.

In addition, he said, E-ZPass technology could minimize the traffic effects of a two-way toll. ''With modern E-ZPass,'' he said, ''you can go through at 50 miles per hour without slowing down.''

            "text": "  To the Editor:  In his Op-Ed article about the Hudson Valley (''Mr. Spitzer's Valley,'' Jan. 7), Ned Sullivan of Scenic Hudson discusses possibilities for ''smart'' development there, including ''smart'' transportation in the expansion of Stewart Airport as the fourth major downstate airport.  If ever there were a worse proposal for the region, it escapes me. The only reason such a proposal is even surfacing is the paucity of decent train service in New York State. Mr. Sullivan doesn't even acknowledge the need to upgrade the railroads in the area. If we had fast, convenient and reliable train service between New York and Chicago and other Eastern cities, there would not even be the need to expand Stewart.  Mr. Sullivan also does not mention the need for public transportation in the immediate region. The overwhelmed parking lots at the Poughkeepsie train station and others up and down the valley attest to the absence of such a service. Until attention is paid to these essential requirements for ''smart development,'' expansion of any aspect of such development will be detrimental to the fundamental health of the region.  Carol H.

            "text": "  Gritty freight trains may be a familiar sight out West and in cowboy movies, but in Queens and Brooklyn and the neat suburbs of Long Island, they are a roaring, sooty cause for a big double take.  ''We go through here every day, and everyone still looks at us like 'What the heck is this?' '' said Tom Materka, a rail freight engineer, as the train approached the Hicksville station, one of the Long Island Rail Road's busiest commuter stops, one recent afternoon. ''People are always shocked to see a freight train coming through here.''  Mr. Materka, 30, an engineer for the New York & Atlantic Railway, one of the few remaining short-line rail freight companies in the region, was running two screaming 120-ton diesel locomotives towing a string of sooty boxcars from Queens out to eastern Long Island. Well-dressed commuters looked up from their newspapers and coffee and stared as the smoky train roared by and transformed the suburban station into Tumbleweed Junction.  The line uses obscure rail tracks in Queens and Brooklyn and tracks of the Long Island Rail Road in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.  Since freight trains are far outnumbered by commuter trains, few people glimpse the bulky, graffiti-covered boxcars as they lumber past the sleek silver commuter cars rushing passengers to or from Pennsylvania Station.  But passengers can expect to see more of these trains soon. Transportation experts, government officials and rail freight advocates say conditions are suddenly in their favor.  New York's new governor, Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, favors expanding rail freight, as does United States Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Mr. Nadler, a longtime champion of building a rail freight tunnel under New York Harbor to reduce truck traffic, helped obtain $100 million in federal money in 2005 to study the tunnel project, and his power has increased now that the Democrats have a majority in Congress.  Given that political climate, and the effect high fuel costs have on prices of goods trucked in, experts say they expect a huge increase in rail cargo in the New York area. The city gets roughly 2 percent of its goods by rail, compared with a 40 percent average figure nationally, experts say.  Also, a new waste management plan for New York City calls for more reliance on rail freight to ship waste out. The city is set to activate a rail freight line on Staten Island and is seeking to expand rail activity in Bay Ridge, where a short-line railroad floats rail cars from New Jersey across New York Harbor to Brooklyn to be picked up by New York & Atlantic.  Since taking over the Long Island Rail Road's freight operation in 1997, New York & Atlantic has managed to navigate the tricky, obscure rail tracks in Queens and Brooklyn and dodge the thick traffic of the Long Island Rail Road, the busiest commuter line in the country. Annual totals have increased to about 22,000 carloads last year from 9,000 in 1997.  This little-noticed suburban rail line has become the little engine that could, and proposed increases in rail freight could thrust it into a much larger role, as would plans to create new depots on Long Island to reduce truck traffic on the Long Island Expressway.  ''Rail freight is expanding here and we're going to grow with it,'' said New York & Atlantic's general manager, Mark Westerfield. ''We're connected to the national network, and the rest of the country relies on rail freight.''  Operations are limited by the size of the main yard at Fresh Pond Junction in Glendale, Queens, he said, and by the capacity and condition of the tracks, overpasses and aging signal systems for the line's fleet of 13 locomotives, some of them a half-century old. Mr. Westerfield said he was seeking government money to help the railway expand operations.  The company has 10 years left on its exclusive contract with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for track use; after that, it has the right to renew for another 20 years, he said. One morning this month at the Fresh Pond yard, next to a neighborhood of homes, a crew connected the 50-foot-long hoppers and boxcars to be delivered to Long Island: baking flour headed to Lindenhurst, oats bound for Belmont Park racetrack, plastic pellets and bricks headed for Hicksville, and chicken feed for Eastport.  The conductor, Jeremy Lally, 31, of Bohemia, on Long Island, and his burly brakeman, Sean McCarthy, 29, of Huntington, swung on and off the train and threw hand switches, just as in old movies. Mr. Materka, of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, nimbly handled a set of old valves and heavy handles on the control stand, to maneuver the diesel from track to track, picking up the cars by ramming into their massive steel couplings.  The other two men hoisted themselves up the steep metal steps onto the hulking locomotive and along a catwalk into the engine's cab, and soon the train was chugging east toward the Jamaica rail hub, carefully avoiding the path of oncoming rush-hour commuters speeding toward Penn Station.  The winter sun streaked through the locomotive cab's narrow windows as Mr. Lally thumbed through his huge book of rail schedules to see which trains were ahead and behind them.  Passenger trains have priority, and the freight conductor's biggest priority is finding gaps in the commuter train schedule. Mr. Lally constantly called and radioed to control towers to see when the train could pass through stations between commuter trains, while Mr. Materka pulled the near-deafening horn incessantly to warn cars and pedestrians at traffic crossings.  The freight line, with its 10 train crews on duty each day, serves about 80 businesses in Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island. It extends to Bridgehampton on the South Fork of Long Island and Southold on the North Fork. Its cargo includes produce, lumber, asphalt, paper, plastics, rice, beer, onions, road salt, building materials, recyclables, chemicals, iron, steel.  Most cars come down from upstate New York or Connecticut through the Bronx, across the Hell Gate Bridge over the East River, and through Queens. They pass highways and dense urban landscape and, as the Manhattan skyline recedes, the scenery turns to a blur of backyards, ball fields and strip malls.  The locomotive is a 2,000-horsepower diesel, about 30 years old, with a 3,000-gallon diesel fuel capacity. Two or three locomotives are usually hitched together so that the huge train can accelerate to avoid the commuter trains.  The crew members hopped out to throw large levers connected to antiquated-looking track switches, to allow the train to enter various sidings and yards for deliveries and pickups.  Many spur lines and off-ramps are now rusted and overgrown, but lately the crew members have seen signs of revival, as some companies build new sidings to make way for rail service.  ",

            "text": "  Transit officials announced the formation of a task force yesterday to improve safety along unfenced tracks on the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road.  The officials were joined at a news conference in Long Island City, Queens, by City Councilman Eric N. Gioia and by Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who announced $500,000 in federal financing to aid in the effort. Mr. Weiner also promised to introduce legislation to seek $20 million that communities could request to build fences along tracks.  He said the bill would be called ''Ari's Law'' after Ari Kraft, 13, a Queens junior high student killed by a Long Island Rail Road train on Jan. 5 while painting graffiti on elevated tracks in Rego Park.  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority oversees the two railroads, which comprise more than 244 stations and 1,400 miles of track, only a small portion of which is fenced.  The goals of the task force include finding ways to improve the existing barriers and working with elected officials to get money for more fencing, said the authority's new executive director, Elliot G. Sander.  Correction:  February 2, 2007, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the formation of a task force to improve safety along unfenced tracks of the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road, where a Queens boy was struck and killed this month, gave an erroneous spelling in some copies for the surname of a New York City councilman who appeared at a news conference on the task force.

            "text": "  SOME see the long-closed Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge as a 6,767-foot-long rusting relic. Others envision a gleaming pedestrian walkway, offering spectacular views of the Hudson Valley.  It is that vision that inspires members of Walkway Over the Hudson, a nonprofit group dedicated to building the walkway and reopening the bridge so that strollers and cyclists can experience firsthand what has captivated railroad enthusiasts and history buffs, not to mention politicians and writers, for decades.  Fixing up the bridge -- the first to span the Hudson south of Albany -- is something of an obsession for David Rocco, a retired carpenter from Yorktown and a member of Walkway. Mr. Rocco said the bridge combines three of his favorite things: train tracks that can be converted to public pathways, railroad history and ''the beautiful Hudson River.''  ''It's the trifecta for me,'' he said.  Walkway, which has owned the bridge since 1998, would love to reopen it in the spring of 2009 to coincide with the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's first trip up the river. The challenges are considerable; most glaring is the more than $10 million -- some estimates run as high as $30 million -- needed to build a walkway from the charred remains of a fire that closed the bridge in 1974, as well as pay for other additions, like an elevator.  The bridge, which is parallel to the Mid-Hudson Bridge, was completed in 1888, five years after the Brooklyn Bridge opened. It initially served passengers and freight and was the primary rail route for goods traveling from New England to points west of the Hudson. After the completion of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City in 1917, its role diminished. It was being used strictly for freight when the 1974 fire torched the railroad ties on the Poughkeepsie side, warping the rails. The bridge never carried another train.  Fred Schaeffer, a Poughkeepsie lawyer who is Walkway's president, said the bridge -- an Erector Set-like structure that climbs out of the Hudson like a black skeleton -- deserves better. ''The bridge helped this country grow,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. ''It tied this country together.''  Now, Mr. Schaeffer simply hopes the bridge will tie the Hudson Valley together. Walkway members see it as the centerpiece connecting bike paths and green space, with shops and restaurants dotting the surrounding areas.  Whether it is all a pipe dream should become clearer in coming months, when an engineering firm hired by Walkway completes a feasibility study. In November, as part of the study, inspectors in wetsuits found the bridge's underwater piers to be sound, but the structure is in dire need of a paint job, and building a walkway some 212 feet above the Hudson will not be done by weekend volunteers.  The group also hopes to build an elevator to the walkway in Poughkeepsie's Waryas Park, near the city's Metro-North station, a children's museum and a cluster of restaurants.  An $874,000 grant from the federal government in 2005 was a big step, as was $155,000 from the governor's office. The City of Poughkeepsie also ripped up a $550,000 tax lien that Walkway had inherited from the bridge's previous owner. Mayor Nancy Cozean said she saw the project as a metaphor for older cities looking to reinvent themselves.  Still, Mr. Rocco concedes that the group is far from its financial goal. He hopes to make up the difference with a mix of city, county and state funds, along with private donations. The local congressman, Maurice Hinchey, said he was doing everything he could to make sure the project was financed. ''I'm absolutely certain this is going to go,'' he said.  Something about the bridge and the views of the Hudson it provides seem to inspire optimism. ''Standing atop that deserted railbed was among the most humbling experiences I've ever had,'' said Robert Klara, a writer and railroad historian who walked over the bridge in the early '90s. ''Views notwithstanding, there's a kind of industrial lyricism to the bridge's trusses, rivets and crossbars. Even as a ruin, it's a thing of great beauty.''  Local residents say anything meant to spur tourism has their support. Enjoying an unseasonably warm January day in Waryas Park, in the shadow of the bridge, William Durling said he was intrigued by the project.  ''It'd be excellent for the city to rejuvenate the bridge,'' he said.  LANDMARKS  ",

The accident happened around 8:30 a.m. as workers were demolishing an eight-story commercial building at 587 River Avenue. City officials said the laborer, Carlos Reinoso, of Jackson Heights, Queens, was using a Bobcat excavator to push a concrete beam over the building's side, and fell after the beam snagged the Bobcat and dragged it over the edge. The contractor, Bedroc Contracting, was issued a citation alleging unsafe practices. Bedroc's managing partner, Frank Weidner, said in a statement that his company was also looking into the accident. The police said no charges would be filed.  CARA BUCKLEY  ",

            "text": "  WHEN Gerald J. Tarantolo, the mayor of Eatontown, N.J., places a price tag on the 452 acres of land his town hopes to acquire when Fort Monmouth closes, he is not exaggerating.  ''Hopefully, $1 will be able to pay for it,'' he said. ''After all, we do have a long history with Fort Monmouth.''  The fort -- established in 1917 as Camp Little Silver and renamed in 1925 in honor of Revolutionary War soldiers who died in the battle of Monmouth Court House -- is scheduled to close by Sept. 20, 2011, part of an effort to cut military spending.  When the fences come down, Eatontown and the neighboring Monmouth County boroughs of Oceanport and Tinton Falls could inherit and divide 1,126 acres of Fort Monmouth property within their borders.  Mr. Tarantolo and the other mayors, Lucille Chaump of Oceanport and Peter Maclearie of Tinton Falls, are considering how best to use the property, which not only would alter their existing landscapes but could also have a major economic impact.  The Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Planning Authority, a 10-member panel that includes the three mayors, must approve plans for the land. The authority is required to make its decision by Dec. 8.  ''With this additional land, Eatontown will grow by 11 percent,'' Mr. Tarantolo said. ''The initial mind-set is to just expand on what we already have, but that might not be the way to pursue this. By growing, you run into a lot of problems, like providing new schools, enlarging your police force and maybe even expanding the Public Works Department.''  According to Mr. Tarantolo, Eatowntown's piece of the Fort Monmouth pie would include 486 units of vacant military housing, an 18-hole golf course, a football complex with a track and a 20-lane bowling center.  While Eatontown and Oceanport hope to share a fitness center that includes an indoor swimming pool, a gymnasium, a weight room and two racquetball courts, Oceanport's potential bonanza includes a marina and a parade ground that could be used for general recreation.  ''We've hired a planner to help us look at this space,'' said Ms. Chaump, who said she expected 419 acres. ''We're going to have town meetings to discuss housing, open space, commercial space, traffic and anything else regarding this expansion.''  With Oceanport receiving the smallest parcel -- roughly 252 acres, including an outdoor swimming pool -- Mr. Maclearie said his preference ''would not be to expand but to keep the extra land as open space.''  The mayors want the federal government to turn over large areas -- a combined 352 acres -- through what is called a public benefit conveyance, or as Ms. Chaump put it, ''a 100 percent discount.'' Although the remaining 774 acres would belong to the towns, the Defense Department would seek fair-market value from anyone who wants to build there.  Ms. Chaump said that if the planning authority approves handing over the land to the towns, the Fort Monmouth Open Space and Recreation Resources Group -- which plans open-space use and which the three mayors belong to -- will decide how best to maintain the additional land.  The towns, along with any government agency or nonprofit group seeking free or reduced-price facilities, have until March 8 to make their best pitches for the land.  Mr. Tarantolo said his $1 bid would be accompanied by a reminder that since the late 1950s, Eatontown has ''accepted the responsibility of paying the bill to educate the children of military dependents.''  He said that if the land conveyance occurs, all three towns ''will really need professional land consultants to help us through this transition.''  ''Essentially, when Fort Monmouth closes, it will become three towns, and we must all figure out how we will reuse this land,'' he said. ''We all have a lot of studying to do.''  DEVELOPMENT  Correction:  February 4, 2007, Sunday  An article last Sunday about plans for the property at Fort Monmouth, N.J., after it is closed misidentified the borough that would receive the smallest parcel, of 252 acres, and whose mayor prefers to keep the land as open space. It is Tinton Falls -- whose mayor is Peter Maclearie -- not Oceanport.  ",

Earlier this month, Mr. Suozzi called for comments from the public, civic organizations, environmental groups and government officials to develop a list of projects to finance under the $100 million Environmental Program Bond Act that voters approved in November. He appointed an advisory committee to evaluate the projects. Nominations begin Thursday and continue until March 15.  ''The more information given, the better,'' said Thomas F. Maher, the director of environmental coordination for Nassau County. ''If a group wants to improve a parkland area to provide recreational opportunities for disadvantaged kids, that's helpful information to provide.''  This Environmental Program Bond Act follows one in 2004 for $50 million, which received 260 nominations. Forty-seven of those were selected.  Mr. Maher said he was expecting more nominations this time. ''There seems to be more interest after the success of the first bond act,'' he said. ''And now we have double the money to spend.''  Just as the county did with the first environmental act, it could finance projects in open space acquisition, parkland improvement, storm water quality improvement and brownfield remediation, Mr. Maher said.  With money left from the 2004 bond act, the county recently bought two properties: the 33-acre Boegner estate in Old Westbury and the 3-acre Parkway Drive property in Baldwin, which includes wetlands.

            "text": "  The 20-year building boom on Staten Island, long the city's fastest-growing borough, is decelerating drastically, thanks largely to a reining-in of the island's freewheeling zoning laws, officials say. According to city figures released yesterday, permits for new buildings plunged by 43 percent last year.  So substantial was the decline that Staten Island almost single-handedly accounted for a 10 percent dip in building permits citywide last year, which was the first drop in the city in a decade.  In the other four boroughs, permits fell by 1.6 percent, the figures from the City Buildings Department show.  Of course, the real estate market has been cooling all over the city and the country, but city officials and real estate professionals attributed the disproportionate chill on Staten Island to zoning and tax changes.  New zoning rules passed in 2004, which were aimed at stemming a flood of town house developments that residents complained were disfiguring communities and overloading streets with traffic, require larger lots and yards and more parking. A tax abatement for new one- and two-family homes was also rescinded last year, further discouraging construction.  ''It's one of these perfect-storm situations,'' said Sandy Krueger, chief executive officer of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. ''Everything kind of came together at once: the downzoning, the tax abatement removal and the change in the market. I think everybody is sort of taking a breath here and waiting this out a little bit to see what happens.''  Last year, 826 permits for new buildings were issued in Staten Island, compared with 1,441 in 2005 and nearly 2,000 in 2003. Permits for new units of housing also declined more than 40 percent through November, compared with a 1 percent drop elsewhere in the city, according to census statistics.  The downturn was broadly welcomed in a place where for years development appeared to proceed with pile driver and shoehorn. A one-acre parcel where 18 units of housing could once be built is limited to 7.  ''I don't want Staten Island to stop growing,'' said the borough president, James P. Molinaro, who helped lead the drive for the zoning changes, ''but I want proper growth.''  The decline in new housing permits issued on Staten Island affected multifamily dwellings as well as smaller buildings. Permits for one-family homes fell 49 percent.  City officials pointed to several developments planned for the island that they said would be more carefully managed, including a 700-unit waterfront complex in Stapleton, north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which is expected to bring new life to a vacant port.  As for the slight citywide drop in new building and housing permits outside of Staten Island, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff, said he saw little cause for concern. New housing construction is slowing dramatically across the country, he said, and total construction spending in New York City is increasing as builders focus on commercial projects.  ''Particularly relative to the overall national housing market,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''and taking into account the fact that through much of the year interest rates were rising, I think by every indicator the market here was very resilient.''  Frank Naso, one of Staten Island's biggest builders and the former president of the Building Industry Association of New York City, a trade group, said that zoning changes had been long overdue.  ''We needed some kind of reform,'' he said. ''We'll continue to build, but instead of building 10 you might build 6. It's not the end of the world.''  Mr. Naso was more upset about the loss of the tax abatement, which cut a homeowner's property taxes for the first eight years after purchase and allowed many first-time buyers into the market.  Jeff Gallo, an opponent of sprawl and a member of the Preservation League of Staten Island, who lives in a turn-of-the-century Victorian house in Stapleton, said he had noticed a slight calming in the air.  ''There's a feeling out in Staten Island now that you just can't get away with everything,'' said Mr. Gallo, a real estate broker who works in Brooklyn.  Ever since the Verrazano-Narrows bridge was completed in 1964, linking Staten Island to the rest of New York City, people have flocked to the island, developers have worked frenetically to accommodate them, and longtime residents have bemoaned the disappearance of open space and the strain on the island's infrastructure. During the 1990s, Staten Island's population grew by 17 percent and civic discontent skyrocketed. Eventually the clamor brought results.  Before the zoning change, you were permitted to build a house with a 4-foot backyard,'' Mr. Molinaro said. ''Now you have to have a minimum of 30 feet. You were able to buy a house on Staten Island where your bottom step was the street -- there was no sidewalk. That was legal! You can't do it no more.''  Staten Island, still by far the least-populous borough in the city, was the fastest-growing county in the state, according to the 2000 census.  It is not even the fastest-growing borough in the city anymore, having fallen into a virtual tie with Manhattan. From 2003 to 2005, the population in both boroughs grew by about 0.9 percent, according to census estimates.  Helen Siegel, 52, a schoolteacher who lives in New Springville, in the center of the island, thought back yesterday to the days when cows and pigs from nearby farms used to stroll across her yard.  ''It might have been better had they done this sooner,'' she said. ''It's all built up on every spare inch of land already.''  ",

Here's a newsflash: There are people who have grown up in Long Island City who are successful, literate folks who would like to live out their years here. They also like being off the hip map. Non-New Yorkers have already ruined Williamsburg and Little Italy, and are now spilling over into Long Island City.  This city has become gentrified enough.

            "text": "  It's a common enough thought among city drivers inching through traffic: Everyone around me came from the suburbs, making my life miserable. But it's wrong, because more than half the drivers who crowd into Manhattan each workday come from the five boroughs.  That is only one fact about traffic in New York City that may surprise some people. For example, 35 percent of government workers drive to work, many because they have free parking. Also, one in five drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan are only passing through, on their way somewhere else.  Finally, many drivers say that they simply prefer the convenience and solitude of their own vehicles and have found ways to get around the worst congestion.  By examining a wealth of data collected by government agencies, a detailed and often surprising portrait of traffic in New York City emerges.  ''There's a lot of myths, and when you look at the data, the myths go pop, pop, pop, one by one,'' said Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant who has studied regional traffic patterns.  Traffic, and competing proposals for what to do about it, will probably receive more attention in the coming months as the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg creates a plan to accommodate the city's expected growth over the next 25 years of one million more residents, many of them with cars.  ''The fascinating thing about traffic,'' Mr. Schaller said, ''is there are so many different strands.''  One of the most prevalent beliefs to crumble beneath the data might be called the suburban myth, the notion that suburbanites make up a majority of the commuters who drive to work in Manhattan.  Census data show that more city residents than suburbanites drive to work in Manhattan every day, according to Mr. Schaller. He estimated that 263,000 people in 19 counties in and around New York City drive regularly to jobs in Manhattan below 60th Street. Of those, 53 percent, or 141,000, live in the five boroughs, Mr. Schaller said. The greatest numbers are from Queens, with 51,300, and Brooklyn, with 33,400. About 23,900 auto commuters live in Manhattan, while 17,400 are from the Bronx and 15,200 from Staten Island. The suburban area with the most auto commuters to Manhattan is Nassau County, with 22,091 people driving to work in the borough, followed by Bergen County, with 19,975.  When plotted on a map, the data make a striking picture, showing that some of the densest concentrations of auto commuters are from the outer fringes of Queens and Brooklyn, where access to subways is limited.  ''The concentration of auto commuters is in areas that don't have direct subway service,'' Mr. Schaller said. ''So the travel time advantage of driving is greater than it is in the rest of the city.''  That applies to Dennis Alicea, of Bayside, Queens. Mr. Alicea, a banker for JPMorgan Chase & Company, drives from Bayside to Manhattan, where he first takes his daughter to school on the East Side. Then he leaves his car at a lot, which charges early arrivals about $10 a day for parking, and takes a bus to his office in Midtown. He said he typically arrives at work about one hour after leaving home.  To commute on public transportation, Mr. Alicea, 38, would have to take a bus from his home to the Long Island Rail Road station at Bayside, ride a train to Pennsylvania Station, then take a subway back to the East Side. ''You have to go into a stuffy, overcrowded train with people with attitudes,'' he said. ''I prefer driving for the peace of mind. It's much easier.''  An annual survey conducted by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, an association of government agencies involved in transportation planning, recorded 810,000 vehicles (not including buses) entering Manhattan below 60th Street on a single weekday in 2003. That figure has increased fairly steadily over the years, largely in line with changes in the city's economy and population. The 2003 count was 6 percent greater than 1993, when 760,000 vehicles were recorded, and 24 percent greater than 1978, when there were 649,000.  The number dropped after the terror attack in 2001 but has been rising since. Partial data released from the 2004 count show a total of 815,000 vehicles entering the area of Manhattan covered by the survey.  This data help bust another myth. ''A lot of people say, 'It's those Jersey drivers,' '' said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association, a group that studies development and transportation issues. ''But when you look at the numbers, the Long Island sector is by far the largest sector where cars are coming from into the city.''  According to the 2003 data, 110,000 vehicles entered Manhattan through the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels the day the survey was taken. An additional 63,000 were recorded driving south on the West Side Highway, and perhaps half of those might be considered to have come from New Jersey, across the George Washington Bridge, Mr. Zupan said.  Many other vehicles entering from the north come from a more dispersed area, including the Bronx, several northern counties and Connecticut. The largest number of vehicles, however -- 326,000, or 40 percent of the total -- entered Manhattan over the East River crossings, with their drivers mostly from Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island.  Mr. Schaller uses data from a computer model developed by the transportation council to estimate that about 80 percent of the vehicles in the hub-bound tally had destinations within the Manhattan core.  The model therefore suggests that almost one-fifth of the vehicles that entered Manhattan in the 2003 count, or about 156,000, were just passing through the borough. For many drivers, Manhattan is simply a place between here and there.  ''The shortest way, distance-wise, is always to go through Manhattan,'' said Erick Lawson, a commercial diver who lives in Somerset, N.J., and frequently works on underwater construction jobs in Queens or on Long Island.  Early in the day, he often enjoys a smooth drive, well before the morning rush, through the Lincoln Tunnel and across 34th Street to the Midtown Tunnel. His homebound trip is a different story.  ''It's almost always a disaster,'' Mr. Lawson said, explaining that he frequently drives home across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and through Staten Island to avoid Midtown.  Mr. Zupan pointed to data that show that while the overall number of vehicles entering during a 24-hour period has generally been rising, the number of vehicles entering from 7 to 10 a.m. has remained fairly steady.  ''You can't squeeze any more vehicles between 7 and 10 on the bridges and tunnels,'' he said. ''So that's constant and the growth we've seen is in off-peak travel.''  John Lane, 26, a tattoo artist who lives in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, typically waits until after 11 a.m. to drive his 1963 Buick Skylark to work at Cutting Edge Body Arts in the West Village.  His routine allows him to skip the morning rush and arrive just as street-cleaning restrictions expire, so it is easy to park. He said his half-hour trip would take about the same time on the subway, but he prefers his car. ''I like to be in my own environment,'' Mr. Lane said.  A study conducted last year for the Partnership for New York City, a business group, cited 2000 census data that showed about 35 percent of government workers in Manhattan drive to work, compared with 14 percent for those who work in finance. Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the group, said that many city workers drive because they can park at no charge using parking placards obtained through their agencies.  The morning rush is dominated by cars carrying people to their jobs. But later in the day, the mix of vehicles on the streets of Manhattan includes more drivers who venture out for other reasons.  Andrea Hirshman lives in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, and she often drives her Mazda minivan into Manhattan to go to the theater, meet friends for dinner, attend events at her son's high school on East 29th Street, or visit her mother in Kips Bay. She lives a short walk from the subway but nearly always prefers to drive.  ''In the end you usually find that when you've finished what you're doing you have your car and you can zip home,'' said Ms. Hirschman, 49. ''You have much more mobility and I like it.''  ",

            "text": "  City, state and federal agencies granted final approvals last month to a half-dozen wide-ranging projects in a political aligning of the stars that will promote New York City's most ambitious economic development agenda in decades.  Approval or financing was given to a Second Avenue subway; an extension of the Flushing Line to the Far West Side; a spur to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal; financing for tens of thousands of apartments for low- and moderate-income residents; the Atlantic Yards complex near Downtown Brooklyn, which includes a new home for the basketball Nets; and even the bus-stop shelters and public toilets that New Yorkers and visitors have demanded for years.  Some of the approvals were prompted by legal deadlines and last-minute efforts by departing Pataki administration officials -- including Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation; Peter S. Kalikow, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; and the governor himself -- to stake out their legacy.  But two more enduring forces also converged: the beginning of the last 1,000 days of the Bloomberg administration, and a climate that some urban planners suggest signals at least a lull in the nearly half-century backlash against the bulldozer diplomacy of Robert Moses.  ''It's a pretty amazing list,'' said Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, a group that studies transportation and development issues. ''It's the Bloomberg administration pushing hard. There's a pro-growth, long-range theme behind all this.''  Kenneth T. Jackson, the Columbia University urban historian, said that Mr. Bloomberg's speech in December outlining the challenges posed by a growing population ''signaled that New York had to fight for its place at the table, that real estate and commercial rents and housing prices are getting out of hand. The only way the city can prosper is to make that more reasonable and the only way to do that is to increase the supply.  ''I think they're beginning to move,'' Professor Jackson said.  In the months ahead, the Bloomberg administration's development agenda includes rezoning in Harlem as well as in Jamaica and Willets Point in Queens. The administration also wants to make another effort to gain approval for the transformation of the James A. Farley general post office building in Midtown Manhattan into a commuter rail hub called Moynihan Station -- one proposal that appears to be in political limbo.  ''After 9/11, a spirit of cooperation -- not perfect -- prevailed that enabled people to aim farther than they had in decades,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, who was instrumental in winning many of the approvals. ''The mayor really encouraged that kind of thinking -- repositioning New York City's economy to compete with other cities in the 21st century.''  Several of the approved projects still face court challenges. Some others are bound to raise concerns over displacement and congestion. And the promise of a Second Avenue subway has been dangled before skeptical New Yorkers for nearly 80 years. But even if some projects are delayed, the others would change the city's face and, arguably, help fend off competition from New Jersey and from other world capitals.  ''I think you probably would have to go back to the late 1930s to see anything like that,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''I don't think any mayor has had an agenda like this, not since La Guardia.''  On Dec. 6, the city sold $2 billion in bonds to extend the No. 7 subway line 1.1 miles west and then south from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street to help transform the largely fallow Far West Side.  On Dec. 18, the federal government agreed to grant $2.6 billion to link Long Island Rail Road commuters directly to the East Side of Manhattan and $693 million for the Second Avenue subway from 96th to 63rd Streets.  On Dec. 19, Mr. Pataki presided over the installation of the first two huge steel columns to mark the perimeter of the Freedom Tower at the World Trade Center site.  The same day, Mr. Bloomberg announced the installation of the first 24 of 3,300 bus-stop shelters by a company that will also replace 330 newsstands and install and operate 20 public toilets. The ''street furniture'' will help pay for the city's tourism campaign.  On Dec. 20, the City Council, in a compromise supported by the mayor, voted to overhaul a tax break to induce developers to build tens of thousands of apartments for New Yorkers making less than 80 percent of the median household income, or $56,720 for a family of four.  That day, a state oversight board gave final approval to the $4 billion Atlantic Yards project, a mostly residential complex with a basketball arena, offices and retail space near Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues.  In addition, new stadiums are being built for the Yankees and the Mets.  Brad Lander, the director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a planning group, said: ''My guess is, we are only just now settling into the general sense that the city's growth and development are long-term trends, not a short-time, business-cycle flash.''  Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, said that the city, bolstered by a robust economy, was trying to meet pent-up demand.  ''Say what you want about the scope and size of development,'' he added, ''the projects that are being approved are more sensitive to the current communities and neighborhoods or to creating new ones -- like the new Downtown Brooklyn -- than Moses ever was.''  Moreover, Mr. Dadey said, ''the community boards no longer have the sway they once did over stopping local projects,'' and some local groups are even supporting development -- ''trying to encourage it responsibly in ways that benefit a greater number of people.''  In ''The Power Broker,'' Robert A. Caro in 1974 wrote that without the approval of Robert Moses, who oversaw virtually all public works in New York until he was eased out in 1968, the city was ''utterly unable'' to build anything.  Mr. Caro said in an interview that he, too, was struck by the plethora of projects approved in December.  ''Does this alignment of stars show that this is may be a problem that democracy can solve?'' he said. ''For the first time in 40 years, I'm hopeful.''  ",

            "text": "  Since its coke ovens shut down for the last time in 1998, the mile-long Bethlehem Steel Corporation plant has been a rusty reminder of this small Lehigh Valley city's proud industrial past. Trees have sprouted between the red bricks, and birds have nested in wire baskets in which steel workers once stored their belongings.  But in two years or so, the pinging of thousands of slot machines is likely to fill the eerie silence at the steelworks, which once employed 30,000 people and supplied the steel for landmarks like Rockefeller Center and notable projects like the George Washington Bridge.  Last month, Sands BethWorks Gaming, a partnership of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a hotel and casino company, and a group led by Barry M. Gosin, a New York developer, was awarded one of five hotly contested licenses in Pennsylvania to operate freestanding slots parlors.  Sands BethWorks plans to spend more than $600 million developing a 300-room hotel, a 200,000-square-foot outlet mall and a casino with 3,000 slot machines on a vacant ore field at the former plant. The towering blast furnaces will be illuminated, and a building known as the High House, where battleship guns were manufactured, will be stabilized, the developers said.  The city is expected to approve the final plans within the next few weeks, which would permit the developers to break ground this summer.  Though the first phase of the project involves new construction rather than rehabilitation of the steel plant, the additions have been designed to blend in.  ''We wanted to make it look like an industrial site, to respect what was there and not make it look Disneyesque,'' said Mr. Gosin, who helped transform the industrial Dumbo area of Brooklyn into a popular neighborhood.  In August 2004, Mr. Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank, an international brokerage and property management company, and his partners bought 124 acres of the 1,800-acre steelworks site for what he now acknowledges was a bargain price of $4 million.  The seller was the New York investor Wilbur L. Ross, who acquired the bankrupt steel company in 2003. The steel company, hoping to redevelop some of its unused buildings as a retail and entertainment complex, had already cleaned up the site. The city had invested $10 million on roads, sidewalks and utilities.  Mr. Gosin, who travels to Bethlehem from New York in a chauffeur-driven Bentley, said he had bought the property without realizing it could be used for a casino. Initially, he planned to focus on converting a 52,000-square-foot building that once housed the steel company's headquarters into condominiums.  Later, he struck a deal with Las Vegas Sands, whose executives he had come to know while negotiating the lease for a Barneys store to open this year at the Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas.  Sands, which was founded by Sheldon G. Adelson, the creator of Comdex, Las Vegas's first consumer electronics trade show, is building the Palazzo next to its Venetian Resort Hotel Casino. The company also owns the Sands Casino in Macao and is about to open a Venetian there. In May, it received a license to build Singapore's first gambling resort.  If the Bethlehem project proves successful, Mr. Gosin and William P. Weidner, the president of Las Vegas Sands, said they hoped to expand the hotel, build a convention center and add retail space in a long structure known as No. 2 Machine Shop. Mr. Weidner said he hoped the Bethlehem project would provide a model for the development of other former industrial sites.  Before they could win over the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the developers had to persuade residents that the casino would not alter the charm of their picturesque city of 72,000 along the Lehigh River. Founded by members of the Moravian Church from Eastern Europe in the 18th century, Bethlehem still has many well-tended German-style buildings from that period.  Unlike many towns that have turned to gambling out of desperation, it has a diverse economic base, with several hospitals and academic institutions. Many residents commute to New York City, about 75 miles away, city officials say. The city, which markets itself as Christmas City, is a popular holiday destination.  The developers say the casino is likely to be a catalyst for developing the former plant as a historic and cultural site that would include a long-delayed National Museum of Industrial History, two performance halls and a new home for the local public broadcasting station.  But the museum's prospects are far from certain. The museum, which is affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution, is intended to focus attention on the role of industry in shaping the country's rapid growth, but it has raised only $14 million of the $26 million it needs for its first phase, said Stephen G. Donches, its chief executive.  At the outset, it would be located in a 1913 building the museum acquired years ago from the steel company. Sands BethWorks has given the museum part of No. 2 Machine Shop and the building that served as a locker room for steelworkers -- both would be redeveloped later -- but has limited its financial support to a $25,000 donation.  Mr. Weidner, however, said the discussions with museum officials were just beginning. ''We will contribute more money,'' he said. The developers have also donated a building and 3.5 acres for the cultural uses and plan to set aside an 1863 stone building as a visitors center.  Early on, the casino received enthusiastic support from Bethlehem's mayor, John B. Callahan. Because of the closing of the steel plant, the city's assessed real estate value is 2 percent lower today than in 1994, the mayor said.  The casino operators will be required to pay the city a ''host fee'' of $10 million a year, or 2 percent of their revenue, whichever is higher. (Another 2 percent will go to Northampton County and neighboring Lehigh County.)  The gambling revenue will go a long way in a city with an annual budget of $58.2 million, even though the visitors from Northern New Jersey and New York will also put a burden on municipal services, Mr. Callahan said. ''The host fee will more than compensate for any impacts,'' he said. ''For me, it's a very practical decision.''  Opponents have fought the casino on the ground that it would be too close to several churches, only a few blocks from Lehigh University and out of place in their history-rich city.  Lucy H. Lennon, the owner of the Dancing Fish, a sushi restaurant in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood near the former steel plant, said she was concerned about the casino's impact on the city's small-town character.  ''I don't think the casino is going to ruin Bethlehem,'' she said. ''But I think it's going to change.''  Louis P. Pektor, an unsuccessful local bidder for the Bethlehem Steel site, said he worried that Sands BethWorks would have no incentive to reinvest its revenue in the community. ''Nothing requires them to do it,'' said Mr. Pektor, the owner of Ashley Development, one of the largest developers in the Lehigh Valley.  But Neville Gardner, the owner of Donegal Square, a shop on Main Street that carries Irish and Scottish sweaters and mufflers, said the casino and surrounding development would help retailers by bringing newcomers to Bethlehem.  ''Getting them here the first time is the hardest part,'' he said. ''Once they're here, we find they'll usually come back.''  SQUARE FEET  ",

            "text": "  The proposed New Jersey to Manhattan commuter rail tunnel, widely regarded as vital to the economy of both New York and New Jersey, is moving into a critical period that could decide whether or not it actually gets built.  Largely because of the efforts of New Jersey Transit director George Warrington, who has announced his intention to step down at the end of March, the massive project has blossomed beyond being merely a dream of transportation planners and New Jersey cheerleaders. Officials in New York now support it and want to start construction in 2009.  And just this month, a key federal agency approved a draft of the tunnel's environmental impact statement, an essential step for getting federal funds.  But there are major hurdles to surmount during the next two years. The deficit-plagued federal government will have to come up with up to half of the $7.2 billion estimated cost. And even though the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has pledged $2 billion, New Jersey, which has its own budget problems, may have to come up with more than the $500-million it has promised. And even that may not be enough.  Since Mr. Warrington will not be around to keep the pressure on, there's a risk that some of this necessary funding may dry up or that other smaller, less important pet projects of various politicians may drain off money. It is imperative that New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, a strong supporter of the tunnel, name a successor with the same expertise and sense of commitment that Mr. Warrington has displayed.  The need for the tunnel is enormous. Currently, a 96-year-old Amtrak-owned tunnel with two tracks is the only rail link under the Hudson River. Serving both Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains, the link carries 45,000 passengers each peak period when 24 trains an hour are squeezed through the tunnel. If there is a breakdown, rail transportation between New Jersey and Manhattan stops. The new tunnel, which would end under 34th Street on Manhattan's West Side, would provide essential backup and double the number of trains that could enter and exit Manhattan from New Jersey.  Besides improved service for commuters from west of the Hudson, the new tunnel is essential for New York City's economy, which is expected to become increasingly dependent on workers from New Jersey, Rockland and Orange counties in New York, and even Pennsylvania, as the years go by.  It is this argument that Mr. Warrington used to get Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Charles Schumer and other key New York city and state officials behind the project.  And it is this argument, together with the importance of a healthy New York-New Jersey metropolitan area to the economy of the entire nation, that Mr. Warrington's successor will have to make in Washington to get the needed federal money.  For the tunnel to become a reality, New Jersey Transit will need one of the most able and persuasive mass transit directors in the country.  New Jersey  ",
